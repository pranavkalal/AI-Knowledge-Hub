They are \nalso known for their involvement in mediating tolerance to abiotic and \nbiotic stresses. Studies on the manipulation of genes involve in BR \nbiosynthesis or signalling reveal the essential role of BRs on plant \ndevelopment (Bishop and Yokota, 2001). Loss-of-function mutation of \nthese genes usually leads to multiple developmental defects, male \nsterility, altering stomatal distribution, delay flowering and dwarfism \n(Clouse, 2011). Studies of the BR signaling pathway and BR gene-\nregulation indicate that BR act independently or dependently through \ninteraction with other plants hormones to mediate stress response in \nplants. A group of calmodulin binding proteins, known as CBP60s also \ninvolved in mediating the response of plants to stress. Many CBP60s \nhave been identified at the whole genome level in several plant \nspecies including Arabidopsis, rice and maize (Subbaiah et al., 1994a, \n1994b, 1996, Boonburapong and Buaboocha, 2007).\n Taken together \nthese observations suggest that BR and CBP60s genes can be used as \nstrong targets for increasing plant growth and development under \nvarious stimuli. This will provide valuable information for understanding \nwhether there is a possible connection between BR signalling and \nCBP60 transcription factors in mediating abiotic stress response in \ncotton.  \n \n \n           \n  3 of 4 \nResearch \nactivities \nBrassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that not only play \nvital roles in plant growth and development but also in mediating stress \nresponse. A group of calmodulin binding proteins, known as CBP60s \nare also involved in mediating the response of plants to stress. The \naims of the present study were: (1) to investigate the effect of \nexogenous 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) on the phenotype of cotton \nGossypium. hirsutum seedlings under mild to moderate biotic and \nabiotic stresses, (2) to find and characterise cotton CBP60-encoding \ngenes, orthologous to Arabidopsis CBP60s with known involvement in \nstress responses, and to investigate whether EBR may act by \nmodulating expression of GhCBP60 genes in cotton leaf tissues under \nsalt stress. Experiments were designed to demonstrate the effects of \nEBR application from 0.1 to 2 µM on the phenotypic responses of \ncotton seedlings to mild to moderate salt, drought and pathogen \n(\nVerticillium dahlia) stresses. Results show that the exogenous \napplication of EBR at low concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 µM had no \npositive effect on seedling growth under all stresses. In addition, EBR \nat a higher concentration (0.5 µM) or with the surfactant Tween 20 \ncaused toxic effects. Bioinformatics approaches revealed the presence \nof GhCBP60 orthologues of AtCBP60. Phylogenetic analysis indicated \nthat CBP60a, CBP60g and CBP60h from Arabidopsis each have four \nco-orthologues in cotton. AtCBP60f has two co-orthologues, whereas \nCBP60b/c/d have nine co-orthologues. Multiple amino acid sequence \nalignments indicate that the DNA-binding and CaM-binding domains of \nAtCBP60 are highly conserved in GhCBP60, suggesting similar protein \nstructures to AtCBP60. Prediction of subcellular localisation suggested \nthat all GhCBP60 proteins contain a nuclear localisation signal. This, \ntogether with the highly conserved putative DNA binding region, \nsuggests that all GhCBP60 are transcription factors. The results of qRT-\nPCR demonstrated that EBR treatment of cotton up-regulated the \nexpression of \nGhCBP60a/f/g. On the other hand, salt down-regulated \nthe expression of GhCBP60a but up-regulated the expression of \nGhCBP60f/g. Interestingly, treatment with EBR in the absence of salt \nrestored the expression of GhCBP60a to levels similar to the control \ntissue. Analysis of promoters of GhCBP60 genes for putative BR-\nrelated transcription factor binding motifs indicated the presence of \nCANNTG and GGTCC elements. However, these were not significantly \nenriched in stress-regulated genes. Furthermore, higher stringency BR-\nsignalling-related elements: BRRE (CGTGTG/CGTGCG), G-box \n(CACGTG) and transcription factors TGA 1/TGA 4 (TGACG) sense strand \nwere absent in stress-responsive genes GhCBP60a/f/g/h as compared \nto other groups. In the light of these results, we concluded that BR \npositively regulates the expression of novel \nGhCBP60 genes \nsuggesting a possible connection between BR signalling and GhCBP60 \ntranscription factors in mediating abiotic stress responses in cotton. \nHowever, the results from the cis-element search suggest that this \nconnection is likely to be indirect rather than via a direct interaction \nwith the BR signal transduction pathway. \nOutputs - The exogenous application of EBR on seedling growth under salt, \ndrought and drought stresses showed no positive effect \n- Bioinformatics approaches revealed the presence of GhCBP60 \northologues of AtCBP60 with highly conserved CaM and DNA binding \nregulatory domains that contain nuclear localisation signal suggesting \nsimilar function to AtCBP60 in other plants. \n \n \n           \n  4 of 4 \n- EBR treatment up- regulates the expression of novel GhCBP60a/f/g \ngenes. Similarly, salt up regulates the expression of GhCBP60f/g but \ndown regulate the expression of GhCBP60a in the absence of EBR. \nInterestingly, treatment with EBR in the absence of salt restored the \nexpression of GhCBP60a to similar level with the control tissue. \nHowever, the analysis of promoters of GhCBP60 genes for putative BR-\nrelated transcription suggest that there is indirect link between the \nGhCBP60 and BR-regulated genes. \nImpacts  -The discovery of GhCBP60a/f/g can be used as a molecular tool for \nplant breeding and subsequently will produce breakthroughs in \nunderstanding the stress signalling mechanisms and adaptation in \ncotton. \n-The new insights obtained will be considered as a foundation for \nfuture studies to illustrate the mechanism of GhCBP60 proteins and \ntheir relation to BR signal transduction pathways in cotton. \nKey publications -The following two chapters will be published in two journals.  \n1-The Structure, Phylogeny and Prediction of Subcellular Localisation of \nCalmodulin-binding Protein 60 (CBP60) in Cotton G hirsutum. \nExpression profiling of GhCBP60 in cotton seedlings treated with \nbrassinosteroids and salt, and analysis of cis-regulatory elements.  \n   \n \nReferences  \nClouse, S.

Abstract \nExcess nutrients and contaminants in watercourses have detrimental consequences for \nhuman health and riverine ecosystems. During droughts, thousands of fish can die under \npoor water quality conditions, and these fish deaths often become the focus point for \ndebates about how we should manage water allocations throughout the Murray-Darling \nBasin and wider Australia. Greater scientific data and knowledge of flow impacts are needed \nto guide water delivery decisions to minimise periods of poor water quality.   \n  \nUsing water quality (electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen) and water stable isotope \ndata (δ2H and δ18O signatures), we investigated the impact of dam water releases and other \nanthropogenic activities on water quality in the Lower Murrumbidgee Catchment \n(September 2018 - February 2020) during drought. Supporting precipitation and stream flow \ndata were analysed to yield insights into the impact of dam water releases on water quality.  \n \nDam water only took nine days to travel 560 km from its release at Blowering Reservoir, on \nthe Tumut River, to Carrathool Bridge on the lower Murrumbidgee River. Along this reach of \nthe river, both the electrical conductivity and water stable isotope data indicate that water \nquality was controlled by the dam water releases. Degraded water quality was restricted to \nwater from irrigation channels and water management ponds.  \n \nDuring droughts, water quality in the Murrumbidgee is not impacted by surface water \nrunoff from urban centre or irrigated agricultural districts. The primary influence on water \nquality was determined to be the regulated delivery of water from dams and weirs.  \nMy research demonstrates that the conservative use of environmental water is required \nduring normal and wet conditions to increase the availability of water during droughts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n2. Introduction  \n2.1. Aims and background \nThe human population relies heavily upon rivers for trade, transportation, industry, \ndomestic water supplies and agriculture. Subsequently, rivers have become extremely \nregulated around the world, often resulting in the degradation of water supply and quality \n(Prosser et al. 2001; Gibson et al. 2002). Therefore, there is a basic need to improve the \nmanagement of water supplies, which would in turn enhance human and riverine \necosystem health. To do this a greater scientific understanding of the hydrosphere and \nassociated processes is needed on a catchment scale (Hughes & Crawford, 2013).   \n \nWater quality is defined by the physical, chemical, biological and aesthetic characteristics of \nwater (DPIE, 2019). Water quality worsens as rivers flow through regions where land and \nwater are intensely developed, impacted by pollution from increasing agricultural and urban \nactivities (Prosser et al. 2001; Ren & Kingsford, 2014; Verstraeten et al. 2007; DPIE, 2020a). \nExcess nutrients and contaminants from these activities (such as nitrate from fertilisers) \ndegrade downstream water quality and threaten local ecosystems, entering rivers through \nsediment delivery and surface water runoff (Prosser et al. 2001; Verstraeten et al. 2007). \nThese excess nutrients can promote the growth of blue-green algae and lead to mass fish \nkills (Baldwin, 2019).  \n \nThe sequence of water management decisions that result in poor water quality in some \nAustralian rivers is not well understood (Harrison, 1994). There is an urgent need to improve \nwater management decisions relating to the release of consumptive and environmental \nwater from dams to mitigate detrimental environmental outcomes, especially in the context \nof drought (Page et al. 2005; Kingsford & Thomas, 2004).    \n \n My research aims to investigate the impacts of dam releases and off-farm movement of \nsurface water on water quality in the Murrumbidgee Catchment of the Murray-Darling \nBasin. It also aims to provide industry, government and other stakeholders data and insights \nthat will better guide water management decisions in future droughts. This is achieved \nthrough the utilization of water quality results and water stable isotope signatures collected \nas part of this study, supported with rainfall and streamflow data (BOM, 2020).  \n3 \n \n \n2.2. The study area \nThe Murrumbidgee river, part of the Murray Darling Basin in New South Wales (NSW), \nextents over an area of 84,000 km2 from its source in the Snowy Mountains (Figure 1; Green \net al. 2011; Wen, 2009). It is one of the most regulated river systems in Australia, with 26 \ndams and weirs and over 10,000 km of irrigation channels (Wen et al. 2011; Page et al. \n2005). The major land use in this region is dryland pasture used for livestock grazing (Green, \net al. 2011).  \n \nThe Murrumbidgee Catchment is characterised by meandering channels and wide \nfloodplains, which provides essential aquatic habitats for 23 recorded native fish species and \nover 400 recorded native invertebrate species (Green et al. 2011). The mid-Murrumbidgee \nWetlands are nationally significant, supporting river red gum forest and blackbox \nwoodlands. These wetlands include the Ramsar listed Fivebough and Tuckerbil Wetlands \n(Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, 2020a.; DPIE, 2020b.). The \nFivebough wetlands receive approximately 2.5 million litres (ML) of water from the \nadjoining Sewage Treatment Plant under an environmental protection licence (DPIE, n.d.).  \n \nFor the purpose of this study, we focus on the Murrumbidgee Catchment, from Tumut to \nCarrathool, which is separated by approximately 560 km of the Murrumbidgee River (Figure \n1). This catchment was selected as its water resources are the most developed and \nregulated of the Murray-Darling Basin, with the Murrumbidgee River also typical of a semi-\narid river system (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019; Green et al. 2011). Irrigated commodities \nproduced in the Murrumbidgee Catchment include annual crops including rice, pasture, \ncereals, vegetables and oil seeds and perennial crops such as wine grapes and citrus (Green \net al. 2011). Most of these crops are grown in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) and \nthe Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA). The two primary dams controlling water flow in the \nstudy area include Blowering Dam and Burrinjuck Dam that control water for the MIA and \nCIA (Figure 1) (Green et al. 2011; Wen et al. 2011).  \n \nBefore river regulation, streamflow was seasonal, with peak flows occurring during winter \nand spring due to higher rainfall and snow melt. This has been altered by dams and weirs, \n4 \n \nwith peak flows occurring in spring and summer to accommodate the needs of the irrigation \nindustry (Kingsford & Thomas, 2004; Gell & Little, 2007).  \n \nFlood peaks and flows of the Murrumbidgee River have significantly decreased downstream \nof Wagga Wagga, due to factors including distributary diversions (Page et al. 2005; \nChessman et al. 2010). These include the Main Canal and the Sturt Canal, which provide \nwater for the MIA. The MIA covers an area of approximately 3,624 km2 and is situated to the \nnorth of the Murrumbidgee River downstream of Narrandera.  The CIA to the south of the \nMurrumbidgee River comprises of an area over 790 km2. Water is diverted to the CIA from \n41 km of the Main Canal and 477 km of supply channels (Figure 1) (Green et al. 2011).  \n \nIn the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas, drainage water is recycled through the complex and \ninterconnected irrigation supply, drainage and wetland systems. Excess water is discharged \ninto lagoons and designated areas (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019). For example, excess \nflows from the MIA channel system often escape to Mirool Creek, where it is abstraced by \nirrigators, diverted back into the channel system or released to Barren Box Swamp. Barren \nBox Swamp is used to store water from supply irrigators, stock and domestic users (Green et \nal. 2011). \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nFigure 1: Site location – Murrumbidgee Catchment. \n \nWater quality degradation within the study area has been attributed to a combination of \nfactors, including alteration to natural flow regimes, land use change and changes to \ncatchment conditions by major dams (DPIE, 2020a).  \n \n Impacts of altered streamflow are seen downstream of the study area, to the west of Hay in \nthe Lowbidgee Floodplain (Figure 1). This floodplain is nationally significant, providing an \nessential drought refuge and breeding habitat for waterbirds (Kingsford & Thomas, 2004; \nRogers et al. 2013). Degradation of this floodplain has ocurred, with the development of \n97,000 ha of the wetland into the Lowbidgee Irrigation Area (LIA, Figure 1), making the area \neven more sensitive to water resource regulation. Kingsford & Thomas (2004) reported the \ncollapse of waterbird populations by 90% over 19 years (1983 to 2001),  from approximately \n140,000 between (1983 – 1986) to 14,200 (1998 – 2001) (Kingsford & Thomas, 2004).  \n \nThe Lowbidgee Floodplain is still the largest wetland area remaining in the Murrumbidgee \nValley, home to the largest contiguous river red gum forests in Australia, as well as \nsignificant black box, lignum and reed- bed communities (Rogers, et al. 2013; Figure 1). \n\n6 \n \nThese significant ecological communities must be protected and restored from impacts of \nwater resource regulation under Commonwealth law (Commonwealth Environmental Water \nOffice, 2019).  \n \n2.3. Management issues \nHistorically many of the largest ecological impacts of poor water quality have occurred \nduring droughts (Mosley, 2015). The low stream flows, low oxygen levels and high \ntemperatures associated with droughts cause blue-green algal blooms, triggering mass fish \nkills in the lower Murrumbidgee River (Baumgartner, 2004). The severity of impacts of \ndrought conditions and subsequent low flow conditions is heightened by weirs and river \ndiversions, reducing or eliminating flows and promoting the stratification of waterbodies. \nThis is when cold, hypoxic deep water is separated from the warmer, oxygenated water at \nthe surface (Kopf et al. 2019; Baldwin, 2019). Shallow waterbodies such as weirs are \nsensitive to changes in climate, with passing storms having the potential to cause \ndestratification, whereby the mixing of stratified layers occurs that decreases overall oxygen \nconcentrations (Baldwin, 2019).  \n \nSeveral thousand fish are estimated to have died at Redbank Weir (100 km west of Hay) in \nlate January 2020 due to destratification of water following a cold front (Balranald Shire \nCouncil, 2019). To maximise the survival of remaining native fish and improve dissolved \noxygen concentrations and water quality at Redbank Weir, 27,600 ML of environmental \nwater was released (Baldwin, 2019). The issue of mass fish kills extends beyond the \nMurrumbidgee Catchment, affecting other catchments within the Murray-Darling Basin. An \nestimated hundreds of thousands to millions of native fish also died in a series of fish kills in \nthe lower Darling River in the summer of 2018 - 2019 (Jackson & Head, 2020). \n \nThe substantial degradation of ecosystems in basin wetlands due to river regulation led to \nthe development of the NSW Water Management Act 2000, with the objective of the \nsustainable and integrated management of NSW’s water (DPIE, 2019). This act governs \nwater regulation and management in NSW and the Water Sharing Plan development \nframework, that outlines how consumptive and environmental water is delivered (Driver et \nal. 2013). Since 2009, Commonwealth environmental water has been delivered to sites \n7 \n \nacross the Murrumbidgee Catchment to restore wetland habitats (Department of \nAgriculture, Water and the Environment, 2020a.). However, these environmental flows have \nbeen constrained by other demands within the catchment, comprising of smaller volumes of \nwater than the natural flows they replace (Glenn et al. 2017).  \n \nGlenn et al. (2017) assessed the effectiveness of four environmental flow programs that \naimed to restore riparian vegetation in four arid zone rivers in China, Arizona, Mexico and \nAustralia. The Australian case study focused on environmental flows that were provided to \nsmall portions of the Yanga National Forest of the Lowbidgee Floodplains during the \nMillennial Drought (2000 - 2010). The effectiveness of this campaign was assessed through \nthe analysis of satellite vegetation indices. This study found that larger volumes of total \nflows was needed over longer periods to achieve target restoration goals for the \nMurrumbidgee Catchment. A greater understanding of the hydrological cycle is needed to \ninform future watering actions and guide management decisions for Murrumbidgee \nCatchment.  \n \n2.4. Water quality indicators and streamflow \nWater quality indicators, such as dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC) and pH \nhave been utilised extensively to assess the water quality of rivers and catchments within \nAustralia. A study by Whitworth et al. (2012) delineated the causes of an extensive hypoxic \nblackwater event, characterised by high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and low \nDO concentrations of river water, that occurred in the southern Murray-Darling Basin from \n2010 to 2011. Whitworth et al. (2012) utilised historical datasets of water quality and \nhydrology from 2010 - 2011 to find that the post-drought release of water from headwaters \nand the release of hypolimnetic (statified cold, deeper water) of weirs contributed to the \nobserved hypoxia of localised waterways.  \n \nStudies such as Dyer et al. (2014) have successfully utilised publicly available historical data \nto assess the relationship between flow and water quality. Dyer et al. (2014) demonstrated \nthe effectiveness of streamflow and water quality tracers to predict climatic influences \nwithin the Murrumbidgee Catchment. The relevance of this approach is recognised \ninternationally, with findings from a study based in a river catchment in France, that found a \n8 \n \nstrong correlation between climatic conditions, water quality (concentrations of nitrate, \nchloride, sulfate, and DO and inorganic carbon) and hydro-climatic variables (Aubert et al. \n2013).  \n \n2.5. Water stable isotopes  \nWater stable isotopes offer a unique insight into the various processes that occur in the \nhydrosphere. Stable isotopes can be used as highly valuable tracers for processes relating to \nsurface water, including precipitation, influx from groundwater and evaporation (Hughes et \nal. 2012). For this study, water stable isotopes have been utilised to provide insight into the \npotential mixing of sources of water and the extent of evaporation along the Murrumbidgee \nRiver and regions of distributed water.  \n \nThe stable isotope signature of surface water largely represents the composition of rainfall, \namong other inputs such as groundwater inflows (Hughes et al. 2012; Hollins et al. 2018). \nHydrogen has two stable isotopes (1H and 2H) and oxygen has three stable isotopes \n(16O, 17O, and 18O). The cross analysis of the stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen (2H/1H) and \noxygen (18O/16O), reported in the relative delta scale as δ2H and δ18O respectively, can give \ninsight into the processes of precipitation and evaporation in relation to surface water \n(Hughes et al. 2012).  This isotopic signature is modified through kinetic isotopic \nfractionation, an irreversible reaction (Jasechko, 2019). Isotopic fractionation is defined by \nthe partitioning of heavy and light isotopes in exchange reactions (Craig, 1961; Horita & \nWesolowski, 1994).  \n \nThe initial liquid phase of rain is enriched in 2H and 18O as compared to that of later \nprecipitation. As rain falls, precipitation becomes isotopically depleted of 2H and 18O as it \ncontinues. Subsequently, precipitation becomes more depleted in 2H and 18O as it passes \nthrough the continental interior, a phenomenon known as the “continental \neffect” (Jasechko, 2019).  \n \nThe relationship between δ2H and δ18O for isotopic compositions in precipitation at certain \nlocations is characterised by a linear meteoric water line (MWL) (Figure 3). The global \nmeteoric water line (GMWL) was first defined by Craig (1961) to be δ2H =8*δ 18O +10, which \nprovides a generic global representation of the isotopic composition of rainwater.  \n9 \n \n \nLocal meteoric water lines (LMWL) are defined by a linear regression analysis of δ2H and \nδ18O at a restricted geographical region. LMWLs can give regression coefficients \nthat differ from that of the GMWL, due to processes resulting in the kinetic isotopic \nfractionation of precipitation (Jasechko, 2019; Hughes et al. 2012). Hollins et al. (2018) \ndefined the LMWL for Wagga Wagga to be δ2H =8.03*δ 18O +14.38, using monthly data \nrecorded over eight to twelve years.   \n \nThrough evaporation the proportion of heavy isotope species (2H and 18O) increases due to \nadditional kinetic isotopic effects during diffusion (Figure 2). This means the lighter \nisotopes of 16O and 1H will preferentially enter the vapour phase first, with remaining \nsurface water becoming enriched in heavier isotopes (2H and 18O) (Jasechko, 2019; Simpson \net al. 1991). This isotopic enrichment of surface water can be seen along ‘evaporation lines’ \ndefined as slopes less than the MWL (Hughes et al. 2012) (Figure 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Effects of various hydrologic processes on water stable isotope ratios (Arizona \nBoard of Regents, 2005). Note: δ2H = relative delta scale of hydrogen; δ18O = relative delta \nscale of oxygen. \nAdditionally, as rain falls its isotopic signature can be affected by moisture exchange with \nsurrounding vapour and undergo sub-cloud evaporation, increasing 18O and decreasing \ndeuterium excess (d-excess) (Hollins et al. 2018). D-excess is related to the physical \nconditions (humidity, air temperature and sea surface temperature) of the original \nprecipitation source, reflecting conditions during the evolution and mixing of air masses \n\n10 \n \nprior to precipitation. Internationally, d-excess has proved a useful tool to characterise \ncirculation in polar regions and evaluate general circulation models (Froehlich et al. 2002).  \n \nMeredith et al. (2009) highlighted the need to use multiple tracers to understand \nhydrological complexities in dryland systems. This study compared streamflow with \nhydrochemical and stable isotope data from samples collected along the Darling River from \n2002 to 2007. Meredith et al. (2009) found that temporal variation of isotopic and \nhydrochemical tracers was strongly related to changes in flow conditions. During periods of \nlow flow, chloride (Cl−), sodium (Na+), magnesium (Mg2+), suflate (SO42−), δ2H and δ18O \nvalues increased, with d-excess values becoming more negative. After a storm and \nsubsequent flow event, isotopically depleted waters were introduced to the system, \nreturning d-excess to the local meteoric value.  \n \nOn a continental scale, Hollins et al. (2018) interpreted δ2H and δ18O signatures, by \nincorporating historical Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) data for seven \nAustralian sites (1962 - 2002) with 8 to 12 years of monthly data from 15 sites from 2003 -\n2014. This study developed annual isoscapes of δ2H, δ18O and d-excess for precipitation \nacross Australia.  \nThese local and continental studies have contributed significantly to international \nknowledge, by examining isotopic compositions to effectively trace complex processes \nwithin the hydrological cycle. The findings of Meredith et al. (2009) and Hollins et al. (2018) \ncontributed to the Global Network for Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR) and GNIP programs. These \nshared platforms allow for a greater understanding of complex climatic processes on a \ncontinental and global scale. There is a need to further define regional and local isotope \nsignatures to achieve a greater understanding of the hydrological system for dry-land rivers \nof semi-arid Australia (Hollins et al. 2018). My research will aid to address this knowledge \ngap, by examining water stable isotope ratios from the Lower Murrumbidgee Catchment of \nthe Murray-Darling Basin. \n3. Methods  \nThe study consisted of six surface water monitoring and sampling rounds. These were \nconducted in September 2018, February 2019, June 2019, September 2019, November 2019 \n11 \n \nand February 2020 to capture seasonal influence on water quality in the \nLower Murrumbidgee Catchment. A total of twenty-one surface water sampling locations \nwere carefully selected based on their proximity to weirs and surface water diversions, \nirrigation areas and towns to assess the impacts of these various forms of land use. To \nsupport the analysis of the field data, publicly available rainfall and streamflow datasets \nwere explored, placing the prevailing climatic conditions during the study into context.  \n \n3.1. Field measurements and sample collection  \nWater quality parameters of surface waters were recorded in situ at each location using a \nYSI-556 MPS multiprobe (YSI) water quality meter. This meter measures the temperature \n(°C), EC (μS/cm), total dissolved solids (TDS) (mg/L), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) (%), and \noxidation-reduction potential (± mV) (Table 1, Appendix A). The YSI meter was calibrated for \nall parameters before each sampling campaign and daily for DO and pH to avoid instrument \ndrift between days. Calibration of the pH probe was acceptable with values within 0.01 +/- \npH units of known values. The electrodes were placed deep enough into the surface water \nto establish electrical contact. The pH, temperature and EC of the sample were read \nimmediately after 60 seconds and recorded to nearest 0.1 pH unit and 1.0 EC unit (μS/m). \nGeneral notes were taken regarding the flow of the river with photographic evidence to \nrecord the condition of the embankment. River water stable isotope samples (δ2H and δ18O) \nwere collected using a peristaltic pump, purging the line for two minutes prior to \nsampling, with 30 ml bottles rinsed with sample water.  \n \nThe primary sampling locations revisited throughout the study include sampling location 1, \n12, 13, 4 and 5, from upstream to downstream along the Murrumbidgee River (Figure 3). \nSampling location 2 and 3 were only visited in the initial monitoring round in spring 2018, to \nestablish water quality conditions at headwaters (location 2) and other primary river \nchannels (location 3). Revisited sampling locations from irrigation infrastructure include \nsampling location 13, an irrigation intake channel, and sampling location 14, an irrigation \ndisposal site.  \n \nAdditional sampling locations were also monitored that targeted irrigation infrastructure \nand wetlands to understand the effect of irrigation diversions on water quality (Figure 3). \n12 \n \nThe collection of water samples from such locations was often opportunistic. For example, \nafter a period of heavy rainfall a water sample was collected at a pond adjacent to a large \nirrigated agricultural area (Location 18). A water sample was also collected at the irrigation \nwastewater and farm water runoff disposal site at Barren Box Wetlands (location 21, Figure \n3) (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019). This wetland is frequently dry, and water samples could \nonly be collected at this site on one occasion. \n13 \n \n3 \n14 \n \n3.2. Water quality parameters \nWater electrical conductivity (EC) is a measure of the concentrations of dissolved ions in \nwater. These ions include Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4- , HCO3- and CO3-, which generally \nconstitute the major ionic load in most freshwater (Zinabu et al. 2002). Raw EC \nmeasurements are corrected to a standard temperature of 25°C for direct comparison.  \nThe mean electrical conductivity (EC) (μS/cm) was mapped for all samples collected using \nArcMap 10.8 software, using proportional symbols to show the variation of EC measured \nacross the catchment. The distribution of EC has been visually represented by a box and \nwhisker plot. This summarises the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and \nmaximum EC reading for each location. \n \n3.3. Water stable isotopes (δ2H and δ18O)  \nThe relative difference of stable isotope ratios (δ) was determined for deuterium/hydrogen \n(2H/1H) and oxygen (18O/16O) referred to as δ2H and δ18O, respectively. Stable water isotope \nratios for samples were analysed at ANSTO using cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) on a \nPicarro L2130-i analyser. The δ2H and δ18O precision values were reproducible to ±1 ‰ and \n±0.15 ‰, respectively. \n \nWater stable isotope values (δ2H and δ18O) are reported as a per mil (‰) deviation from the \nVienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) standard (Dansgaard, 1964; Wallace, 2010). \nThis is expressed as:  \n \nδ isotope (in ‰) = ((RSample/RStandard)-1) * 1000.  \n \nOnce generated, water isotope results and associated MWLs were plotted using Grapher \nSoftware. This allowed climatic conditions and evaporation trends to be assessed, \ncomplimented with d-excess values calculated by d = δ2H – 8 × δ18O (Hollins et al. 2018).  \n \n15 \n \n3.4. Rainfall and streamflow data \n3.4.1. Rainfall Data \nHistorical rainfall data (1872-2019) at station 72042 was explored to establish long term \nclimatic conditions (BOM, 2020). This station is located at the headwaters of the catchment \nand had the longest rainfall dataset in the study area.   \n \nA cumulative rainfall departure graph was produced, allowing the assessment of long-term \nrainfall trends (Weber & Stewart, 2004). The mean total annual rainfall (1872 - 2019) was \ncalculated, which was was subtracted from the total rainfall of each year to give an annual \nresidual rainfall value (positive residuals indicate above average rainfall, and negative are \nbelow average rainfall). The residual values were then accumulated and graphed.  \n \n3.4.2. Streamflow data \nThe assessment of streamflow allows for the nature and influence of dams and diversions to \nbe evaluated. Streamflow data were retrieved from Water NSW Real Time Data \n(https://realtimedata.waternsw.com.au) for eight hydrologic stations. These stations were \nselected based on their proximity to the sampling locations, weirs, dams and towns. Details \nof these stations and associated sampling locations are provided in Table 2, Appendix B, \nwith station locations also illustrated in Figure 3. Streamflow data is limited to primary river \nchannels, as there is no available streamflow data from gauging stations north of \nNarrandera. Streamflow data at selected locations is still fit for purpose, as it effectively \nrepresents the rapid redistribution of water from headwater dams to the main river and \nirrigation districts.  \n4. Results \n4.1. Rainfall data  \nThe mean annual rainfall recorded at Tarcutta Post Office (Station 72042) for years 1872 to \n2019 was 656 mm (Figure 4A). Mean annual rainfall over the study period was much lower \nthan the long-term average, with 415 mm and 354 mm recorded in 2018 and 2019, \nrespectively.   \n \n16 \n \nThe cumulative rainfall departure graph visually represents the context of the sampling \nperiod relative to wet and dry runs. Where the slope of the curve is increasing, rainfall \nexceeds the long-term average, reflecting wetter conditions (1915 - 2000, Figures 4A and \n4B). Conversely, where the slope of the curve is decreasing, rainfall for the period is less \nthan the average, indicating arid conditions (2001 – 2009, Figures 4A and 4B) (Green et al. \n2011). The calculation of cumulative rainfall departure has a negative slope for September \n2018 to February 2020, indicating the study was conducted during an extremely dry period \nFigure 4A & B) (BOM, 2020). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFigure 4: A.

Streamflow data \nStreamflow, or discharge, is a measure of water flowing through the cross section of a \nstream (DPIE, 2019). \n \nIn a natural river system, high rainfall would be predicted to increase expected river \ndischarge. In the Murrumbidgee Catchment there is no significant correlation between \nrainfall and streamflow for stations located nearest to Blowering Reservoir (Figure 5).  \n \nFigure 5: Daily discharge (ML/day) recorded near headwaters at Gundagai (Station 410004) \nand daily rainfall recorded at the corresponding weather station at Tarcutta Post Office \n(Station 72042), showing no significant correlation between rainfall and discharge. \nFigure 6A shows the mean daily discharge recorded at eight stations during the study. \nStations located closest to Burrinjuck Dam had the highest values for mean daily discharge, \nwith discharge decreasing with increasing distance from the dam. Peak and trough values \nfor discharge at Station 410004 was mirrored at all downstream station locations, \ndemonstrating the rapid transfer of water from dam releases along the Murrumbidgee \nRiver.

The water \nwas released into the Tumut River (where Station 410006 is located). The Tumut River joins \nthe Murrumbidgee at Gundagai (Station 410004), before travelling west towards the Darling \nRiver. It took approximately 9 days for the dam water release to travel from the Tumut River \ngauging station (410006) to the Carrathool Bridge (Station 41000281) on the lower \nMurrumbidgee in the far west of the study area (Figure 6B, Figure 3). The streamflow rate \ndecreases from east to west (moving downstream), due to various water losses attributed \nto back storage, urban and irrigation withdrawals and decreasing river gradient \n(Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, 2020b.). Discharge had decreased \nby 61% from 8109.7 ML/day at Gundagai (Station 410004) to 3160.9 ML/day at Carrathool \nBridge (Station 41000281). Discharge in the study period is much lower in comparison to \ntimes of high rainfall. For example, the mean daily discharge recorded for Gundagai (Station \n410004) decreased from 10,417 ML/day in 2010 to 3,675 ML/day in 2019, a decrease of \n65%. Similarly, the mean daily discharge at Carrathool Bridge (Station 41000281) decreased \n76% between 2010 and 2019, from 6,559 ML/day to 1,554 ML/day, respectively.  \n \n20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6: A.

Water quality results \nEC ranged from 28 to 1880 μS/cm for all samples (n=49). EC was consistent across sampling \nrounds and from upstream to downstream locations along the Murrumbidgee River (sample \nlocations east to west: 1, 12, 4 and 5) (Figure 7). Sample locations within the irrigation \ndistrict had higher values for EC and high variability between sampling rounds (sample \nlocations 13 and 14) (Figure 7).  \n \n \nFigure 7: Box plot of EC for sample locations revisited throughout study, showing very little \nvariation between upstream and downstream sample locations along the Murrumbidgee \nRiver. In contrast, sample locations within irrigation infrastructure had a higher variation of \nconductivity values, with sampling location 13 representative of irrigation intake (at Talbot \nLake) and sampling location 14 situated within an irrigation disposal site (terminal lake at \nMirool Creek). \nThe lowest EC result was 28 μS/cm, recorded at the first sampling location downstream of \nthe Blowering Reservoir (sampling location 2), reflective of a freshwater source. This low \nvalue appears to coincide with a dam release on the 9th of September 2018, as depicted in \nFigure 6B. EC was only 79 μS/cm at Carrathool (sampling location 5), the furthest \ndownstream location situated along the Murrumbidgee River. Mean EC values for locations \nElectrical conductivity (μS/cm)  \n22 \n \nalong the Murrumbidgee River and other main river channels was below 200 μS/cm (Figure \n8).  \n \nThe highest EC values were recorded at locations disconnected from the primary rivers and \nchannels (sites 13 and 14, Figure 7).  The highest EC reading (of 1880 μS/cm), was recorded \nat Barren Box Swamp (Site 20, Figures 3 and 8), a natural wetland area that was partly \nredeveloped for the purpose of water storage and recycling (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, \n2019). \n \n \n23 \n \n \n\n24 \n \nThere is an inverse relationship between EC and discharge at station locations situated along \nthe Murrumbidgee River and Gundagai (Figure 9A) and Wagga Wagga (Figure 9B).

Findings of this study support \nthe seasonal influence on surface water temperatures, with recorded temperatures much \nhigher in summer months (average temperatures of 25°C in summer, in comparison to 11°C \nin winter and 14°C in spring; Figure 10). In general, disconnected locations and irrigation \nchannel water were characterised by higher temperatures (median of 22.1°C) and lower \ndissolved oxygen concentrations (median of 69%) than those locations along the main river \nchannel, that have a median water temperature of 16.1°C and a median of 93% for DO \nconcentrations (Figure 10). Notably, sample locations 18, 19 and 21 had high temperatures \n(greater than 25 °C) and low dissolved oxygen (below 11%; Figure 10). This trend could be \nthe result of warmer temperatures and lower flows experienced in summer months \n(Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019). \n \nFigure 10: The relationship between recorded surface water temperature (°C) and dissolved \noxygen (%) for all samples (n=49). \n \n4.4. Water stable isotopes ratios \nThe δ2H and δ18O values ranged from their most enriched at +55.01‰ and +12.87 ‰ \n(sample location 20) to their most depleted at -89.19 ‰ and -11.53 ‰ (sample location 18) \n(Figure 11A). This is consistent with findings of Meredith et al. (2009) for samples collected \n\n26 \n \nat Cobar between September 2006 to January 2009. The δ2H and δ18O signatures reported \nby Meredith et al. (2009) ranged from their most enriched at +43.0‰ and +7.03‰ in \nOctober 2008 to their most depleted at -77.3‰ and -11.05‰ in September 2006. Unlike \nMeredith et al. (2009), the greatest differences between isotope signatures for samples \ncollected in this study cannot be completely linked with the timing of sample collection, \nwith differences instead attributed to location type (whether samples were collected from \nthe main river or irrigation district channels) (Figure 11A and Figure 3).  \n \nThe Murrumbidgee catchment water samples sit on a linear trend in the δ2H vs δ18O plot \n(Figure 11). The R2 value of the fitted linear regression is 0.93, indicating a good fit.  \nCompared to the GMWL and LMWL the local Murrumbidgee trend has a gentler gradient \n(5.46) and is downward offset to more negative δ2H values for δ18O >-4 ‰. This contrasts \nthe findings of previous studies, with Gibson et al. (2008) reporting that 2H and 18O \nenrichment in dryland rivers typically follows evaporation lines with a gradient close to 4.  \n \nWeighted averages for d-excess values over this study were found to be 9.78 ‰ for samples \ncollected along the main river channels (n=30). This is comparative to findings of Hollins et \nal. (2018), that reported average annual precipitation d-excess values of 14.18 ‰ for Wagga \nWagga from 2003 to 2014. These d-excess values contrast those for samples collected along \nirrigation infrastructure (n=17), whereby average d-excess values of -1.39 ‰ were recorded.  \n \nIsotope values for samples collected from the Murrumbidgee River, Main Canal and \nColumbo Creek cluster together, with values from around -10.2 to -37.6 ‰ for δ2H and -6.0 \nto -1.2 ‰ for δ18O (Figure 11B). Within this cluster, the stable water isotope values for \nsamples collected in spring of 2018 (September) and spring of 2019 (September and \nNovember) generally lie between the GMWL (Craig, 1961) and the Wagga Wagga LMWL \n(Hollins, 2018). However, values of δ2H and δ18O for samples collected in summer 2019 \n(February) and summer 2020 (February) lie below LMWL for Wagga Wagga, suggesting the \ninfluence of evaporation (Hollins et al. 2018).  \n \nIn contrast, δ2H and δ18O ratios for samples collected in winter (2019) have a larger range, \nfalling between the LMWL and GMWL for sample locations along the main river channel (1, \n27 \n \n4, 5 and 12).  δ2H and δ18O values follow a ‘regional evaporation line’ for disconnected \nsample locations (13, 14 and 16), indicating a greater influence of evaporation at these  \nlocations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11: A. δ2H and δ18O ratios for all samples collected within the lower Murrumbidgee \nCatchment. B. Stable water isotope values for samples falling within primary cluster. \nA. \nB. \n28 \n \nWithin the primary cluster, stable water isotope values for samples are closely grouped with \nothers of the same sampling round, indicating minor seasonal influence. However, stable \nwater isotope values for samples collected in June 2019 have a much greater range in \ncomparison to those collected during other seasons within the primary cluster (Figures 11A \nand 11B). \n \nThere are multiple groups of samples outside of the primary cluster for sample locations 10, \n11, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. Sample locations with stable water isotope values to the left of the \nprimary cluster are associated with recent sources of precipitation from storm systems, with \nsamples depleted in δ2H and δ18O values (Hughes & Crawford, 2013). Alternatively, samples \nto the right of the primary cluster correspond to locations that have been exposed to \nseasonal evaporation following local water storage, resulting in the enrichment of δ2H and \nδ18O values. \n5. Discussion \nMy research provides insight into the drivers of water quality in the Lower Murrumbidgee \nCatchment from September 2018 to February 2020. Findings of my research may guide the \ndevelopment of improved water management strategies for the Murray-Darling Basin \nduring future droughts.  \n \n5.1. Sources and sinks of surface water \nStreamflow in the study area (Figure 3) is heavily regulated by government water policies \nand does not mirror natural climatic conditions, shown by the cross-analysis of rainfall and \ndischarge data (Figure 5). There was no relationship between daily rainfall recorded at \nTarcutta Post Office and discharge recorded at Gundagai (Station 410004) over the study \nperiod. Discharge was lowest in winter months and highest in spring and summer months \n(Figure 6A). This reflects the demands of the irrigated agriculture sector, primarily for \ngrowing crops including rice, pasture, cereals, vegetables and oil seeds and perennial crops \nsuch as wine grapes and citrus (Kingsford & Thomas, 2004; O'Gorman, 2013; Green et al. \n2011).  \n \n29 \n \nWater is very quickly transferred from headwater dams through the main river channels. \nWater released on the 5th of August 2018 took nine days to travel approximately 560 km \nfrom Tumut River to Carrathool Bridge along the Murrumbidgee River (Figure 6B). The high \nimpact of streamflow diversions and subsequent rapid abstraction of water by irrigators is \napparent in Figure 6B, with a 61% decrease in recorded discharge from Gundagai to \nCarrathool in August 2018, assuming no evaporation or transmission losses.   \n \nThe homogeneity of water quality results and isotope signatures along the Murrumbidgee \nRiver is indicative of fast water transfer rates (Figures 7 and 8). Homogenous and depleted \nδ2H and δ18O values for water sampled in spring and summer along the main river channels \nsuggests that in-channel evaporation is minimal (Figure 11B) (Simpson & Herczeg, 1991; \nHughes et al. 2012). Under natural conditions, a large catchment such as the Murrumbidgee \nwould be expected to show variability in water stable isotopes, due to forcing from seasonal \nclimatic influences (Hollins et al. 2018). The cluster of stable water isotope signatures (10.2 \nto -37.6 ‰ for δ2H and -6.0 to -1.2 ‰ for δ18O; Figure 11B) provides evidence of a single \norigin of surface water for each round monitored, with the mixing and subsequent \nhomogenisation of water isotope signatures within the headwater dams prior to water \nrelease. The primary cluster of δ2H and δ18O for samples collected along the main river \nchannels are consistent with findings of Hollins et al. (2018) for precipitation signatures, \nwith values fitting closely to the LMWL for Wagga Wagga (δ2H =8.03*δ 18O +14.38). Hollins \net al. (2018) reports annual weighted averages for precipitation of -28.7 ‰ for δ2H and \n−5.36‰ for δ18O for Wagga Wagga from 2003 to 2014, a period encompassing both the \nMillennial Drought (2001-2009) and major floods that occurred in 2010 (Glenn et al. 2017).  \n \nD-excess values of samples collected from the Murrumbidgee River are much higher \n(average of 9.78 ‰) than those from irrigation areas (average of -1.39 ‰). High d-excess \nvalues for river samples represents precipitation sources at the headwaters of the \ncatchment (Hollins et al. 2018; Meredith et al. 2009).  \n \nWithin the primary cluster (Figure 11B), there are smaller δ2H and δ18O clusters for samples \nwithin and between seasons, providing evidence for seasonal influence on water quality. \nThis apparent seasonal influence may be confounded by river regulation, which is controlled \n30 \n \nby annual cropping cycles (O’Gorman, 2013; CSIRO, 2008). Conversely, there is some spread \nof isotope signatures for samples collected in winter 2019.  It is unlikely that the greater \nvariation of isotope values can be attributed to high rainfall and subsequent runoff \ndegrading water quality, as average monthly rainfall for winter 2019 was 28.5 mm at \nTarcutta Post Office (Station 72042). This is significantly less than the average monthly \nrainfall of 59.6 mm for winter across all years (1872 - 2019) and would not cause significant \nrunoff. These findings contradict the CSIRO (2008) report, which conclude that runoff is \nhighest in winter and spring. This may be true for periods of high rainfall, however these \nfindings must be distinguished from drought periods in future water management reports.  \n \nThe greater variation of δ2H and δ18O signatures for samples collected in winter 2019 \nindicates less altered streamflow conditions. Evidence for this is shown by the deviation of \nδ2H and δ18O to the right of the LMWL following a regional evaporation line (Figures 11A & \n11B) (Hollins et al. 2018). The linear evaporation trend may be the result of greater \nresidence times of water in river channels and water storages due to reduced irrigation and \nwater abstraction occurring in winter months (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019). This \nevaporation trend needs to be investigated by future studies that span across multiple \nwinter seasons and quantify evaporation losses to accurately assess the impact of \nevaporation (Skrzypek et al. 2015).  \n \nA weak climatic influence is shown by the higher δ2H and δ18O signatures for samples \ncollected in spring 2018 and 2019 (fitting to the left of the GMWL) relative to lower isotope \nvalues for samples collected in summer which fall below the GMWL to the right (Figure \n11B).  Hollins et al. (2018) supports this finding, reporting a weak seasonal variation in \nisotopic composition with maximum isotopic values recorded in spring and lower values in \nwinter and summer. This variation associated with wet periods associated with tropical \ncyclones and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (Hollins et al. 2018).  \n \n5.2. Potential changes of surface water quality along the flow path  \nEC was generally low (<200 μS/cm) for all sample locations along the Murrumbidgee River. \nThis suggests that activities from adjacent land use, such as the MIA or towns such as Wagga \nWagga, had little to no impact on water quality in the main river system. This is expected as \n31 \n \nthe study was performed during an intense drought period, with low rainfall reducing the \neffect of surface water runoff (Meredith et al. 2009).  \n \nHomogenous EC, δ2H and δ18O values show little to no inputs from surface water runoff or \ngroundwater infiltration for samples collected from the Murrumbidgee River (Figure 8 and \n11B) (Meredith et al. 2009). Unlike the findings of my research, variable δ2H and δ18O \nsignatures were reported by Meredith et al. (2009) for river water collected in the Barwon-\nDarling Catchment of the Murray-Darling Basin during the Millennial Drought (2002-2007). \nMeredith et al. (2009) utilised Cl− concentrations, δ18O and d-excess values of samples to \ncalculate groundwater influx into the Darling River, finding that water comprised of \napproximately 60-99% of saline groundwater during periods of low flow. Meredith et al. \n(2009) concluded that the reduced water levels in the river during the drought conditions \nprovided a pathway for saline groundwater to discharge into the river system.   \n \nThere is notable degradation of water quality once it is diverted from the Murrumbidgee \nRiver into the MIA and CIA (Figure 8). The high EC values (average of 512.2 μS/cm), high \ntemperatures (median of 22.1°C) and low DO concentrations (median of 69%) are consistent \nwith NSW state reports on water quality (DPIE, 2019).  These poor water quality conditions \nare likely the result of shallow, low-flow conditions from water regulation by dams, weirs \nand diversions (Kopf et al. 2019). Poor water quality can result in stratification and \nsubsequent hypoxia of waterbodies, degrading important riverine habitats such as the \nFivebough and Tuckerbil Wetlands (sample location 8 and 15; Figure 3) (Kopf et al. 2019; \nBaldwin, 2019; DPIE, 2020b). There is no risk of poor quality irrigation wastewater being \ndischarged into the Murrumbidgee River, as water terminates at Barren Box Swamp \n(approximately 40 km away from the Murrumbidgee River, Figure 3) (Murrumbidgee \nIrrigation, 2019).  \n \nThe Murrumbidgee River and the irrigation districts can be distinguished by the relative \ndepletion and enrichment of their isotopic signatures, respectively (Figure 11A). The \ndepleted δ2H and δ18O values for samples collected from the main river fit closely to the \nLMWL and are clustered together, reflecting sources of precipitation (Hollins et al. 2018). \nConversely, enriched stable water isotope ratios indicate a strong effect of evaporation for \n32 \n \nsample locations of the MIA and CIA. This evaporation trend is shown by the linear deviation \nfrom the GMWL and LMWL (with a gradient of 5.46) (Figure 11A). There is some seasonal \ninfluence on evaporation trends, with δ2H and δ18O values of samples collected in summer \nfollowing a linear deviation to the right of the LMWL. Conversely, the clustering of δ2H and \nδ18Ovalues for samples collected in winter and spring shows little to no influence of \nevaporation (Figure 11B). \n \nInterestingly, the highest EC values recorded in the Murrumbidgee river and its tributaries \nwere at the upstream location near Gundagai at Sample Location 1 (Figure 7). This may be \nthe result of a combination of factors. There is a sewerage treatment plant at Gundagai, \nwith effluent from the facility being recycled onto the Gundagai Golf Course and the \nneighbouring football oval (Cootamundra-Gundagai Regional Council, 2017). Higher EC may \nbe the result of surface water runoff from these areas. Alternatively, relatively high EC \nvalues recorded at Gundagai (sample location 1) may be the result of salinity impacted areas \ntransferring a higher solute load to the Yass River and subsequently increasing EC within \nBurrinjuck Dam (Jolly et al. 2001). Downstream dilution may then occur with freshwater \ninputs from the Snowy Mountains via Tumut River. Evidence for this is provided by relatively \nhigh EC values recorded at Burrinjuck Dam (Station 410008), with a mean daily EC value of \n238.5 μS/cm recorded over the dates of sampling.  \n \nThe sample size of this study was too small (n<6) to evaluate the relationship between \nwater quality parameters (EC, temperature and DO) and discharge over the study period. \nHowever, EC results of my research provide evidence for the quality of long-term water \nquality datasets at select gauging stations (Table 2, Appendix B). The cross-analysis of \npublicly available EC and streamflow data (June 2018 – February 2020) suggests an inverse \nrelationship between EC and streamflow at Gundagai and Wagga Wagga (Figures 9A & 9B). \nThus, discharge events may decrease EC through dilution in the study area. However, there \nare many complex interactions between electrical conductivity and discharge (Aubert et al. \n2013; Lloyd et al. 2016). This link needs to be further investigated using other tracers such \nas anions or cations, specifically during periods of drought when runoff is minimal. For \nexample, Cartwright et al. (2019) investigated the relationship between streamflow and \nsolutes (Ca, Na, K and Mg) in five headwater streams in the Yarra Catchment of Victoria \n33 \n \nfrom south-eastern Australia. Cartwright et al. (2019) found that some solutes (Ca, Na, K and \nMg) do not change with streamflow, however others (NO3 and SO4) were higher in periods \nof high streamflow. Therefore, more detailed analytical techniques would be required to \ndetermine the relationship between streamflow and EC.  \n \nSamples taken in summer 2020 showed the greatest variation of stable water isotope ratios. \nThis is because the number of sample locations increased to include locations within \nirrigation districts, to explore the impacts of agricultural activities on water quality in the \ncatchment. The water stable isotope signature for sample location 20 (Barren black box-\nwestern pond) has the most enriched δ2H and δ18O value (55.01 ‰ for δ2H and 12.87 ‰ for \nδ18O), suggesting that the sample has been heavily affected by evaporation (Meredith et al. \n2012). Similarly, sample locations 21 (water disposal site) and sample location 10 (Barren \nBlack Box, north-east pond) have been affected by high evaporation. These locations are \ngreatly disconnected from high order Murrumbidgee River and Main Canal systems, only \nreceiving intermittent flows (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019).  \n \n5.3. Implications for river management  \nThe sources and sinks of streamflow have substantial implications for the management of \nwater. Discharge quantities were high in spring and summer months (Figure 6A), with \naverages of 5154.2 ML/day for spring and 6273.2 ML/day for summer from 2018 – 2020 \n(Station 410004 in Gundagai). Water losses were also high, with a 61% decrease in discharge \nrecorded from Gundagai to Carrathool Bridge after a dam release event in August 2018 \n(Figure 6B). These substantial losses are attributed to water abstraction or diversion for \nirrigation (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, 2019). To mitigate associated environmental impacts, \nthe release of environmental water should coincide with water orders placed for \nconsumption by irrigators. This would reduce the proportion of water lost and maintain \nhigher flows downstream (Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, 2019).  \n \nChanges in surface quality across the system from rivers to irrigation areas have important \nimplications for future water management strategies. Water quality was high for samples \ncollected from the Murrumbidgee River, from Gundagai to Hay (September 2018 to \nFebruary 2020). However, high quantities of poor-quality wastewater were discharged to \n34 \n \nterminal lakes and lagoons (Barren Box Wetlands, Figure 3) (Murrumbidgee Irrigation, \n2019). The potential for the reuse or treatment of this water should be investigated, \nparticularly with projected climate change increasing the intensity and frequency of future \ndroughts (OEH, 2018; Dryer et al. 2014; Grafton et al. 2014).  \n \nThe NSW Government has a responsibility to protect wetlands of the Murrumbidgee \nCatchment that support threatened species listed under the Commonwealth Environment \nProtection and Biodiversity Act 2016. This can only be achieved by the improvement of \nwater management practices. The timing and quantity of current environmental water \nreleases is insufficient to restore and maintain threatened fish, waterbird and vegetation \npopulations of the Murrumbidgee Wetlands (Kingsford & Thomas, 2004). Commonwealth \nEnvironmental Water Holdings (i.e. the quantity of water allocated to environmental water \nreleases) are greater during wet and normal conditions (average of 30,321 ML from 2010 – \n2017; Figure 4B) in comparison to drought periods (average of 3,286 ML from 2017 – 2020, \nFigure 4B). However, the largest ecological impacts of poor water quality occur during \ndroughts (Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, 2020b.; Mosley, 2015). \nFor example, the environmental flows of 2018 to 2019 were unable to prevent the mass fish \nkill event at Redbank Weir in January 2019 (Balranald Shire Council, 2019).  \n \nThe ineffective and variable annual delivery of environmental water is seen throughout \nrivers of the Murray-Darling Basin, including the Murray and Lachlan River systems \n(Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, 2020b.).  For the improvement of \nwater management practices, the climatic variability of dry-land river systems needs to be \nconsidered within Water Sharing Plans (Kingsford & Thomas, 2004). Effective water \nmanagement can be achieved by the redistribution of environmental water allocations, with \nlarge quantities of water stored during normal and wet conditions ‘carried over’ to drought \nperiods (Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, 2019). This may prevent future fish \nkills and the degradation of Murrumbidgee Wetlands by minimising periods of low \nstreamflow (Balranald Shire Council, 2019). \n \nTo minimise periods of poor water quality in the Murrumbidgee Catchment and the wider \nMurray-Darling Basin during extended droughts, water allocations and delivery decisions \n35 \n \nmade during non-drought years needs to be improved. This must be achieved with the \nobjective to prolong the availability of consumptive water and environmental flows during \ndroughts. Future water resource management strategies will need to balance the needs of \nall stakeholders, including those of farmers, irrigators, local communities and the \nenvironmental (wetland habitats and ecological communities). The improvement of water \nresource management is increasingly important in the context of projected future climate \nchange and subsequent low streamflow conditions of Australian river systems (Adamson et \nal. 2009).   \n \n6. Conclusion  \nThe examination of water quality results and water isotope signatures of this study, coupled \nwith streamflow data analysis, has allowed for the influences on surface water quality in the \nLower Murrumbidgee Catchment to be evaluated.  The greatest observed impact to water \nquality along the Murrumbidgee River during the study period (September 2018 - February \n2020), a period of drought, is attributed to river regulation and the timing of dam water \nreleases.  \n \nStreamflow in the study area is heavily altered, with river regulation changing the natural \nwinter and summer flow dynamics. Streamflow instead reflects the water demands of the \nirrigation industry, with a large proportion of flows diverted for irrigation of rice and \nperennial crops such as grapes, fruit and nut trees. Evidence for this is given by the \nhomogenous values of water quality parameters and stable water isotopes for samples \ncollected from the main river channel. Streamflow results demonstrate that water is rapidly \ntransferred through the Murrumbidgee River channel, from its release at headwater dams \nto be taken up by irrigators in the MIA and CIA. \nHigh quality water of the Murrumbidgee River was characterised by low EC, high DO \nconcentrations and low temperatures, demonstrating that runoff from irrigation areas has \nno impact on river water quality during periods of drought. There is notable degradation in \nthe quality of water once it is diverted from the Murrumbidgee River into the MIA and CIA, \nattributed to the disposal of wastewater from irrigation. \n36 \n \nMy research offers valuable insight into prevailing hydrological conditions during droughts \nin highly regulated river systems of the Murray-Darling Basin. Our findings provide guidance \nto government water resource strategies, that need to be updated to account for variable \nstreamflow conditions of semi-arid Australian river systems. The reduction of environmental \nwater allocations is required during wetter and normal periods to prolong water availability \nduring droughts. This will increase water security for important community and ecological \nstakeholders. These findings are increasingly important in the context of projected climate \nchange, which will increase the severity of droughts and prolong periods of low streamflow. \n \n7.

In assessing the workers compensation data, there\nis a relatively consistent pattern of mechanisms\ninvolving either being hit by moving objects, body\nstressing (manual handling etc.), vehicles, plus falls, trips\nand slips across sectors. \nWhen matched alongside the agency of injury, there is\nsome evidence of variation with cropping sectors (grain,\ncotton, fodder), more likely to have mobile plant as the\nleading agency, while the large animal sectors (beef,\ndairy, horses, pork, sheep), were more likely to involve\nanimal, human or biological agencies.  \nMeanwhile the fishery and poultry (eggs & meat) sectors,\nclearly had non-powered hand tools as an elevated risk.\nThe shearing sector was the only one with an enhanced\nrisk for fixed plant (noting that fixed plant was also one\nof the nine common fatal hazards across all sectors). \nFurther, there were additional hazards that were\nidentified as being present in at least 75% (n=9-11) of the\nsectors involved in the project, including. trees (nine\nsectors - 6 deaths); and, silos (ten sectors - 3 deaths).\nSummary\nThis report clearly identifies the hazards and risks with\npotentially fatal outcomes and/or serious injury\nconsequences that are common in the participating\nsectors. Of the 34 hazards identified, 24 of these were\npresent across at least 75% (nine) sectors.\nThis provides an opportunity for co-investment to\naddress relevant identified risks. The report also informs\nRSHA Partners of the sector-specific priorities for their\nrespective WHS impact and can guide individual\nproducers to focus on priority hazards and risks.\nThe persistent human cost of death, injury and ill health\nin agriculture and fishing is significant. The economic\nburden of this is conservatively estimated\nat $840 million (2014-2019).\nRecommendations\nThe following recommendations are in accordance with\nthe RSHA objective of using evidence-based information\nto make targeted collaborative\nRD&E investment decisions, where investment can have\nboth human and economic impact.\nRecommendation 1: Initiate a cross-sectoral\nimplementation program addressing five key risks.\nFatalities - from mobile plant, vehicles and electrical\nhazards: Serious Injury - from manual handling,\nalong with slips, trips and falls.\nRecommendation 2: Maintain a watching brief on Mental\nHealth and Wellbeing initiatives and seek suitable\npartnership arrangements where feasible\nRecommendation 3: Establish an expert panel to assist\nwith the provision of advice on future Work Health &\nSafety technology developments.\nRecommendation 4: Initiate a program of work to assess\nand reduce the negative impacts of fatigue on WHS in\nthe agriculture and fisheries sectors\nThe Rural Safety and Health Alliance is a cross-sectoral collaboration\ncomprising nine Rural Research and Development Corporations:\nAgriFutures Australia, Australian Eggs, Australian Pork Limited, Australian\nWool Innovation, Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Dairy\nAustralia, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grains\nResearch and Development Corporation, and Meat and Livestock Australia.  \nIdentifying and prioritising work health & safety overlaps across theagriculture and fisheries sectors\nStay up to date at\nwww.rsha.com.au", "meta": {"filename": "6fb9b284d5dd_RIRDC1901_RSHA03_2020_WHS_Overlaps_Summary.pdf", "path": "data/raw/6fb9b284d5dd_RIRDC1901_RSHA03_2020_WHS_Overlaps_Summary.pdf", "size_bytes": "6258831", "mtime": "2025-08-22T17:52:08.669349", "source_url": "https://www.insidecotton.com/sites/default/files/article-files/RIRDC1901_RSHA03_2020_WHS_Overlaps_Summary.pdf", "source_page": "https://www.insidecotton.com/categories/2020-final-reports", "title": "RSHA03 Identifying and prioritising WHS overlaps across the Agriculture and Fisheries SectorsLowor, Tony, Peachey, Kerri-Lynn (Ag Health Australia, 2020-09)", "year": "2020"}}

Outline the background to the project. \nWater prices in 2019 rose to above $600/Ml and many growers were short of water due to the hot, dry summer.  \nMany growers asked whether it was worth buying water and what the ‘cost’ in yield and quality would be.  A \nsimilar project was carried out in 2018-19 out by Steve Buster (Summit Ag/RivCott Ltd) on four farms and found \nno value in the last irrigation being applied mid-March.  This project would provide further data for growers to \nmake informed decisions on the marginal utility of the last irrigation. \n \nObjectives  \n2. List the project objectives (from the application) and the extent to which \nthese have been achieved. \nFarmers and consultants will be able to make informed decisions on the value of the last irrigations and thus \nimprove resource allocation and profitability. This includes looking at the implications of buying the water as well \n\n  2 of 6 \nas the follow through effects on fibre quality. The aim will be to produce a short report and financial case study \nfor growers. The work that we have been able to replicate this year has helped to build on the case from last \nyear and although we had significant rain events that compounded the results that were collected, the evidence \nthat was collected helped to reinforce the results that were received last year. \n \n \nMethods  \n3. Detail the methodology and justify the methodology used.

The plan was to replicate the similar scenario to the previous season, but with only 3 \nmain timings. 2 replicates where applied this year where possible to try and collect a larger data set for more in-\ndepth analysis.

For the period of the 3rd-5th of March \nrainfall totals shown below: \n\n  3 of 6 \n \nGraph 1: Rainfall from the most significant event that impacted the mid-February final irrigation event.  \nEach of the plots were picked individually with a commercial picker, avoiding areas like tail drains where water \nbacked up where possible. Plant heights, nodes and NAWF were collected at commencement, but as this did not \ninfluence the trial were omitted from this report.  \nThe rounds were weighed with a hand sample of lint taken from each round which were then hand ginned by \nKieran O’Keeffe (CottonInfo) thanks to the DPI and then classed by ProClass Griffith on a HVI™ (High Volume \nInstrument) 1000 instrument.  The sites in general had similar final irrigation dates, excluding site 4 which was \nan earlier crop. Due to the cool finish and issues with micronaire the decision was made to take a deeper dive \ninto how this trial effected the quality of the lint produced.  \n Treatment  \nTurnout \n% \nYield \n(bales/ha) \nYield % of fully \nIrrigated  Micronaire \nMicronaire \nGrade \nEstimated \nDiscount \nSite 1 -3 47.9 8.86 82 3.40 G4 57.14 \n  -2 47.2 10.15 94 3.51 G5 0.00 \n  -1 47.9 11.03 102 3.46 G5 0.00 \n  Grower \nStandard  46.4 10.84 100 \n3.60 G5 0.00 \nSite 2 -1 46.8 6.31 99 2.99 G3 88.00 \n  Grower \nStandard  45.9 6.39 100 \n2.98 G3 88.00 \nSite 3 -2 45.45 9.42 103 2.88 G3 88.00 \n  -1 43.7 8.81 96 2.95 G3 88.00 \n  Grower \nStandard  44.2 9.18 100 \n2.95 G3 88.00 \nSite 4 -2 46.6 12.33 89 3.55 G5 0.00 \n  -1 46.4 13.83 100 3.41 G4 57.14 \n  Grower \nStandard  46.6  13 100 \n3.23 G3 88.00 \nSite 5 -2 43.9 9.52 104 3.19 G3 88.00 \n  -1 44.0 10.48 115 3.08 G3 88.00 \n  Grower \nStandard  44.0 9.13 100 \n2.90 G2 109.42 \nTable 3: Study Summary \nThe overall yields of most fields were below average due to lower than average day degrees accumulated for the \nseason. With such a mild finish and some significant rain events the crops were not pushed in terms of their end \nof season water use which saw only small variations in yield. In some fields there was actually a slightly inverse \ntrend of yield to irrigations.  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nSite 1 Site 2 Site 3 Site 4 Site 5\nRainfall (mm)\nMarch 3-5 Rainfall Totals (mm)\nSeries1\n  4 of 6 \n \nGraph 2: Site yields overlayed with the percentage of the fully irrigated.  \nIt can be seen from the data above that the yields were a bit all over the place likely due to rain events that were \nlarge enough to supplement some of the shortfalls in irrigations.  \nThe data was collated and analysed.

This is an interesting trend that could be hypothesised to be related to geographic area, \nas they are both the more eastern areas, and could indicate that later irrigation encouraged more late fruit set or \ngot waterlogged due to irrigations and then significant rain events. The true cause is difficult to determine \nexactly but luxurious water coupled with below average day degree accumulation does appear to have a \nnegative impact on crop micronaire.  \nSeason   Day degrees accumulated \n19/20 12th Feb DD accumulated  880.2 \n18/19 13th Feb DD accumulated  1005.15 \n12.5% less heat from Oct 1st to 12th Feb \n    \n19/20 Day Degrees Accumulated 12th Feb - 30th April  318.65 \n18/19 Day Degrees Accumulated 12th Feb - 30th April  492.25 \n35% Less heat from previous year to finish crop \n    \n19/20 Day Degrees Accumulated LEF to 1st pass 12th April 300.2 \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n120%\n140%\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n14.00\n16.00\nMid Feb Early March Mid March\nYield (b/ha)\nFinal Yields (b/ha)\nSite 1 Site 2 Site 3 Site 4 Site 5\nSite 1 Site 2 Site 3 Site 4 Site 5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n-3 -2 -1 GS\nMicronaire\nMicronaire VS Grade\nSite 1 Site 2 Site 3 Site 4 Site 5 G1 G2 G3 G4 G5A\n  5 of 6 \n18/19 Day Degrees Accumulated LEF to 1st pass 15th April 432.3 \n31% Less heat from LEF to 1st pass defoliation \nTable 4: Day Degree Accumulation  \nIt can be seen from the information above that the biggest factor effecting the lower micronaire was the lower \namounts of day degrees accumulated, it is interesting to see that in the more Eastern blocks increased irrigations \ncompounded on this and resulted in even further reduced micronaire.  \nThere were no other trends from the quality results in terms of strength and length.  \n \nPhoto: Site 1 modules post picking showing variations in lint picked off plots of the same size.

Describe the planned outcomes achieved \nto date. \nThe outputs from this project is some further great data for growers in the southern \nvalleys, and beyond, to use to make decisions on the final Irrigation value in their \nproduction systems. We have also managed to inadvertently do some work on \nmicronaire as well as the data collected has provided some great resources around \nthat which was a big issue this year.  \nEconomically, it provides growers with even further evidence that in most years \nthere is little to no benefit in a mid-September irrigation with that water likely used \nfor other crops, as well as there being an inverse relationship this year between \nhigher rainfall areas and the quality when watered later.  \nEnvironmentally the results reflect above with evidence suggesting most growers in \nmost years can reduce their water Input but 0.8megs/ha.  \nThe social benefits follow the same lines, with further evidence to the wider \ncommunity that farmers are implementing sciences to make decisions and improve \ntheir production systems.  \n \n \n5.

Provide an assessment of the likely impact of the results and conclusions of the \nresearch project for the cotton industry.  What are the take home messages?  \n• The return on investment of the final irrigation in the 2019/2020 season was \nan interesting study that was ultimately impacted by rain with the more \n\n  6 of 6 \nEastern sites showing no significant differences in yield. The key take home \nmessages from the second year of this trial are: \n• That the cut out of irrigations in early February is yield limiting, even in a \ncooler wetter finish, with the second year of this result supporting the \nfindings from last year.  \n• In climatic conditions that are cooler and trending towards damper there is no \nyield benefit to continuing to irrigate into mid-March, with site 3 and 5 \nhaving a slightly inverse trend of more irrigation resulting in a slightly lower \nyield.  \n• At the two Eastern sites (4 and 5) there was an inverse relationship between \nirrigations and micronaire indicating that final irrigations when coupled with \nsignificant rain events produced poorer quality. Site 4 went from an estimated \n$88/bale discount at grower standard irrigations to no discount when final \nirrigation was at the end of February. \n• At site 1 we saw a 6% yield increase when going from a late Feb to an early \nMarch final irrigation so water at $300/meg, 0.8 megs/ha applied would cost \napproximately $240, the yield increase of 6% on a 10 bale/ha crop assuming \nlint price at $600 would be $360/ha, resulting in a positive return on \ninvestment.  \n• Hindsight is a wonderful thing. \n \nExtension  Opportunities  \n7.

The study contained within this report was originally \nproposed to understand the facilitators and barriers to using technology to \nimprove farming systems in the cotton industry and the impacts of adopting new \ntechnology on workforce skills required and workforce planning in cotton \nbusinesses. Since the beginning of this research, other industry events have \nfocused on the future of Australian agriculture including the National Farmers \nFederation 2030 Round Tables in 2018, and the launch of the inaugural Evoke \nAg event in 2019 which brought new insights to the forefront. While this project \nsought to fulfil its original aims, it was also apparent that other factors \nchallenging and enabling the future adaptation of cotton industry businesses \nwould enrich the research.  \nThis research project has been strengthened by the support and collaborative \nactivities with the attendees of the CRDC Science Forum – Build adaptive \ncapacity of the cotton industry. This 2018 event was a gathering co-ordinated by \nPeople Program research manager, Rachel Holloway and included \nrepresentatives from CRDC, including Ian Taylor, Jane Trindall, and Ruth \nRedfern, other researchers including Gordon Stone, Jeff Coutts, Jana-Axinja \nPaschen, Lynette McLeod, Trudy Staines, Ruth Nettle, Jennifer Moffatt, and \nOliver Knox; Cotton Australia representatives Ali Briggs (Education Co-\nordinator), Rebecca Fing, (Workforce & Training Co-ordinator), Angela Bradburn \n(Policy Officer), Claudia Vicary (Agskilled Project Co-ordinator); Cotton Info \nrepresentative Warwick Waters; myBMP manager Rick Kowitz; and several  \nGrowers including Nuffield Scholars Daniel Kahl and Renee Anderson, Peter \nTuohey, Emma McCullagh, Kate O’Callaghan, and Dave Walton. The opportunity \nto test ideas and learn from the diverse knowledge and perspectives of those \ninterested in cotton industry workforce development has proven invaluable in \naccelerating my understanding of the issues under investigation and guiding this \nresearch.  \nI am very grateful to Rachel Holloway who offered considerable support and \nguidance throughout the project. Cotton Australia and CottonInfo \nrepresentatives, as well as fellow members of the Australian Association of \nCotton Scientists, gave great assistance by connecting me into their networks of \ninnovative growers. I also acknowledge Professor Peter McIlveen’s assistance in \nthe project design and analysis of the data. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 10 \n \n \n \n \nThe case studies contained in this report are in-depth and detailed in describing \nthe adaptive ways that change and strategic workforce management is \napproached in different contexts. This has only been possible due to the \ngenerosity of the growers, managers, agronomists, and workers that have \nshared their knowledge and experiences through the different iterations of this \nproject – I am incredibly grateful to all the participants. While not all individuals’ \naccounts have been captured within the case studies presented, all interviews \nconducted led to a greater understanding of the future of work on cotton farms \nand in this way, all participants have informed the analysis and inferences made. \nOver the course of this research project, the increasing volatility, uncertainty, \ncomplexity, and ambiguity that characterises the world of work was evident in \nthe unprecedented severity of the drought that spread through cotton production \nvalleys. More recently, the industry is bouncing back following substantial \nrainfall, but it is the ‘black swan’ event of an international pandemic and \nconsequent border closures restricting access to seasonal labour that may now \nlimit production. We may not be able to precisely predict our future, but we can \nprepare by improving our ability to proactively adapt to the ever-shifting forces \nthat impact work in the cotton industry. I hope that by sharing the innovative \napproaches to work that are happening within the cotton industry businesses \nprofiled in this report, that others can gain insights into a variety of approaches \nto adapt and strategically develop their businesses and support the people that \npower the industry to grow into new ways of working. By doing this we ensure \nthat collectively, the cotton industry is ready to approach future challenges, \nwhatever they may be, in a way that ensures a sustainable, productive, and \nprofitable industry in the years to come. \n \nNicole McDonald \nResearcher \nMay 2021 \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 11 \n \n \n \n \nExecutive Summary \n\"The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.\" -Malcolm X \n\"The only way you can predict the future is to build it.\" -Alan Kay \nPurpose \nThis project was initially developed in response to the shift in the Australian \nagriculture industry to a new stage of transformation: the rise of digital \nagriculture. Reports on the future of the industry described potential scenarios \nand the current research has attempted to explore what this may mean for the \nworkforce capacity and capability requirements of the Australian cotton industry. \nBuilding capacity in the cotton industry workforce involves equipping people \nto proactively drive change and innovation within the industry and on–farm, \nensuring the Australian cotton industry maintains a competitive advantage in \nthe future. The research presented in this report examines how people at the \nforefront of change are successfully adapting as individuals and as \nbusinesses to survive and thrive into the future and identify what these \nchanges may mean more broadly for the future of work in the cotton \nindustry. \nProject Objectives and Research Aims \nThe objectives of the ‘Understanding and Planning for the Future Cotton Industry \nWorkforce’ project were to undertake research to: \n1. Provide an understanding of ‘drivers of change’ which will impact the \nfuture cotton industry workforce. \n2. Identify the future skills required within industry and on-farm and \nprioritise the skill development areas to facilitate innovative farming \npractices. \n3. Identify strategies to maximise skill development and transference of \nskills to raise employer and employee confidence and capacity in adopting \nfuture advances in cotton farming. \n4. Assist Growers in adoption of new technologies on-farm, including \nworkforce planning while implementing new technology introduction, \ntransition, and maintenance periods. \n5. Provide recommendations for future workforce planning considering \nimpacts of ‘drivers of change’ on industry, growers, and workers. \nThe research aims of ‘Contextualising the Future of Work in the Cotton Industry” \nincluded \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 12 \n \n \n \n \n1. Understand factors influencing technology acceptance and adoption. \n2. Understand grower and workforce experiences of transition that occur \nwith the introduction of technology. \n3. Understand entrepreneurial behaviours and the mindsets, skills and \nstructures that encourage entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship within \ncotton businesses. \n4. Understand the function of the knowledge network and consultants work \nin extending and influencing on-farm change. \n5. Understand influences on attraction, retention, and development of \nworkforce and how this occurs in adaptable businesses. \n6. Identify other factors that may shape the future of work and workforce \nrequirements for the Australian cotton industry. \nResearch Design \nThe overall research design consists of two distinct parts: (a) an analysis of the \n2018 Grower Practices Survey, and (b) a multi-case study of cotton farming and \nallied industry professionals to explore different factors associated with the \nfuture of work. \nAnalysis of the 2018 Grower Practices Survey \nThe Grower Practices Survey is an annual survey of cotton growers that collects \ninformation about the past season crop production and other related issues. The \nquestions are updated each year, keeping the survey as succinct as possible, \nwhile ensuring a wide range of data capture over time. In 2018, the opportunity \nwas provided to researchers within the ‘people’ research stream to capture data \nrelating to the on-farm workforce demographics/structures, attitudes of \nemployers towards workforce and technology adoption relating to automation. \nExpanding on the descriptive analysis presented within the 2018 Grower \nPractices Survey Report, an analysis of this data directly related to the first aim \nof the research project.  \nMulti-Case Study \nThe remainder of the aims are addressed using multi-case research. The \nowners/workforce of adaptable cotton industry businesses clustered around a \nspecific context were treated as single cases. The adapting cotton industry is \nmore broadly considered the target collection to be studied (Stake, 2013). A \npragmatic approach was taken, and these cases are not uniform in the roles that \nparticipants hold or the number or types of perspectives that have been \nincluded. Each has been written to focus on different factors of interest that \nwere generated either from the literature or the data and aligned with the aims \nof the research. In this way, these instrumental case studies are facilitating \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 13 \n \n \n \n \nfurther understanding of the future workforce requirements for the Australian \ncotton industry, the skills and abilities needed to adapt and the structures and \nsystems that attract, develop and retain desirable workers (Stake, 1995).  \nSemi-structured interviews were initially conducted with growers. Depending on \nthe size of the business and research questions that were further generated from \nthe interviews, employees of the enterprise were also invited to participate. The \ninterview schedules used are listed in Appendix A. When selecting participants, \nevery effort was made to include a range of different businesses, larger and \nsmaller enterprises with various levels of staffing, irrigation and dryland \ncropping, and farms in different production valleys. The addition of a case study \non an agronomy consulting business recognises the rise in higher skilled allied \nprofessions and offered a different perspective on practice change in the \nindustry. Existing theory and academic literature have been used in the analysis \nprocess to guide interpretation. Member checks were conducted with all growers \nto ensure the accuracy of the researchers’ interpretation of the transcript data \nand to ensure the ethical standards of research were upheld for participants. \n \nKey Findings \nThe key findings and implications of the research in relation to the research aims \nare summarized in the tables below.\n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 14 \n \n \n \n \nAim 1: Understand factors influencing technology acceptance and adoption. \nFindings Implications \nFactors that moved people from being disengaged regarding technology solutions to considering \ntechnology solutions for their farm business included: \n• Perceived usefulness of automation to save time and solve labour issues (such as the limitations \nexperienced when needing to quickly hire and upskill workers to increase production after \ndrought). \n• Perceived usefulness of technology to solve a production issue that is a strategic priority (if \npriority production issues are not solvable through technology, then grower attention may be \nfocused on practice change other than technology adoption). \n• Dissatisfaction with the status quo and a perception that automation is potentially more efficient \nand effective than current approaches to task performance. \n• An influential person within the business is in a growth stage in their career or the owner’s \nbusiness is in a growth stage. \n• Time and resources allow for effective strategic planning in the business and exploration of digital \nagriculture solutions (growers who have structured their roles to dedicate time and energy to \nstrategic planning are able to pay attention to future opportunities offered by technology use). \nFactors that moved people from considering technology solutions to adoption of technology solutions \nincluded: \n• An economically sound business case tailored to the farming enterprise can be made for adoption. \nNot all technology is economically viable in all farming systems. \n• There is a known pathway to implementation and perceived ease of use for technology, including \naccess to reliable support from providers. \n• Grower/manager is upskilled in digital transformation of the business including implementing \ninfrastructure (connectivity) and collection/management/use of data. \n• Grower/manager has the leadership capability to engage workforce in technology acceptance and \ncoaching of skill development for effective technology use by workforce – effective use is essential \nto realise the economic value of precision technology. \n• Grower/manager trusts that technology will deliver results. There is a reasonable ‘plan B’ that can \nbe utilised if technical issues arise, ensuring that production is not negatively impacted if \ntechnology fails. \n \n• Technology providers must have a strong \nunderstanding of the production issues that matter to \ngrowers and the farming systems that surround these \nissues to develop useful solutions. \n• The threats and opportunities to cotton farm businesses \nthat may be addressed with digital agriculture (e.g., \nfluctuating labour demands, societal trust, resource \nmanagement) must be made clear for growers to factor \ntechnology solutions into strategic planning activities in \npreparation for when cost, reliability and relative \nadvantage in performance makes these viable to adopt. \n• Growers supported to maintain a growth mindset within \ntheir business will be well placed to adapt in their \nbusiness.  \n• Growers benefit from the expertise of others to identify \nthe initial business case for technology adoption. This \nmay mean observing the successful implementation of \ntechnology in different farm business contexts to \nevaluate the business case for themselves (e.g., field \ndays at different growers’ farms using technology) or \naccess to specialist consultants who can advise on the \nbusiness case for their specific farming businesses. \n• Growers skilled in digital transformation processes, \nincluding technical aspects associated with \ninfrastructure implementation, data collection, \nmanagement and use, and leadership/coaching of the \nworkforce through the digital transformation will be \nable to take advantage of the benefits that technology \nadoption offers. \n• Growers require access to skilled service providers to \nfix/maintain digital technology.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 15 \n \n \n \n \n \nAim 2: Understand grower and workforce experiences of transition that occur with the introduction of \ntechnology. \nFindings Implications \n• Personality factors and orientations that were described by people effectively \nengaged in a change process included: an openness to experience, humility, \ncuriosity, and willingness to challenge the status quo. These qualities help people to \napproach change rather than avoid it and to be willing to learn. \n• Growers trialled new technology, making a gradual expansion of new approaches to \ngrowing cotton as the value proposition was established. \n• Ease of use influenced perceived usefulness of technology and leads to acceptance. \n• Barriers to technology acceptance and use were related to physical or cognitive \nissues experienced by some on-farm workforce. \n• A colleague who had experienced benefits in using the technology and could offer \nsupport improved other workers trust that the technology would be useful. This \nencouraged technology acceptance and persistence to learn skills required for use. \n• Transformational leadership practices were important to encourage workforce to \nstay engaged during a change process. \n• Growers/managers skilled understanding of individual differences meant they could \ntailor their support to workers needs and maintain good relationships during a \nchange process. \n• Ensuring that trust was maintained, workers felt valued in interactions with their \nemployer/manager, and psychologically safe at work when digital technology \nincreased transparency of workplace behaviours was important for a positive \nexperience associated with change on-farm. \n• People’s positive experiences with technology use builds confidence, skills, interest \nin and acceptance of digital agriculture. \n \n• Technology needs to be designed for diverse users, including \ndifferent literacy levels or physical abilities. \n• Growers understand the processes to conduct effective trials on-\nfarm and use evidence to understand the value proposition of new \ntechnology for their business. \n• Growers identify a team member to champion new technology use \non-farm and support peers in their adoption. \n• Digital agriculture raises the skill level required of \nmanagers/supervisors in relation to workforce management. \nGrowers/managers/supervisors who are skilled in transformational \nleadership would be effectively able to support workforce through \nchanges to their roles on-farm, including those that involve \ntechnology acceptance. \n• Psychological safety would appear to be important to learning \ncultures but further exploration of this concept in context is required \nto identify any contextual nuances that need to be considered before \ninvesting in upskilling around this concept. \n• The principles of transformational leadership that were identified in \nthe current research project align with the recommendations of \nCoutts & Stone (2019) for additional myBMP HR Level 3 people \nmanagement practices. This strengthens that argument for the \ninclusion of these performance indicators to clarify best performance \npractices that cotton farm businesses require to be innovative and \neffectively manage change with regards to their workforce. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 16 \n \n \n \n \nAim 3: Understand entrepreneurial behaviours and the mindsets, skills and structures that encourage \nentrepreneurship or intrapreneurship within the cotton businesses. \n \nFindings Implications \n• In addition to the personality factors that influence successful engagement in \na change process, factors including a dissatisfaction with the status quo, \nmastery goal orientation, creativity and grit are integral for those who create \nchange through entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship. \n \n• High engagement and ability to think strategically, to identify threats and \nfind opportunities was evident in large cotton businesses and small to \nmedium cotton businesses that were enacting entrepreneurship. \n \n• The ability to communicate with diverse people in agriculture and industries \noutside of agriculture was important to find new economic opportunities. \n• Business owners’ acceptance of the costs associated with the learning curve \n(trial and error) was required for employees to engage in intrapreneurial \nbehaviour. \n \n• Employees were able to argue for the adoption of their ideas through building \na business case to present to growers/owners. \n \n• Mentorship from entrepreneurial growers encouraged the development of the \nentrepreneurship and intrapreneurship skills (communication, strategic \nthinking, developing a business case for new ideas, acceptance of the \nlearning curve costs). \n \n• Entrepreneurial development opportunities from primary \nschool through to adults employed in cotton farm businesses \nwould help to build the pipeline of people attracted to the \nindustry who excel in these endeavors. \n \n• Growers who can redesign their jobs to allow the time and \nenergy to engage in strategic planning and upskill in \nstrategic thinking and foresight can seize opportunities and \nmanage future threats. \n \n• Growers who have developed relationships with those that \nare entrepreneurial are provided with supportive learning \nopportunities to develop their own entrepreneurial skills.  \n \n \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 17 \n \n \n \n \nAim 4: Understand the function of the knowledge network and consultants work in extension and influencing \non-farm change. \nFindings Implications \n• Networks are sources of information and collaboration that enable \ninnovation. \n \n• The strengths of connections and diversity of experiences within the \nnetwork influence innovation potential. \n \n• Diversity within the network requires more skillful communication to \nenhance connections and collaboration. \n \n• The knowledge network needs to flow between researchers to growers, and \ngrowers to researchers. Agronomists provide an important conduit for \ntranslation of knowledge and can offer their own insights to both parties. \n \n• Knowledge shared between networks include technical knowledge (how to \nperform tasks) and career knowledge (how to manage career in the cotton \nindustry). \n \n• It is important to find ways for different members of the cotton industry, \nwhose access to different sources of knowledge may be restricted by \nphysical distance, to form connections that can improve their learning. \n \n• Initiatives to connect networks across production \nvalleys can strengthen knowledge across the industry. \n \n• Agronomists are central to innovation systems and \ntheir knowledge can be valuable for researchers and \ngrowers alike. \n \n• Consider use of digital communication to encourage \ndiverse and collaborative networks across professions \nin the cotton industry. \n \n• Facilitating connection to the knowledge network is \nparticularly important for new entrants who may have a \nlow level of social capital within the industry. Limited \nconnections reduce their access to peer-to-peer \nlearning or to collaborate in ways that benefit the \nindustry. \n \n \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 18 \n \n \n \n \nAim 5: Understand influences on attraction, retention, and development of workforce and how this occurs in \nadaptable businesses. (Development and Retention) \nFindings Implications \nDevelopment and Retention: \n• Growers who are adapting and persisting in the industry are committed to their own professional \ndevelopment and structure the work demands to allow themselves time to work strategically on the \nbusiness. \n \n• To prevent turnover due to burnout, jobs need to be designed with adequate recovery time and individuals \nneed the ability to manage time and energy to balance work and home roles. \n• Cotton growers widely acknowledge the value of their employees, wanting them to feel committed to their \nroles and part of the business.  \n \n• Developing individual employee expertise in an area of farm production means knowledge and skill \nproficiency is distributed amongst the team and the grower/manager is not the only source of on-the-job \nsupport or training for employees on farm. \n \n• Providing a career path with increasing responsibilities for workers who want to develop professionally is \nimportant to retain them in the business. \n \n• Creating an environment where workers can contribute ideas. speak openly about issues at work, and \nreceive tailored guidance, support, and feedback on their performance led to their ability to adapt to \nchanges and work autonomously on-farm. \n \n• Adoption of automation could positively influence retention. It was proposed that a reduction in the \nseasonal workforce and with a greater proportion of the workforce that are unified by shared values and a \ncommitment to their work would lead to a more enjoyable and satisfying workplace.  \n \n• Adoption of automation could negatively influence retention. It was proposed that a reduction in the overall \nagricultural workforce due to automation could mean a reduction in the local community population. This \ncould impact access to essential services (health/education) or social activities (sport) that contribute to the \nlivability of a place. This would make it difficult to retain or attract the skilled employees. \n \n \n• Professional development for growers \nto improve the social sustainability of \ntheir business involves the following \nskills: strategic planning; delegation \nskills; redesigning work roles to \ndistribute knowledge, skills, and \nresponsibility amongst the team; time \nand energy management; people \nmanagement; creating a \npsychologically safe work culture; \nworkforce succession planning and \ncommunication/negotiation/collaborati\non skills. \n \n• Performance reviews, career \nconversations, and providing \nopportunities to develop mastery are \nimportant for employee retention. \n \n• The cotton industry can benefit from \nproactively working with communities \nin cotton growing regions to \nstrategically improve the liveability of \nthese areas. This would reduce the \nrisks that the expansion of automation \ncould negatively impact community \ndemographics and access to services. \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 19 \n \n \n \n \nAim 5: Understand influences on attraction, retention, and development of workforce and how this occurs in \nadaptable businesses. (Attraction) \nFindings Implications \nAttraction: \n• School-Industry partnerships with high school or tertiary institutions, are a strategic \nway to influence the next generation to aspire to a career in the cotton industry. In the \ncurrent study, these were created with schools that have some form of pre-existing \nrelationship with growers. The benefits of this include values congruence between the \nschool context and the farm context. \n \n• Transition programs such as the Cotton Australia gap year program give people with no \nconnection to industry a supported pathway to gain the skills and the networks that lead \nto a professional identity associated with the cotton industry. They also provide an \nopportunity to test out work in unfamiliar locations. \n \n• Mining continues to be a competitor for talent, but the lifestyle offered on farms may \nhold more appeal for workers, particularly if the farm uses digital technology and is \nprogressive, and strong local community connections can be established for the \nemployee. \n \n• Adequate telecommunications are considered an essential service (particularly by the \nnext generation) that is necessary to facilitate standards of living that include digitally \nconnected lives (e.g. social media, streaming entertainment, external education). \nUnreliable access to the internet could be a factor that negatively impacts job and \ncareer choices for the next generation. \n \n \n• The talent pool attracted to careers in cotton could be \nexpanded if school-industry partnerships between cotton \ngrowing businesses and high schools/tertiary institutions \nwere extended beyond pre-existing relationships and \nfacilitated in a strategic way with supports that connect \nstudents to the lifestyle/communities in cotton production \nvalleys.  \n \n• Transition programs could improve attraction to the \nindustry if they target the points of high school to work; \nundergraduate studies to work and postgraduate studies \nto work. \n \n• The different seasonal peaks of the Northern and Southern \nregions provide the opportunity to design a graduate \nprogram that rotates agricultural science graduates to new \nareas where they may be supported to try different work \nin the cotton industry. \n \n• Ensuring digital connectivity of farming businesses is \nimportant for employee lifestyle factors that could impact \ntheir satisfaction when working remotely. Perceptions of \nlifestyle affect attraction to the cotton industry. \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 20 \n \n \n \n \nAim 6: Identify other factors that may shape the future of work and workforce requirements for the Australian \ncotton industry. \nFindings Implications \nData Collection, Management and Use: \n• The task-demand of effective data collection, management and use is potentially creating a new \nrole for farm businesses. Professions with transferable skills (e.g. book keepers) may be upskilled \nto offer these services.  \n• At the moment the economic return on investment for creating a paid position to perform these \ntasks is not evident to many in the industry. Some participants expressed that there was little \nrelative advantage when changing current practices given the production priorities of the \nbusiness. \n \nTransparency: \n• There is a rise in consumer desire for transparency with regards to Australian agriculture. \n• Cotton growers engaging in best practice management can confidently provide transparency but \nto build trust these narratives need to be supported with data. \n• Growers who are able to validate their good environmental practices with data may be able to \nextract premiums for their products or generate alternative revenue streams from stewardship \nprograms. \n \nSocial Licence: \n• The narratives that accompany data that validates good practice need to be communicated in \nways that make sense to the consumer to effectively build trust, e.g. discussing the amount of \nwater used per bale of cotton means nothing to people without a frame of reference to \ncomprehend this information. \n• Skilled communication that connects diverse stakeholders, and the wider community, to credible \ninformation about the cotton industry and establishes shared values may be particularly important \nfor further establishing the cotton industry in areas of Northern Australia. \n \n• Digital transformation of businesses and \nestablishing effective data collection, \nmanagement, and use is needed now to ensure \ncotton farm businesses are well placed to take \nadvantage of opportunities that will rely on \nvalidation of their farm management practices. \n \n• The combination of data to validate claims, \ngood communicators and transparency are \ncentral to the social licence and future of the \ncotton industry, and the people who work in it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 21 \n \n \nRecommendations \nFrom the current research the following series of recommendations are made for \n(a) collaborative activities (b) mentoring to develop knowledge, skills, and \ncollaboration, (c) skill development activities, (d) adoption of best management \npractices for innovative people capability performance standards, and (e) future \nresearch, development, and extension activities. \nCollaborative Activities \n• Industry provides opportunities for agtech companies to connect with a \ndiverse range of cotton growers and their employees during the \ndevelopment phase of products to improve the usability of technology and \nexplore the value proposition of adoption across different contexts. \n• Industry field days and tours focused on implementation and use of \ntechnology solutions are complemented with video case studies or zoom \nmeeting debrief/recaps that allow wider dissemination of knowledge \ndiscussed at these events. \nMentoring to Develop Knowledge, Skills and Collaboration \n• Growers are supported to develop their entrepreneurial skills and strategic \nthinking with a mentoring process from other experienced entrepreneurial \ngrowers. \n• A mentoring program across roles (e.g. grower-researcher relationship, \nagronomist-grower, researcher-agronomist) supports collaborations that \nbenefit innovation as these cross-profession relationships facilitate \ndifferent perspectives of challenges or problems that the industry faces. \nSkills Development Activities \nUpskilling opportunities are required in the following areas: \n• Digital transformation processes, including technical aspects associated \nwith infrastructure implementation, data collection, management and use, \nand soft skills aspects associated with leadership/coaching of the \nworkforce through the digital transformation. \n• Trial design, implementation, and analysis of results to determine whether \ninitial use of technology or innovative practices should be upscaled within \nthe enterprise. \n• Transformational and Entrepreneurial leadership to develop innovative \ncotton businesses and the workforce capacity required for innovation on-\nfarm. \n• Social Sustainability development skills including: strategic planning; \ndelegation skills such as redesigning work roles to distribute knowledge, \nskills and responsibility amongst the team; time and energy management; \npeople management; creating a learning culture; and \ncommunication/negotiation/collaboration skills. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 22 \n \nAdoption of Best Management Practice for Innovative People Capability \nPerformance Standards \n \nThe evidence from the current project strengthens the recommendations of \nCoutts & Stone (2019) for additional myBMP HR Level 3 people management \npractices to be adopted. These are detailed within the Towards an Innovative \nCotton Workforce report as: \nEmployees are viewed as key contributors to decision-making and planning in \nthe farming system and a process is in place to include them in line with their \nroles and experience.  \nChecklist  \no Managers provide an overview of the farm enterprise to new employees \nwhich includes the ‘vision’ for the farm in the future;  \no Staff have a clear understanding of their roles and that of other employees \nas well as clarifying where there is scope for proactive input;  \no Managers provide a regular update on issues, opportunities and decisions \nneeded in relation to farm operations;  \no A system is in place for regular discussion and feedback from staff;  \no Experienced staff are offered opportunity to comment on consultant \nrecommendations in line with their understanding of specific farm/paddock \nneeds.  \n \nOwners/managers have the training and/or acquired skills in leadership and \n(‘higher-level’) personnel management to ensure that staff are efficiently and \neffectively deployed, clearly understand their roles, are provided with the \nnecessary skills and support to feel valued and rewarded.  \n \nChecklist  \no Managers undertake professional development in higher level personnel \nmanagement skills and/or have competence in these skills through \nexperience and practice;  \no There is a personnel plan in place for the farm specific to the current staff \nwhich shows their roles, experience and responsibilities;  \no There is a mentoring system in place where new staff are formally linked \nwith a more experienced staff member and/or the manager to guide \ncapacity development and contribution to the farm;  \no A reward system is in place which acknowledges those staff who \ncontribute positively to the farm.  \n \nThe Owner/Manager uses a set of personnel performance metrics to gauge \nimprovements over time and, where possible, where the farm fits within industry \nperformance.  \n \nChecklist  \no Farms have a list of monitoring/evaluation metrics for this purpose \n[included in this report] and collect data against these metrics;  \no The metrics are reviewed annually to measure changes/trends and inform \nfuture personnel management planning.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 23 \n \n \nFarm owners have the strategic business skills required to be able to react and \nadapt in a changing and challenging market and climatic environment.  \n \nFuture Research, Development and Extension Activities \n• The industry invests in understanding attraction, development, and \nretention of the skilled workforce required to install, fix, and maintain \ndigital technology including the skills transitions that may be required of \nmechanical tradespeople. \n• The processes for establishing effective School-Industry partnerships are \ndeveloped, documented, and widely disseminated to cotton industry \nbusinesses. This includes connecting with Trudy Staines (CSIRO) and \nJenny Hughes (Cotton Australia) depending on the student cohort \n(primary/secondary school or tertiary institution) and a brief self-paced \ntraining session on facilitating effective career education experiences. \n• Transition programs are designed to provide career development, \nconnection to local communities, and the work opportunity structures that \nassist with aspiring to work in the cotton industry at the points of (a) high \nschool to work, (b) undergraduate study to work, and (c) postgraduate \nstudy to work. \n• A specific grad-gap (an agriculture science graduate program) is designed \nto rotate promising students through a range of careers (policy, research, \nagronomy etc.) and different production valleys including Northern \nAustralia. \n• Further research is conducted on the concept of psychological safety, \ntesting the robustness of this concept for establishing a learning \nenvironment on farm and identifying any context-specific limitations that \ncould impact the usefulness of such an approach on-farm. \n• The industry invests in a program of resources and training to support \nbest management practice for innovative cotton businesses to manage the \nfuture workforce skills and capabilities identified in the current project. \nInvestigation into strategies for the successful integration of these \nresources into on-the-job skills development for owners through to entry \nlevel employees is required. \n• Systems to assist growers and employees to strategically plan, execute, \nand validate employee personal and professional development activities \n(e.g. skills passport systems) are investigated for the value they may \nprovide in (a) growing workforce capability across the industry, (b) \nintroducing micro-credentials that may be updated as future skill needs \nchange, and (c) creating visible pathways for career progression. \nIn summary, this project sought to explore the process of change as occurring in \ninnovative cotton industry businesses and to identify the workforce skills, \nstructures, and processes that help businesses adapt, survive, and thrive into the \nfuture. The in-depth case studies provide examples of best practice and identify \nissues that may prove challenging as megatrends such as climate change, the \nrise of digital technologies, changing demographics, and transparency and trust, \nshape the future of work in the cotton industry. These case studies also provide \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 24 \n \ninsight into a range of strategies that different types of businesses are employing \nto manage risk and approach threats to find opportunities for economic growth. \nThe next steps are to take the knowledge generated from this project and create \na pathway and implementation program that results in the integration of best \npractice to manage future workforce skills into cotton industry businesses. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 25 \n \nChapter One: Introduction \nGlobal trends such as (a) rapid urbanisation, (b) climate change and resource \nscarcity, (c) shift in global economic power, (d) demographic and social change, \nand (e) technological breakthroughs are shaping the future of work across all \ncontexts (Price Waterhouse Cooper, 2017). More recently, the global pandemic of \nCOVID-19 has disrupted the world of work with essential services such as \nagriculture experiencing the effects of disrupted supply chains and restricted \naccess to seasonal workforce through border closures. Indeed, the world of \nagricultural work continues to face new and ongoing challenges that impact the \nworkforce requirements for the future productivity of the Australian cotton \nindustry. The volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of the future of \nwork has led to increased interest in understanding how individuals  can plan and \nbe prepared with the skills and abilities required to successfully navigate the \nchanging context. Furthermore, with expectations of the continuance of a “fourth \nindustrial revolution” and the rise of digital agriculture (RIRDC, 2016), the cotton \nindustry must develop a deeper understanding of how to strategically unlock the \ncapability of people to drive this change. It is essential to identify the types of \nworkers, skills, and workforce structures that will ensure cotton farm businesses \nare adaptable and benefit from the opportunities for improved productivity, \nefficiency, and sustainability that technology promises.  \nThis project involved two studies. In the first study, the research for \nUnderstanding and planning for the future cotton industry workforce identified \ndrivers of the next generation’s career choices and influences on their skills \ndevelopment. It described a range of adaptability skills and technical skills that \nhelp these individuals transitioning to new work to succeed and thrive within the \ncotton industry. In this second study, the research aims to explore drivers of \nchange at the industry and farm/agribusiness level to better understand the \nadaptability of organisations. Several relevant national reports that discuss the \nfuture of work are reviewed to identify areas where deeper context-specific \nknowledge may illuminate factors influencing the future of work for the \nAustralian cotton industry. Furthermore, the academic literature regarding the \nsocial implications of digital agriculture, and theories relating to technology \nadoption and acceptance are used to inform the research. \nThe Future of Work \nThere is an extensive body of work that exists in the form of industry and \nconsultant reports that aims to identify potential futures, factors influencing \npotential futures, and strategic areas for development to drive change and \ncapitalise on developments in the world of work for agriculture. For the purposes \nof the current research, four have been selected to be reviewed. These include: \n• Tomorrow’s Digitally Enabled Workforce \n• The Future of Australia’s Agricultural Workforce \n• Agricultural Innovation – A National Approach to Grow Australia’s Future \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 26 \n \n• National Agricultural Workforce Strategy \nThe contents of these reports shape or frame the research. Examining the \ndiscussions, the predictions, and the arguments outlined in these reports inform \nthe research aims of the current study. \nTomorrow’s Digitally Enabled Workforce \nTomorrow’s Digitally Enabled Workforce (Hajkowicz, Resson, Rudd, Bratanova, \nHodgers, Mason, & Boughen, 2016) proposes that the requirements for the \nfuture workforce depend upon workforce transitions. This includes how \nindividuals adapt to change at work or change their jobs, and how workforce \nstructures including the number of people, the kinds of roles, and the \npermanency of labour requirements shifts. The report lays out four potential \nfuture scenarios based on the rate of change across two axes: the level of task \nautomation that occurs in the workplace, and the institutional change that can \noccur with workforce structures including employment models and organisational \ndesigns. These include: \n1. Lakes (low task automation/limited institutional change): Technology \nadoption is limited and little change to workforce structures leaves \nAustralia lagging behind the rest of the world; \n2. Harbours (high task automation/limited institutional change): Automation \nsystems are fully realised, and with little institutional change, workers are \ndisplaced; \n3. Rivers (low task automation/significant institutional change): Technology \nhas been slow to advance with little impact of task automation on jobs, \nbut workforce structures and cultures change with the rise of peer-to-peer \neconomy; \n4. Oceans (high task automation/significant institutional change). Technology \nadvancements are matched with institutional change that creates socially \ninclusive employment models however there are concerns whether \nindividuals adapt to these opportunities or whether this leads to a digital \ndivide. \nImplications from the scenarios for individuals include the requirement for new \nmindsets and development of new capabilities, and a baseline of digital literacy \nskills as well as numeracy and literacy skills not previously required for all \nworkers. The expected job market dynamic is predicted to require greater \nadaptability, resilience and entrepreneurial capabilities and career self-\nmanagement skills to remain open to job and industry transitions. While this \nreport is not specific to Australia’s agriculture industry, it does highlight factors \nthat are expected to be important in understanding and planning for the future \nworkforce requirements for farming businesses with the rise of digital agriculture \ncontinuing to occur in the cotton industry. \nThe Future of Australia’s Agricultural Workforce \nIn the Future of Australia’s Agricultural Workforce (Wu, Dawson, Fleming-Munoz, \nSchleiger, and Horton, 2019), the two drivers of development were found to be \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 27 \n \n(a) the level of regional development, and (b) the advancement of technology \nand uptake of digital agriculture across the sector. Considering the state of these \ntwo factors, four scenarios were proposed for potential futures: \n1. Fast Forward Regions: Strong regional development draws populations \nfrom the cities bringing a critical mass for development of infrastructure \nand services, and R&D investment leads to an influx of technologies \npurpose built for the local contexts; \n2. Regional Revival: Cost of living and lifestyle factors motivate people to \nleave the city for country regions but insufficient investment in R&D \nconstrains the development of agricultural technologies which limits \nwidespread adoption; \n3. Technology Tsunami: Technology development led by multinational \ncompanies breaks new ground, becoming affordable and providing \nautomated solutions to replace labour and reduce reliance and \nrequirements for a local-based workforce; \n4. Treading Water: Investments in regional infrastructure does not occur and \nlack of investment in R&D leaves a gap in local technology development \nwhile multinational companies focus on markets other than Australia for \ntheir digital agriculture advancements. \nThe report further identifies some key challenges and opportunities that require \nco-ordination of multiple stakeholders including governments, industry, and \nregional communities that if done effectively can change the trajectory of work in \nagriculture. Of particular interest to the current research project is the call to \nfocus on (a) the skills development, education, and career development for the \nnext generation to consider pursuit of work in agriculture, (b) investment in the \ndigital literacy and skill development of the on-farm workforce and this cohorts \ncollaboration with technology developers and trialling of new digital agriculture \napproaches to farming, (c) addressing issues with employers, including labour \ncompanies, to reduce workforce exploitation which causes harm to those \ninvolved and reputational harm to the wider agriculture industry, and (d) \nimprovement in the liveability of regional communities including digital \ninfrastructure and access to services. In this way, it is argued that the future of \nwork in agriculture depends on connecting with the next generation; the current \nworkforce adaptability, acceptance and adoption of digital technology; \nimprovement of work conditions on-farm with safe and rewarding jobs on offer; \nand ensuring that agricultural workers can have a good lifestyle and with access \nto similar essential supports, such as reliable internet connection, to their city \ncounterparts while living in regional Australia. \nSpecific issues for the cotton industry were not discussed in the report. However, \nissues for irrigators such as lack of water availability, the consequent impacts \nthis has on consistent work available for employees and contractors, and the  \neffects this has on the liveability of regional communities, highlights the inter-\nrelatedness and complexity of challenges that industries such as cotton face \nwhen seeking to attract, develop and retain their workforce. The uncertainty of \nwater availability is an issue that affects the attraction and retention of capable \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 28 \n \npeople to work in the industry, with local knowledge and skills lost when workers \nexit industry in times of drought. This loss of knowledge and skills constrains \nproduction when the drought breaks and water is available.  \nAgricultural Innovation – A National Approach to Grow Australia’s Future \nIn the Agricultural Innovation – A National Approach to Grow Australia’s Future \nreport (Ernst & Young, 2019) the agricultural innovation culture and ecosystem \nare examined to identify opportunities for improvement that will drive \nproductivity and profitability of the Australian agriculture industry. From this \nreport, a vision for the future of agricultural innovation is identified.  \nThe report argues for the need to shift to a dynamic culture where \nentrepreneurship and openness to risk taking is encouraged to ensure Australian \nagriculture does not lag behind other more developed agricultural innovation \necosystems around the world. The importance of a collaborative knowledge \nnetwork and extension services to inform and encourage farmers to take up new \ntechnology and innovations is identified as a priority. It is anticipated that the \nimproved innovation system will build the capability of innovators to transform \nthe agriculture industry driving improved productivity and output capacity \nthroughout the supply chain.   \nEffective leadership is required to enact the vision identified in this report. \nFurthermore, attraction and development of people through interventions in the \neducation system will increase aspirations to be a part of Australian agriculture. \nThe report is a strategic document with high level concepts identified that may \nbe influential for the future of agricultural work. These factors require further \ndefinition and contextualisation within the cotton industry to understand how the \nfuture of Australian agricultural innovation may shape strategic workforce \ndevelopment for cotton farm businesses.  \nNational Agricultural Workforce Strategy \nThe National Agricultural Workforce Strategy (citation) was released in 2021, \nafter the completion of the current study. While this report did not inform the \ndirection or design of the research, the findings are now examined as these \nassist with framing the current research. The authors of the report argue that \nprioritising technology development as the future of agriculture, rather than \ncapability development is “putting the cart before the horse” as only capably \nskilled people, who understand and prioritise effective business and workforce \nmanagement and the importance of managing the land in environmentally sound \nways are positioned to successfully adopt and integrate technological solutions \n(p. xviii). The findings of the report are discussed with regards to a central goal \nto focus on establishing the systems and cultures for the workforce to engage in \ncontinuous learning and capability development “because all Agrifood sectors \ndepend heavily on people, in order to prosper in changing times, all of them \nneed to train, and develop their people’s capabilities up to ‘best-in-class’ level” \n(p. 7) . Three basic principles were identified that direct activities towards \nachievement of these goals and this includes:   \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 29 \n \n1. Interdependency with co-operation: The agricultural work context is \nconceptualised as an ecosystem that is a web of interdependencies. When \none area of the workforce is compromised this affects other areas. \nPreviously siloed sectors or those who may have worked in opposition to \neach other need improved co-operation for the whole industry to \novercome challenges and grow; \n2. Local Empowerment: Grass roots initiatives focused on workforce \ncapability development need to be empowered through support from the \nvarious levels of government; \n3. Excellence: A genuine culture of continuous improvement and desire to \nchange and adapt that is often associated with production aspects of \nagriculture needs to be extended and applied to all aspects of the industry \nand held by all players associated with agriculture. \nWith regards to workforce trends, there is a growing demand for workforce at \nboth the management and non-management level. This demand stems from high \nturnover, increases in corporate farming and movement of family farms towards \nbigger corporate-like operations, as well as the generational changes that are \noccurring in farming businesses. There is an expected rise in requirements for \ncontractors with farmers needing access to well-trained service providers. \nIncreased focus on sustainability and the developments that come with this, \nincluding digitalisation of work, changing community standards, demands for \nincreased environmental management, and the measurement and scrutiny of \nfarming practices will change the skills requirements and standards for \nagronomists and by extension other occupations in agriculture (Pratley & \nKirkegaard, 2019).  \nIn terms of persistent challenges, outdated perceptions of careers in agriculture \nare barriers to attraction and factors contributing to turnover include amenity \nand lifestyle factors. Issues around equity with the gender imbalance in senior \nleadership and participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within \nthe workforce are flagged as areas for intervention, arguing “The importance of \nequity at every level needs to be stressed, as agriculture needs all available \ntalent and the diversity that comes with it” (p. 32). Concerns about the capability \nand capacity of advisory services to influence adoption of innovative technology \nand farming practices are raised and attributed to the decline of intensive \nextension training that has existed in the past and a shift away from public \nservices to the private sector. In discussing the culture underpinning an overall \nstrategy for the national agricultural workforce, the report states that it must be \n“imbued with inclusiveness, one that appropriately values and rewards employee \ninputs, and one that provides conditions of employment commensurate with 21\nst \ncentury expectations and is competitive with other sectors. Employees matter – \notherwise they will not be there, as recent sector experience has shown.” (p. \n44).  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 30 \n \nSocial Implications of Digital Agriculture \nA consistent theme throughout much of the future-of-work literature is \nconsideration of the impact of digital transformation on the workforce. Within the \npeer-reviewed academic literature, the rise of digital agriculture, or agriculture \n4.0 and the drive towards sustainable intensification of production has to date \npaid limited attention to the social implications of these developments. \nUnderstanding the ‘people’ implications of the potential future changes stemming \nfrom technology adoption, that are being presented in terms of benefits for \nproductivity and the environment, is needed to adequately plan for attraction, \ndevelopment and retention of the agricultural workforce in an increasingly digital \nworkplace.  \nAccording to Vasconez, Kantor and Cheein (2019), there remains a long path to \na fully autonomous agriculture industry due to the significant investments \nrequired and the complexity of processes and systems involved. It can be \nextremely difficult to model each environment, crop and task and therefore the \ncontinued interaction between people and robots needs to factor in continuous \nlearning and adaptation of machines to new conditions. Some of the most \nsuccessful autonomous solutions, such as GPS autosteer, have been \nimplemented for repetitive tasks and aim to reduce workload, optimise process \ntimes and costs. For other more complex tasks, designing technology to include \nhumans within the system (augmentation), means that decision making \ncorrections and problem-solving as opposed to physical labour will be the skills \nrequired from the workforce. In the cotton industry, modelling has identified that \nthe top three areas of productivity improvements will come from digital \ntechnologies associated with irrigation scheduling and application, crop nutrition, \nand optimising quality (Trindall, Rudd, Gillingham, Skinner, Wiseman, Bange, \nMcDonald, Foley & Welsh, 2020). \nWhile benefits for people working on farms linked to increasing automation are \noften framed as bringing improved work conditions (including visibility, safety, \nsimplicity) and related to better decision making (including access to greater \ninformation for feedback from the system and reducing cognitive load), there is \nalso the potential for agri-tech to lead to changes that produce less desirable \noutcomes (Vasconez, Kantor, & Cheein, 2019; Rose, Wheeler, Winter, Lobley, & \nChivers, 2021).  Distance created from adopting technology that removes \nphysical work and people’s presence could reduce farmers’ engagement with and \nunderstanding of their land and environment. Devaluing of experiential \nknowledge, and complexity of data issues including ownership and trust could \nlead to reduced job satisfaction and exacerbate stressors or mental health \nproblems (Lobley et al., 2018, as cited in Rose et al., 2021). While agri-tech will \ncreate jobs, those jobs that are lost or changed through increasing automation \nmay belong to workers who are not sufficiently skilled, prepared, or in possession \nof the abilities required to transition and adapt to these new roles in agriculture \n(Rotz et al., 2019). Failure of farms to keep up with the digital revolution and to \ntransition to collect, manage, and present data in a way that attains \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 31 \n \ntransparency and traceability of the commodities they produce may mean they \nfind themselves locked out of future markets (Miles, 2019). Adding to this \nconcern is that smaller to medium enterprises have been identified as being at \ngreater risk of lagging due to the economies of scale that are sometimes needed \nto make the business case for adoption of new technology (Vasconez, Kanotr, \nAut Cheein, 2019).  It is therefore important to understand more about cotton \nfarm enterprises digital agriculture opportunities, risks, and workforce \nadaptability to inform the strategic development of the workforce to purposefully \nbuild a desirable future for people in the industry.  \nA review of the social science literature on digital agriculture by Kelrkx, Jakku, \nand Labarthe (2019) identified a number of thematic cluster areas including \nemerging topics and questions to shape future required research. Of particular \ninterest to the current study are the series of questions identified in the farmer \nidentity, farmer skills, and farm work thematic cluster: “How is farm work \naffected by digitalisation in terms of farmer skills, in terms of quality and joy? \nWhat deskilling and reskilling processes are triggered? What is the balance \nbetween reliance on digital knowledge, and on experiential knowledge and \nintuition? What is the extent of trust of farmers in information generated by \nmachines?” (p. 9) These questions and the prior points about understanding both \npositive and negative consequences of digital agriculture to shape socially as well \nas economically and environmentally beneficial sustainable change for cotton \nfarm businesses inform the focus of the current research. \nUnderstanding Technology Acceptance \nWhen exploring factors influencing the adoption and acceptance of technology in \nagriculture, the current study is informed by The Technology Acceptance Model – \nVersion 3 (TAM3; Venkatesh & Bala, 2008). The original TAM is based on two \nspecific cognitive beliefs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. These \npredict the acceptance of digital technology as indicated by intentions to use and \nactual use. As this theory was further developed, predictors of perceived \nusefulness and perceived ease of use were included. Antecedents to perceived \nusefulness identified by the model are social influence processes, (including \nsocial norms, and image), cognitive appraisals (including job relevance, output \nquality, and result demonstrability), and perceived ease of use (see Table 1.1 for \ndefinitions). Antecedents to perceived ease of use appraisals include computer \nself-efficacy, perceptions of external control, computer anxiety, computer \nplayfulness, perceived enjoyment and objective useability (see Table 1.2 for \ndefinitions).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 32 \n \n \nTable 1.1.

The Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM-3). Reproduced with permission (Venkatesh & Bala, 2008) \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 34 \n \nMeta-analyses of earlier iterations of the TAM have found ease of use to be \nsignificantly related to perceived usefulness, and perceived usefulness to be \nsignificantly related to acceptance (Ma & Liu, 2004). Another meta-analysis of 88 \nstudies found similar results and further tested moderator effects of use types, \nfinding that the model works similarly well for students and professionals (King & \nHe, 2006). A narrative literature review of 145 papers published on the TAM \nsupports earlier findings. This paper also argues that it is in understanding the \nrelationship between the different antecedents to perceived ease of use and \nperceived usefulness that will inform any intervention that seeks to improve \nacceptance of technology, identifying “which levers to pull to affect these beliefs \nand, through them, the use of technology” (p. 268, Yousafzai, Foxall, & Pallister, \n2007). Widespread continued use of TAM as evidenced in a recent meta-analysis \nof various TAM studies further validates the explanatory power of this model and \npoints to the particular importance of positive attitudes and social influence in \nthe model (Feng, Su, Lin, He, Lu, & Zhange, 2021).  \nResearch Aims \nIn seeking to better understand the future of work from an organisation and \nindustry perspective, several research aims were developed. These included:  \nAim 1: Understand factors influencing technology acceptance and adoption. \nAim 2: Understand grower and workforce experiences of transition that occur \nwith the introduction of technology. \nAim 3: Understand entrepreneurial behaviours and the mindsets, skills and \nstructures that encourage entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship within cotton \nbusinesses. \nAim 4: Understand the function of the knowledge network and consultants work \nin extension and influencing on-farm change. \nAim 5: Understand influences on attraction, retention, and development of \nworkforce and how this occurs in adaptable businesses. \nAim 6: Identify other factors that may shape the future of work and workforce \nrequirements for the Australian cotton industry. \nResearch Design \nThe overall research design consists of two distinct parts: (a) an analysis of the \n2018 Grower Practices Survey, and (b) a multi-case study of cotton farming and \nallied industry professionals to explore different factors associated with the \nfuture of work. \nAnalysis of the 2018 Grower Practices Survey \nThe Grower Practices Survey is an annual survey of cotton growers that collects \ninformation about the past season crop production and other related issues. The \nquestions are updated each year, keeping the survey as succinct as possible, \nwhile ensuring a wide range of data capture over time. In 2018, the opportunity \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 35 \n \nwas provided to researchers within the ‘people’ research stream to capture data \nrelating to the on-farm workforce demographics/structures, attitudes of \nemployers towards workforce and technology adoption relating to automation. \nExpanding on the descriptive analysis presented within the 2018 Grower \nPractices Survey Report, an analysis of this data directly related to the first aim \nof the research project.  \nMulti-Case Study \nThe remainder of the aims are addressed within six case studies. People working \nin adaptable cotton industry businesses clustered around a specific context were \ntreated as single cases. The adapting cotton industry is more broadly considered \nthe target collection to be studied. A pragmatic approach was taken, and these \ncases are not uniform in the roles that participants hold or the number or types \nof perspectives that have been included. Each has been written to focus on \ndifferent factors of interest that were generated either from the literature or the \ndata and aligned with the aims of the research. In this way, these instrumental \ncase studies are facilitating further understanding of the future workforce \nrequirements for the Australian cotton industry, the skills and abilities needed to \nadapt and the structures and systems that attract, develop and retain desirable \nworkers (Stake, 2005).  \nSemi-structured interviews were initially conducted with growers. Depending on \nthe size of the business and research questions that were further generated from \nthe interviews, employees of the enterprise were also invited to participate. The \ninterview schedules used are listed in Appendix A. When selecting participants, \nevery effort was made to include a range of different businesses, larger and \nsmaller enterprises with various levels of staffing, irrigation and dryland \ncropping, and farms in different production valleys. The addition of a case study \non an agronomy consulting business recognises the rise in higher skilled allied \nprofessions and offered a different perspective on practice change in the \nindustry. Existing theory and academic literature have been used in the analysis \nprocess to guide interpretation. Member checks were conducted with all growers \nto ensure the accuracy of the researchers’ interpretation of the transcript data \nand to ensure the ethical standards of research were upheld for participants. \n \nA brief overview of the six cases presented in this report is provided in Table 1.3. \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 36 \n \n \nTable 1.3  Overview of Case Studies \nCase Study Chapter Context Participants Topics \n \nResearch Aims \n1  Chapter 3 Kilmarnock Farm 1 x Employer \n4 x Employees \nTechnology acceptance and adoption \nWorkforce management and development \nLeadership \n \n1, 2, 5 \n2 Chapter 4 Sundown Pastoral  2 x Employers \n3 x Employees \nTechnology acceptance and adoption \nEntrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship \nWorkforce management and development \nLeadership \nTraceability and Transparency \nAttraction and education of the next generation \n \n1, 2, 3, 5, 6 \n3 Chapter 5 Summit Ag \nAgronomists \n2 x Employers Technology acceptance and adoption \nEntrepreneurship  \nKnowledge networks \nRole of consultants \n \n1, 2, 3, 4, 6 \n4 Chapter 6 Northern Australia 1 x Employer \n1 x Employee \n1 x Agronomist \n1 x Researcher \nWorkforce attraction and development \nGrower attraction and development \nTechnology acceptance and adoption \nSocial Licence \n \n1, 2, 4, 5, 6 \n5 Chapter 7 Dalara Pastoral 1 x Employer Workforce management and development \nLeadership \nKnowledge networks \nSuccession Planning \nAttraction and education of the next generation \n \n4, 5, 6 \n6 Chapter 8 Columboola Cotton 1 x Employer Leadership \nWorkforce management and development \nCommunity liveability \n \n2, 5, 6 \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 37 \n \n \nConclusion \nUnderstanding the future of work and ensuring the cotton industry is prepared to \nstrategically manage the transitions its workforce will need to undergo is of \nutmost importance. Many factors are influencing change in the types of workers, \nskillsets, and the workforce structures that will be required for the industry to \ncontinue to thrive. While the literature identifies digital agriculture, \nentrepreneurship, and continuous learning and development as central to the \nfuture of work, the factors have been studied only at a conceptual level. \nEmpirical research is needed to understand the reality and practicality of how \nthese factors shape the changing nature of work for people at the farm level and \nto identify where intervention could improve the adaptability of businesses. The \ncurrent research addressed this gap in knowledge and in doing so sought to \nexpand the evidence base that describes the mindsets, structures, actions, \nbehaviours, and skills that are important for the future of work in the cotton \nindustry. \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 38 \n \nChapter Two: Technology acceptance, \nadoption, and workforce in cotton farms \nIntroduction \nThe agricultural industry is undergoing a digital revolution with technology \nadoption changing the workforce required on farms. In Chapter Two, an analysis \nof the 2018 Grower Practices Survey data extends on the CRDC industry report. \nQualitative data are thematically analysed, and descriptive and inferential \nstatistical analyses of quantitative data are used to understand more about \ntechnology acceptance, technology adoption, attitudes about workforce, and \nworkforce structures. A simple version of the core constructs identified by the \ntechnology acceptance model were tested. \n \nFigure 2.1. Technology acceptance model as adapted from Davis, Bagozzi, & \nWarshaw (1989). Factors highlighted in yellow were studied in the 2018 Grower \nPractices Survey. \nMethods \nParticipants \nInitial respondents to the survey consisted of 246 growers. Although by the time \ngrowers reached the beginning of the questions on automation (module seven) a \nlittle over a quarter had dropped out (N = 68). Many of these people had \nwithdrawn by the third module of questions (N = 65) so it is unlikely that an \naversion to answering questions about automation or workforce was the cause. A \ncomparison of the participants who dropped out with those retained showed no \nstatistically significant difference in age (t(210) = -0.99, p = 0.32), size of farm \n(t(232) = -.36, p = 0.72), or total area of cotton planted (t(210) = .39, p = \n0.69). \nTwo participants (Response ID: 120, 166) data were removed due to a large \namount of missing data. For one of these participants, this potentially was due to \ntheir status as  an employee on a corporate farm and hence they felt they could \n\n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 39 \n \nnot answer questions about ‘their farm’. For the remaining 176 growers, who \nwere participants for the modules on automation and workforce, ages ranged \nfrom 20 years to over 65 years old, with an average age in the range of category \n5 (45-49 years old) (mean = 5.24; median = 5.00)1. The area of these growers’ \nfarms that was dedicated to broad acre cropping ranged from 90 hectares to \n62,400 hectares (mean = 3,879.81 hectares, median = 1,495.00 hectares). This \nwas positively skewed, with 95% of growers reporting their farms had less than \n11,000 hectares developed for broad acre crop production. Growers were located \nin the following production valleys: the Murrumbidgee (N = 32), lower Namoi \n(including Walgett; N = 24), the Darling Downs (N = 22), the Upper Namoi (N = \n20), the Gwydir (N = 18), the Macquarie (N = 15), Border Rivers (N = 14), \nCentral Queensland (N = 11), St George/Dirranbandi (N = 10), the Lachlan (N= \n6), Bourke (N = 1), Murray (N = 1) and The Ord (N = 1). \nProcedure \nThe data analysed in the current study was collected as part of the larger Grower \nPractices Survey in June-July 2018. Growers were initially contacted by phone \nand encouraged to complete the survey over the phone or to complete the \nsurvey online. Growers for whom email addresses were available were also \ncontacted through these means and again, invited to complete the survey online. \nCotton production for this season was substantial due to a favourable season for \nirrigated summer crops, although a lack of rainfall throughout the season \nnegatively impacted dryland production. \nMeasures \n \nDemographic Questions \nDemographic questions including age, area of farm developed for broad acre \ncropping, and location of farm. These were used to investigate any nuances \nbetween groups of cotton growers. \nAdoption of Technology \nParticipants were asked “Are you currently using any automation (including \nautomation for irrigation) on your farm? Examples of automation include \nunpiloted air and ground vehicles, intelligent decision systems, AI, etc.” They \nwere able to select from three categories (1) Yes, I currently use automation on \nmy farm, (2) No, but I’m considering options for the future, and (3) No, and I \nhave no plans to implement the use of automation on my farm. \nParticipants were able to interpret automation however they wished and could \nreport what technologies they were using and what they were considering. On \nreview some growers in the “yes” category indicated that the automation they \nwere thinking of was GPS autosteer tractors. This automated technology is \n \n1 Age was measured as an ordinal variable with categories listed as (1) under 20, (2) 20-\n34, (3) 35-39, (4) 40-44, (5) 45-49, (6) 50-54, (7) 55-59, (8) 60-64, (9) 65+ \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 40 \n \nalready widely adopted across industry, and it is likely that many people in either \nof the “no” categories currently also use this type of automation. Therefore, the \ndecision was made to change the research question to “Are you currently using \nany automation other than GPS tractor autosteer on your farm?”. The data was \nreviewed and recategorised such that those who only referred to GPS autosteer \ntractors as their automated technology used were assigned to category (2) No, \nbut I am considering options for the future depending or (3) No, and I have no \nplans to implement the use of automated technologies, depending on their \nresponses to questions about what other technologies they were considering for \nthe future. \nPerceived Usefulness Scale and Perceived Ease of Use Scale \nThe Perceived Usefulness Scale and Perceived Ease of Use Scale were developed \nin conjunction with other researchers on CRDC-funded workforce projects and \nreviewed by a panel of experts from CRDC before inclusion in the Grower \nPractices Survey. To meet the current project objectives, these are specifically \nfocused on workforce related benefits that impact the organisation of labour on \nfarm and the changing skills profiles required to successfully implement digital \ntechnologies on farm. For future CRDC projects investigating adoption of digital \nagriculture technology and practices, there is potential for these scales to be \nexpanded. It is recommended that inclusion of items developed to capture \neconomic and environmental drivers of perceived usefulness and more specific \nitems included to capture the ease of use for automation and other digital \ntechnologies would provide a more complete measure.  \nThe Perceived Usefulness Scale was designed to measure growers’ perceptions \nthat automated technology provided them with benefits such as (a) reduced \nlabour costs, (b) more efficient workforce performance, and (c) reduced the time \nand effort required managing staff or performing tasks, allowing them to find \nbetter work-life balance, or work on other parts of the business. The Perceived \nUsefulness Scale consisted of 5-items that were rated on a Likert-Type Scale \nfrom (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree.  \nThe Perceived Ease of Use Scale was designed to measure growers’ perceptions \nthat (a) they could easily adopt digital technology in terms of the skills required \nto operate and maintain, (b) they could easily integrate digital technology into \ntheir existing farming systems, and (c) that they could attract new workforce \nwith sufficient skills, or their existing workforce were adaptive to develop the \nskills required to adopt new digital technologies. Perceived Ease of Use consisted \nof 4-items that were rated on a Likert-Type Scale from (1) strongly disagree to \n(5) strongly agree. \nOpen-ended Questions Regarding Technology Use \nQualitative data was collected with regards to the types of automation currently \nbeing used, the types of automation being considered for use, and reasons for \nnot currently adopting automated technologies (other than GPS auto steer \ntractors) on farm.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 41 \n \nWorkforce Structure \nSeveral questions were asked about workforce structure and the following are \nconsidered within the current study: (a) reduction in workers after \nimplementation of automated technology, (b) total number of workers employed \non farm, (c) the fraction of permanent employees on farm, (d) the fraction of \nentry-level employees on farm. \nAttitudes and Practices Related to Workforce \nThree measures were developed to capture attitudes that growers held towards \ntheir workforce and the level of agreement that they were performing MyBMP \nLevel 3 HR actions aimed at managing their workers’ development and \nperformance, as well as reflecting on feedback they gain from their workers that \nstay or leave the business. These scales were (a) The People Management scale, \n(b) The Satisfaction with Workforce Scale, and (c) The Value of Workers Scale.  \nResearch Questions \nAfter screening and assumption testing of the data, the following questions have \nguided the analysis of the data generated from the Grower Practices Survey \ndata. \n \n1. What are the automated technologies that are currently used by growers? \n2. What technologies are being considered? \n3. Why are people not currently using automated technology on farm? \n4. Are there relationships between attitudes to technology adoption, HR \npractices, and attitudes to workforce, farm size, number of employees, \nproportion of full-time employees, proportion of entry level employees? \n5. What variables predict the following group membership: (a) Yes, using \nautomation (b) No, but considering, (c), No and not considering?  \nResults \nGrowers have been sorted into three groups based on their adoption and \nacceptance of automated solutions. These were (a) Yes, I am currently using \nautomation (other than GPS auto steer) on my farm (N = 52), (b) No, but I am \nconsidering automated solutions (N = 74), and (c) No, and I have no plans to \nimplement automation (N = 50). \nGrowers currently using automation other than GPS auto steer machinery on \ntheir farm were using automation for several tasks including: (a) seeding, (b) \nirrigation, (c) fertiliser application, (d) spray application, (e) crop monitoring and \ncollection of field data by satellite, (f) soil moisture management, (g) module \ntracking, and (h) reducing reliance on the workforce. Qualitative responses to \nquestions about technology being considered were analysed at the group level \nand are presented in Table 2.1. These responses ranged from referring to specific \ntechnologies to being more general in terms of the purpose for which these \nautomated technologies were to be used, or motivational factors for seeking \nthese out. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 42 \n \nTable 2.1 Comparison of Growers currently using automated solutions and those who are \nconsidering automated solutions for type of technology and motivation to adopt. \nGrower Group Yes, I am currently using \nautomation (other than GPS auto \nsteer tractors) on my farm (N = \n52) \nNo, but I am considering \nautomated solutions (N = 74) \nAutomated \nsolutions being \nconsidered  \nIrrigation (centre pivots, padman stops \nto open channel gates remotely, \nautomated pumps, pump monitoring) \nRobotic sprayer \nAutomation to shut down machinery. \nDoing more with tractors/automated \ntractors and sprayers \nMapping and inventory (data collection) \nCrop Monitoring \nEnergy (solar generator) \n \nNot considering more automated \nsolutions beyond what is currently used \n(N = 17) \nIrrigation (automated bankless \nsystem, water gate \nautomation/channels remote stop \nand start, water level monitoring, \npump monitoring) \nSprays and chemical application \n(unmanned spray vehicles, \nVariable rate fertiliser, Weather \nstations to inform spray decisions) \nWeed management (Robots for \nkilling weeds/automated vehicle \nwith microwave for hard to kill \nweeds/weed seeking technology) \nSeeding and planting (precision) \nCrop monitoring and management \n(canopy temp sensors, drones, \nField mapping, NDVI scans) \nDriverless tractors \nScouting (pests) \nWi-Fi for all areas of the farm \n \nMotivations for \nconsidering \nother \nautomated \nsolutions on \nfarm \nAccuracy and Ease of Management \n(everyone knows what is happening) \nLabour saving/ run a smaller, better \nskilled workforce/Reduce workload. \nFor demonstration purposes \nFor efficiencies \nSave time, money, reduce \nworkload, Save on labour. \n \n \nGrowers who were not currently using automated technology beyond GPS \nautosteer were asked to provide reasons.

Growers \nwere sorted into three categories: (a) those who have already adopted \nautomated technologies, (b) those who have not but are considering solutions, \nand (c) those who have not and have no plans to adopt automated technologies. \nOverall findings from this chapter that are discussed further include: \n• Reasons such as drought, finances, infrastructure, and legacy farming \nsystems may prevent even those interested in automation from adoption.  \n• Growers considering technology can see the usefulness of automated \nsolutions and are confronting ease-of-use barriers to implementation. \n• Growers considering technology have a growth mindset and are less \nsatisfied with the status quo compared to those not considering \nautomation. \n• All groups indicated they highly valued their workforce. \n• Good people management practices are associated with perceptions that \nworkers are adaptable and can be trusted to work autonomously.  \n• Ease of use is related to perceived usefulness of technology and perceived \nusefulness is the factor that differentiates those not considering \nautomation with those that are considering automation or have already \nadopted. \n• The age/stage of life that growers are at in their career may influence \ntheir consideration of automation solutions. \nWhen comparing the reasons for why people are not currently implementing \nautomation on their farms yet for those ‘considering’ with those ‘not considering’ \nautomated solutions, the two groups offer similar responses in many areas \nincluding structural reasons such as business/farm setup and capital cost \noutlays. Where they differ is that fewer people ‘considering’ technology reported \nan absence of need (yet) compared to those with no plans to implement \nautomation. Growers who are considering automated solutions are more specific \nabout ease-of-use barriers such as working out how to integrate technology, \nskills required, time needed to investigate, and needing to see reliable support. \nThis shows greater acceptance of and critical engagement with automated \ntechnologies while highlighting barriers to adoption. Those ‘considering’ are also \nmore likely to report that they are investing elsewhere indicating a growth and \ndevelopment approach to their farm business even if that does not include \ncurrent adoption of automated technologies. In contrast, for those who are not \nconsidering any automated solutions, some (8%) disclosed an attachment to \ntheir current infrastructure and practices and hesitance to look beyond the status \nquo on their farm.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 51 \n \nAll groups are similar in the high level of value they place on their workforce, \ntheir use of best practice people management approaches and their levels of \nsatisfaction with their workforce. The greater the proportion of workers on farm \nthat were permanent, the more satisfied growers reported being with their \nworkforce. The more entry level employees the less satisfied growers were with \ntheir workforce and there was also a small negative correlation such that the \nlarger the number of employees on farm the less satisfied growers were with \ntheir workforce. Larger teams had more entry level employees and more casual \nworkers compared to smaller teams.  \nThere are some small correlations of interest at the item level between some of \nthe attitudes to workforce scales and perceptions of ease of use (although \nneither reached significance). A closer look at the item level correlations revealed \nthat the items “I have encouraged workers to give me their suggestions and \nfeedback about farming matters” and “I have regularly provided feedback to my \nstaff in relation to the performance of their jobs” are correlated with “My workers \nare capable of adapting in their work roles to use automated technology on my \nfarm” (r = 0.25, p < 0.01; r = 0.20, p < 0.05). These two people-management \npractices are also related to reports of greater trust in employees to complete \ntasks with less oversight (r = 0.69, p < 0.01; r = 0.54, p < 0.01), and “I am \nsatisfied with the staff we have on farm” (r = 0.43, p < 0.01; r = 0.39, p < \n0.01). Seeking feedback from staff is also particularly important for preventing \nworkers becoming disengaged (r = 0.26, p , 0.01). This suggests that good \npeople management practices that promote a two-way relationship and exchange \nof ideas are important for retention of valued workers and helping workers to \nadapt in changing workplaces.  \nLike the findings of other TAM studies, the current research found a moderate \ncorrelation between ease of use and perceived usefulness. Further investigation \nshows the correlation between ease of use and perceived usefulness is stronger \nfor those who are already using automated technology on farm (r = 0.53, p < \n0.01) compared to those who are not using automated technology on farm (r = \n0.32, p < 0.01 for those considering, and .r = 0.39, p < 0.01 for those not \nconsidering). This indicates that ease of use appraisals are particularly important \nfor assessing the usefulness of technology for those further along the adoption \ncurve (accounting for approximately 28% of the variance) but for those yet to \nadopt, their skill levels, ability to integrate technology, or the adaptability of their \nworkforce accounts for less variance (15%) with regards to their assessment of \nthe usefulness of automated technologies.  \nPerceived usefulness of automated technology is an important factor in \ndetermining the likelihood that someone is already using automation solutions or \nconsidering using automation solutions compared to those who have no plans to \nimplement automation solutions. With one unit increase in perceived usefulness, \nthe odds that growers are considering or have adopted automated technology \nrose by approximately 30%. Understanding the value proposition of automated \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 52 \n \ntechnology is important to start growers on their way to exploring and engaging \nin consideration and eventual adoption of digital agriculture.  \nWhile the analysis is underpowered in terms of sample size, it is interesting to \nnote that belonging to the age group 20-34 years or 44-49 years also could \npredict a greater likelihood to be considering technology compared with those \nwho had no plans. It may be that these two age groups represent growers who \nare at the start of their career and keen to explore new digital tools to use within \ntheir business, or growers who have children in teen years/early adulthood who \nare considering the future of their business for the next generation. The \ntreatment of age by groups, as opposed to a continuous variable allowed for this \nnon-linear relationship to be identified. The smaller sample contributes to the \nvery large confidence intervals for these findings, and as such these results \nshould be cautiously considered. Nonetheless, it does indicate further research \non life stage could be important in considering the growers’ willingness to \ndedicate time and effort to engage in activities that leads to acceptance and \nadoption of digital technologies into their farming businesses.  \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 53 \n \nChapter Three: Kilmarnock Farm: \nTransformational Leadership Facilitating \nChange and Adaptation of the Workforce \nIntroduction \nAndrew and Heike Watson own and operate two farms spanning 4000 hectares in \nthe Namoi Valley with a mix of irrigation (1650 ha), and dryland (1200 ha) \ncropping, with the balance being grazing and support land. While cotton is a \nmajor focus of farm activities, with approximately 80% of farm income attributed \nto this crop (Smith & Watson, 2018), they also grow durum wheat, canola, \nchickpeas, and sorghum, with plans to add corn to their rotation. At the time of \nthe interview, (Spring 2019), they had harvested 660 ha of irrigated cotton, and \n330 ha of dryland cotton in the 18/19 season and were facing an even drier \nseason with no river water allocation for 2019/20. \nOn the back of the Murray Darling Basin buyback efficiency scheme, the Watsons \nhave been able to invest in exploring a number of different irrigation systems \nincluding automated methods, lateral move irrigation, and a large pipe through \nthe bank system. Other new technologies already adopted include GPS in \nmachinery and variable rate machinery (with further interest in exploring \nvariable rate technologies). Since the interview, the Watsons have been \nexploring the use of drone application of beneficial insects to control for silver \nleaf whitefly with promising results.  \nThe Watsons are considered early adopter growers and have developed a \nreputation as an employer of choice, rarely needing to advertise and generally \napproached by people seeking work. Their staff members range in age from 32 \nyears to 65 years old, with the newest serving employee starting 18 months ago \nand the longest serving employee with them for the last 25 years. All have \nexperienced adoption of new technology or changes to farm management during \nthe period of their employment. The interviews with Andrew and most of his \npermanent staff (staffing at the time consisted of 4 full time employees, 1 part \ntime employee) sought to understand more about technology adoption and the \nchanging workforce requirements on farm. Over the course of the case study, it \nbecame clear that successful change management and technology acceptance on \nthis farm was underpinned by Andrew Watson’s utilisation of behaviours that can \nbe categorised as transformational leadership, establishing a psychologically safe \nenvironment and developing his team by operating as a connector manager. \nThese concepts are further explored within the following questions: \n• How does the grower strategically plan and adapt to change in farming? \n• How are workers changing in their jobs on farm? \n• What influences technology adoption for the grower? \n• What influences workers acceptance of new technology on farm? \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 54 \n \nHow does the grower strategically plan and adapt to change in farming? \nThe adaption process within the farming business is influenced by the Watson’s \napproach to personal development, the inclusion of workforce priorities in their \nstrategic approach to their business, and the people management practices that \nthey use to achieve their strategic vision.  \nPersonal Development \nAndrew Watson’s skills and abilities that are applied to his farming business have \nbeen developed through several activities and experiences including, but not \nlimited to: \n• Tertiary education and training – Agricultural Economics (honours degree), \nApplied Finance and Investment and Technical Analysis (graduate \ndiplomas), Australian Institute of Company Directors course. \n• Industry supported development programs – Nuffield scholar.  \n• Industry representative positions – Cotton Australia Chairman of the \nBoard, NFF Policy Council, Farmer reference panels with the GRDC, Land & \nWater Australia, Cotton Catchment Communities CRC, NSW Irrigators \nCouncil and Namoi Water Board; \n• On-farm work experiences – multi-generational farming family, second \ngeneration on the current properties, focus on sustainable farming and \nenvironment regeneration activities within the family business. \n• Other past work experiences – work integrated management training with \nprevious employers including National Australia Bank, NSW Agriculture \nand Namoi Cotton Co-op, owning and operating a contracting business, \nentrepreneurial endeavours developing machinery, participating in \nresearch and development trials with CRDC. \nWhen discussing adopting innovation on farm, it was acknowledged that there is \na culture of openness to new ideas in the farming communities within which \nAndrew is a member, noting “The cotton industry always seems to have braved \nthe forefront of a lot of change”. Learning is recognized as an ongoing process. \nFinding information and identifying and exploring future opportunities for \nimprovement is done in several ways that include (a) accessing networks of early \nadopter growers, (b) on-farm experimentation, (c) direct approaches from \nmachinery dealers, researchers, ag-tech entrepreneurs, and (d) discussions with \nother people associated with the farm business including Heike (business \npartner/wife) and an agronomist. Having a good knowledge of the wide range of \nsolutions and strategies that can be used to improve sustainability is important. \nMaintaining an awareness of what is happening in the wider cotton industry, \nnational agriculture industry and global farming enterprises helps Andrew to be \naware of various solutions to reduce inputs, maximise yields, and tackle pest and \ndisease problems. \nWorkforce Strategy \n \nStrategic workforce planning and management is part of the overall business \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 55 \n \nstrategy for the farming operation. This is made clear in a statement of purpose \nthat is informed by the economic, environmental, and social values of the farm \nbusiness: Kilmarnock is a profitable, ecologically sustainable and safe farming \nbusiness where people want to work.  \nAs Andrew explains: \nFirstly, it's got to be profitable, otherwise you're not going to be here. \nSecond, we've got a pretty strong belief in ecological sustainability. We need \nto work on that. We actually enjoy doing what we do and we'd actually like \nthe people who are here to enjoy what they do and feel safe doing so. So \nthat's pretty important. \nThe part about enjoying stuff is people actually want to come to work. So \nthey get up in the morning and they want to come to work because we \nmake it fun or enjoyable or it has some purpose for them too, and they feel \nempowered by the business that their decisions will be listened to. So that's \nthe overall purpose. \nThe Watsons have then written a clear list of objectives that guide their work. \nIncluded in these are two points that explicitly relate to their role as employers: \nThere is a safe work culture in which people want to work.  \nThe business helps to educate and train young people in agriculture.  \n \nOther objectives relate to actions to ensure economic sustainability for the \nbusiness, environmental sustainability particularly reduction in chemical inputs, \ncollegial and supportive relationships with fellow growers, social sustainability for \nthe farm, industry and community, and an inclusive culture for family \ninvolvement in the business. While these objectives may not directly be about \nworkforce development, they set the business culture and performance \nstandards that shape the work context that people experience in their \nemployment. \nPeople Management \n \nEngineering risk out of the workplace is the best option, but to have an \nunderlying culture of safety means risks are better identified in the \nbeginning, and is the birthplace of engineering outcomes that reduce or \neliminate risk.  \n \nAndrew’s approach to human resources and people management was to establish \nthe workplace culture that would encourage the behaviours that effectively and \nefficiently achieve the outcomes of the business. Not having a skilled, capable, \nand engaged workforce that are adapting to change could be a production \nlimiting factor. With this risk identified, effective actions have been taken to \nmitigate this risk. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 56 \n \nI see that as a threat, not being able to get those staff or those people. But \nhaving said that, we've recognized as a threat for quite a while and so I \ncurrently do have the staff to do what I need. If that makes sense? So \nwe've been actively working to train the guys we've got and to get them \nthinking about remembering things for the next year, or getting guys on \nboard who have got the ability. So I see it as an ongoing threat, but I don't \nsee it as an imminent one.  \n \nFrom Andrew’s experience, get people management right and, (a) employees are \nretained which brings efficiencies in being able to trust their decision-making \ncapabilities and ability to work autonomously, (b) worker engagement is \nimproved such that they want to come to work and are dedicated in their jobs, \nand (c) a reputation as an employer of choice is established, making it easier to \nattract good candidates when needing to hire. \nWorkforce Development Strategies: transformational leadership, psychological \nsafety, acting as a connector manager. \n \nThe overarching approach and day-to-day activities of workforce development on \nKilmarnock can be understood through the theoretical lens of transformational \nleadership. Transformational Leadership is defined as “a set of behaviors of \nleaders who motivate followers to perform and identify with organizational goals \nand interests and who have the capacity to motivate employees beyond expected \nlevels of work performance” (Sarros, Cooper, and Santora, 2008, p. 146). \nAccording to Bass (1985), these behaviours occur across four dimensions: (a) \ninspirational motivation, (b) idealised influence, (c) intellectual stimulation, and \n(c) individualised consideration. These four leadership behaviours are also \nimportant for managing change on the farm in terms of influencing workers \nacceptance of change and willingness to adapt.  \nInspirational Motivation \nInspirational motivation can be characterised as leaders communicating a shared \nvision and inspiring followers to dedicate themselves in working towards high \nperformance standards that are clearly explained and expected of them. This \nhappens on Kilmarnock in four ways, (a) an annual performance review that \ndiscusses the achievement of past goals and setting of future goals, (b) regular \ninformal feedback about job performance, (c) developing a shared strategy for \nimplementing changes, and (d) in the day-to-day discussion of farm activities \nand communicating why these are important. \nSo we have an annual review, which is essentially one meeting a year which \n(staff members) are told is going to happen and they can bring anything \nforward. I bring forward my overall view of how they were for the year. \nHowever, I have developed the philosophy with me and the staff where if \nthey’re doing something wrong, they hear about it. But the flip side is if \nthey do it right they hear about that too. So, you know, you know, I always \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 57 \n \ntell them you're doing a good job here. That's quite a regular conversation \nto the point of almost weekly. Informally, I guess I'm there every day \ntalking to them and we will make a real practice of talking about things. – \nAndrew Watson \nWhen investigating the potential for technology adoption and new farm \nmanagement strategies, Andrew will get more senior staff involved by bringing \nthem into investigating and evaluating the new technology, making them part of \nthe discussion of what the future on farm will be and through this will facilitate \ntheir commitment to the collective vision for the farming enterprise. \nI involve them in the discussion. So when I did a tour down south to look at \nthis new irrigation system I took one of my managers down, we went and \nhad a look and we went to the factory that makes them and discussed it and \ncame back and then came up with a plan to develop that. I try and involve \nthe guys in that. If we're going to go and look at a new tractor or a new \ntype of technology I generally take the two managers along. Or we'll get a \ndemonstration here and then afterwards we'll sit down and say, what do you \nthink? I'll try and involve them in those steps and I find that that really \nbrings them along. – Andrew Watson \nIn turn, this approach to managing and motivating people flows down the chain, \nwith this leadership capability particularly being noted as an important skill for \nhis new farm manager.  \nHe's so good at talking about the end game. This is what we're trying to do \nwith his job. And  I guess he's bringing the others along a bit on that sort of \nfocus because that's kind of the way I think. “So what are we trying to \nachieve here?” - That's how I've always tried to get people to think and \nsometimes (the staff) get a bit tied up in the minutiae of greasing the \nbearings as opposed to “what are we trying to do here?” You need a balance \nand I guess (the farm manager) brings that view of the, what are we trying \nto achieve thing and trying to get the others just thinking along those lines \ntoo. - Andrew Watson \nIdealised Influence \nIdealised influence refers to leaders who are good at ‘talking the talk’ to also be \n‘walking the walk’, acting as a role model and ensuring actions are consistent \nwith the shared vision. People management practices were aligned with the farm \nbusiness’ purpose statement and objectives. Two examples included (a) setting \nbehavioural standards and encouraging staff to adopt a mindset that makes the \nfarm a safe workplace where people want to work, and (b) giving staff learning \nexperiences to test their ability to make crop decisions.  \nUnderpinning this is a culture that epitomises psychological safety. A \npsychologically safe environment is one where people “feel comfortable sharing \nconcerns and mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution” \n(Edmonson, 2019).  Psychological safety is associated with transformational \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 58 \n \nleadership and a range of other work design characteristics that may be fostered \nthrough the different facets of transformational leadership. While  this concept is \nintroduced with regards to idealised influence, it is also through intellectual \nstimulation and individualised consideration that worker autonomy, \ninterdependence, and role clarity can be developed, and through which a \npsychologically safe environment takes shape (Frazier, Fainshmidt, Klinger, \nPezeshkan, & Vracheva, 2017). \n \nAt Kilmarnock safety is not simply a checklist but a culture. As Andrew explains:  \nWe’ve tried to encourage the culture of “That’s dangerous. Let’s not do it \nuntil we work out a way that it’s safe”, or “I don’t feel comfortable doing \nthis, right, stop. Let’s go find some answers.”  \nCreating an environment where staff are unafraid to speak up about concerns or \nfind help is further established on Kilmarnock by encouraging the team to \nsupport each other. The added benefit of this is they assist each other’s learning \nand this process and culture was described by all team members. This helps \nfacilitate people adapting to use new technology. \nEveryone on farm has got different skills. We each call each other just to get \nideas on things, that’s where we can get over the technology gap in some \nways. Just trying to ring someone else and they might have one hint to get \nto that stage and then you might be able to figure it out from there yourself. \n-Employee 1 \nBeyond support from colleagues, the team culture was central to people wanting \nto come to work.   \nInterviewer: What's important for you to get your particular job done well \non farm? \nEmployee 2: Uh, probably trying to get it done to the best of your ability \nit is 50%, and then I like having a bit of fun at work. I don't come to work, \ndo my job and go home. You know, I come have a bit of a joke with the \nboys. Make the day interesting. Have a chat. That's the way I like to do my \njob and do it as best you can. \nOne example of building this culture and supporting learning, was through an \nannual competition on farm, where staff (and Andrew) were each given their own \narea of the crop to irrigate, and a yield competition was held. Through this fun \nexperience, and with their employer participating alongside them, staff \ndeveloped their knowledge of the impacts that decisions could have on the crop \nand expanded their decision-making skills. \n \nThere's a fair bit of humour involved in that. But it does get them thinking \nabout their patch. You know, one of them will come to me and say, well, \nthere's a few weeds in here is that going to impact on the yield? And I say, \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 59 \n \nyep, what are we going to do? (Or they ask) well, if I start irrigating on \nSunday, that's probably better than if I start Monday morning? – Andrew \nWatson \nAndrew spoke of his desire to lead by example and the value of showing workers \nhe was willing to also do what was asked of them. However, he also \nacknowledged the time pressures this could add to his own work, which requires \nmany other tasks other than managing staff.  \nThey're also getting repetitive boring work… we still need to go pick up \nsiphons in 40 degrees…And that's why I do it myself. I guess one of the \nthings I've always said is if I'm not prepared to do it myself I can't expect \nothers, which then puts a lot of pressure on you as an operator to be the \nguy doing all the work in the office as well as having to change siphons and \nphysically help pick some items up.  \nIntellectual Stimulation \nThe dimension of intellectual stimulation involves leaders actively seeking team \nmembers’ suggestions and feedback as well as encouraging them to ask \nquestions and challenge assumptions. Andrew does this by asking further \nquestions to encourage staff to think through challenges. This is done in a \nsupported manner, encouraging workers to give their solution for a shared \nproblem (i.e. what are we going to do?). \nSomeone comes to me and tells me this is broke and oh this is not working. \nI say, well what are we going to do? You know, I want them to think about \nthe answers. So they actually come and say, this is broken and this is how \nwe're going to fix it. Is that alright? So, that's what we encourage them to \ndo. – Andrew Watson \nThis is the “safe spot” where problems are shared but individuals’ opinions are \nvalued and staff are encouraged to engage in critical thinking about their work.  \nI'm not just presented with problems, I'm presented with answers. So that \ngives you a lot of efficiencies. - Andrew Watson \nTo do this more efficiently, Andrew employs whereever possible a connector \nmanager style - he will give guidance in areas where he has expertise but he has \nalso spent time ensuring other team members have expertise that can be called \non to support each other on farm or direct access to other experts off-farm. \nI also encourage a lot of conversation between them, understanding the \ndifferent skill sets between them. So that when there's a welding problem, \ngo and get the guy who's a good welder. Because it'll be done right. If \nthere's a problem with a spreader and one guy's an expert in it, but you are \ndriving it, just ring him up and ask him how to fix it. – Andrew Watson \nAs the different workers explain: \n \nWhen it comes to workshop skill sets everyone rings me. I mean for repairs \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 60 \n \nand those sort of things ---only because I've been doing it for a fair while. \nThey'll ring Andy and Andy says just ring (staff member), he'll tell you all \nabout it – Employee 1. \nOf late Andy has put a new farm manager on … I wouldn’t say he’s really \ntech savvy but he can work things out, quite well with technologies… he’s \nonly young still but he’s not silly, he’s pretty well switched on. So I’ve given \nhim a few calls. But other than that Andy just sends a phone number to us \nand says, “Yeah, ring this fella.”  It could be someone from a technology \nbrand that’s actually sold the machine to Andy, but that’s how we sort of get \naround things. – Employee 1 \nI talk to a few techs and a few different people. There's a John Deere \nmechanic we know in town and he comes out and I talk to him about a fair \nbit of mechanical stuff. If I've got a problem with a tractor, I usually give \nhim a call and he'll help you out. Andrew, he sources a lot of people that \nwork with him on his farm and when I came on he introduced me to \neveryone and I now speak to them. – Employee 2 \nYou either ring up the tech fella that we buy the gear off and just ask them. \nOr Andrew’s got his head around it a little bit. There's still things he doesn't \nknow on there. But  you just talk to other employees. Some of us have got \nmore of an idea than others. – Employee 3 \nIndividualised Consideration \nIndividualised consideration means that leaders seek to understand their staff as \nindividuals and work to support their needs. For example, supporting individuals \nto understand their strengths and develop their expertise is part of ensuring their \nneeds for autonomy and competence are met. Ensuring each team member’s \nwellbeing is prioritised and they are able to meet their commitments outside of \nwork is also part of individualised consideration. \nSpending the time to thoroughly understand the different skill sets and interests \neach worker at Kilmarnock brings to the job is an important part of managing the \nteam. Identifying any skills gaps or individual differences in how people approach \ntheir work (slow and attention to detail, or faster and bigger picture) also helps \nwhen considering what abilities or orientations to look for when hiring new team \nmembers.  \nSo the older guys are perfectionists. Everything they do has to be right, so \nthey work slower. They think about it, they'll stop and bring the machine up \nin the shade and fix something. They're absolute perfectionists. (The newer \nfarm manager) is not quite as much of that, but is really committed to the \nfinal outcome of the job. So less absolute focused on the minutiae but \nunderstanding the outcome of the job. (Our other operator) is a real mix, \nmuch less of a perfectionist. He can get onto a job and sort of forgets about \nthe outcome a bit but if you can get him focused, his skillsets amazing. - \nAndrew Watson \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 61 \n \nWorking with individuals to develop their expertise and to take ownership of \ncertain tasks or operation of specific machinery is part of the way the workforce \nis structured to get a good performing team.  \nWe've tried to employ people with different skills, but we've also developed \nskillsets over time. One of the things is I give each staff member \nresponsibility for a certain operation. One is in charge of the header, one's \nin charge of the picker, one's in charge of fertilizing and they've all got one \nor two or three specific skillsets. When they know how to do that, they are \nresponsible for maintaining it and for telling me what we need to do for it \nfor the following year… And then we'll train them further on that. So if it's a \nspray rig and the spray rig day is on I'll send the two guys who drive the \nspray rig to attend. - Andrew Watson \nThe confidence that their employer has in the employee’s ability to develop skills \nmakes them feel supported and motivated to put the effort in to continue to \nlearn at work. \nAndrew put his trust in me, thought that I could learn and it's been good so \nfar. I quite enjoy it. It's very different. You're just always learning new \nthings. – Employee 2 \nAs the skillsets and workers’ abilities change on farm, Andrew is managing \npeople into roles that get the most out of their experience and ensure their \ncontributions are still valued. Making people feel valued is not only about their \nwork contributions but caring for their wellbeing and enabling them to meet \ncommitments outside of work. The benefit of this approach to people \nmanagement is that it creates a psychological contract such that staff will go that \nextra mile when they are needed at critical peak production times. As Andrew \nstates: \n \nWe encourage anytime they've got family issues, or they want to go and \nwatch the kids run a marathon, or they've got, counselling issues, or \ndoctor’s appointments for their kids, they just let me know and go. They \nhelp work around the problem of them not being there but we work it into \nthe program. School open days, all that stuff. And that means when I need \nsomeone on a weekend, there's no hesitation. \nIt is also through individualised consideration that Andrew encourages team \nmembers to be understanding and supportive of each other. \nWhat's been really important is we have a harmonious team. And you \nalways will have someone a bit out of whack. It just depends on what's \ncausing that, whether they're actually a person who's never going to get on \nwith anyone or whether they are going through a circumstance in their life, \nAnd I guess I do remind them all that pretty much, you've been here long \nenough, I've seen you go through this phase too. – Andrew Watson \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 62 \n \n \nThe workers interviewed for this case study noted the support given and \nreported feeling highly engaged at work, committed to their jobs and happy in \ntheir roles. Different workers at different stages of their career had different \nmotivation at work. With new technology, some only wanted to learn the \nminimum they needed to know to perform their jobs and consequently were only \ninterested in on-the-job learning. Others were keen to develop in their roles and \nengage in external training, looking to bring new ideas back and integrate new \nskills into their job performance. \nTransformational Leadership and Change on Farm \nEach aspect of transformational leadership works to enable staff to adapt to \nchange on farm. This is illustrated in this example given by Andrew: \nInterviewer: And so your current staff, have they adjusted to the changes that \nyou've made on the farm? For example, how do you manage that \nchange? When you brought in the lateral move irrigators, did they \nadjust to that okay? Are they using the available technology or are \nthey even taking an interest in any of this sort of stuff? \nAndrew:  Yes, they all have apps on their phones. The two spray rig operators \nuse our weather stations as a guide to where they should be \nspraying. That gives them the range of whether they're allowed to \ndo that, whether they can be spraying or not (idealised influence of \nperformance standards).  \n An example (of adapting) being the guy who's a trained mechanic \nwas  very interested in laterals and was happy to be the guy who \nlearnt to run them and operate them in my absence (individual \nconsideration).  \n I think they certainly have evolved. I involve them in the discussion \n(inspirational motivation).  \n And they’ll say “well, what about doing it like this?” And you go, \n“Oh, I didn’t think of that?” So we get a bit more horse power out of \npeople, by giving them some incentive, some ideas and some \nexcitement. You know, send them off to Agquip with a list of things \nthey've got to try and find the answer to. (intellectual curiosity) \n \nIn the interviews with workers, it was clear that Andrew’s leadership in \nencouraging workers engagement with technology, by getting them to \ninvestigate and offer feedback, was particularly useful to help them persist in \nlearning new technology. \nTechnology’s not that important to me or the way I go about my job. But it’s \nimportant to Andy and that's probably the thing that counts. I’m pretty hands \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 63 \n \non with things, but I’ll have to learn… For instance, the new irrigation system \nthat Andrew is running. It’s hard to get your head around when you first do \nit but after a while it’s not too bad… I’m just focused on getting my job done \nand that’s all I seem to worry about. But Andrew is always looking  at new \ntechnology and then he’ll ask us to get on the internet and have a look. And \ngive him a bit of feedback about what we think. – Employee 1 \nWell I haven't actually used it yet but Andy used it last year so he'll give me \nthe run down. We'll go from there, we'll probably learn on the go. – \nEmployee 2 \n \nIt comes to Andrew and then he relays it onto us…he's is pretty smart \nAndrew. He does a lot of that (technology investigation) himself. He'll ask \nour opinion. – Employee 3 \n \nHow are workers changing in their jobs on farm? \nI don’t think my job has really changed at all but it's the tools that I can use \nto do the job that have probably changed a bit - Andrew Watson-  \nImmediate factors that are influencing changing priorities for the business \nworkforce strategy can be sorted into three categories: (a) production issues on \nfarm, (b) skills required for automated technology, and (c) location specific \nfactors. Other trends that have the potential to change the workforce required \nfor the farm include the rise of on-farm data management, although the value \nproposition for developing this part of the business has not yet been clearly \nidentified. There is expected to be a gradual increase in the demand for workers \nwho have the skills to thrive in a digital agriculture environment and for growers \nto develop their expertise around integrating digital tools and data management \ninto their existing farm systems. \nProduction Issues for the Farm \nAs well as being guided by the business purpose, the current direction of \nactivities that have direct and indirect workforce implications are in considering \nsolutions for three current production issues including: (a) soil and disease \nconstraints, (b) rainfall management, and (c) labour force management in a \nvariable climate. \nVerticillium wilt was identified as a threat to future cotton crops, and there were \nconcerns that the lateral move irrigation system had contributed to this on farm. \nAs the system offered water savings, and reduced labour requirements compared \nto siphons, it was still seen as useful for the future but would not be expanded \nbeyond what was already in use. It was possible that a corn rotation crop would \nassist with this managing the prevalence of this disease in the cotton crop. If this \ncrop is added to the farm then this changes the value proposition for some \nprecision planting equipment. As Andrew explains:  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 64 \n \n(the corn industry) can show return on investment on better planting \ntechnology. Inherent in the way corn grows is that they've measured it \ndown to the point (plant spacing variation down to 0.1 cms and consequent \nyield loss) they know that in the corn industry. Cotton may be not as exact \nbecause we've got a plant that will compensate for some variations in \nplanting… in the corn industry it is worth upgrading your planter, but it's not \nas apparent in the cotton industry….currently the accepted thinking with the \nlocal research is that corn as a rotation is very important to managing vert. \nSo now we will look to grow corn when we have water. And we'll need to \ninvest in the yield maximization of corn, which as I said to you there is an \nROI on that planter to upgrade. \nAn increased value proposition to upgrade to the precision planter potentially \nadds to the amount of digital technology on farm which impacts the skillset \nrequired for workers. \nThe variable climate has implications for access to water and consequent \nproduction levels on farm. This has motivated cotton growers to explore and \ninvest in technology that can improve water use efficiency such as the \nautomated irrigation systems that are currently used on Kilmarnock. Adding to \nthe value proposition for investment in automated irrigation, the variable climate \nand changing production levels also brings workforce challenges as labour \nrequirements reduce and expand. The most recent severe drought experienced \nacross the eastern states of Australia brought with it challenges for growers to \nhold on to skilled workers. This puts them in a vulnerable position for when rain \nevents occur and production needs to quickly increase. In discussions with \nAndrew, it was revealed that it is not technology that is driving the reduction of \nthe workforce, rather climate is driving the reduction of the workforce due to \nreduced production. He is turning to technology solutions to quickly upscale \noperations when his farm can return to full production. Automation prevents the \npotential restrictions that could occur as a result of  challenges associated with \nfinding the capable and motivated workforce required for increased operations \nwhen the drought breaks.  \nWe have the machinery capability to plant four times what we're planting \nnow, and to harvest that. What we don’t have is the ability to irrigate four \ntimes the crop. Essentially, the way we've now structured this, we would \nonly likely grow twice what we're growing now. We probably still don't have \nthe labour force to grow a crop twice the size of what we are now without a \nbit more investment…. So the opportunity for us now is to look at investing \nin different irrigation systems that coming out of the drought won't require \nthe labour force to do it. Because that will be our single biggest constraint. – \nAndrew Watson \nTechnology is reducing the need to settle for hiring unskilled labour and the \nconsequent pressure of training and assimilating new workers into the team \nduring peak production years. The potential economic savings from having a \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 65 \n \nsmaller, stable workforce as a result of greater automated systems on farm is \nnot so apparent with Andrew noting “it is actually costing us more labour wise \nbecause we've got to go for a higher skilled type of person”.  \nSkills Required for Automated Technology Adoption \nThe skillset required for workers on-farm was changing as new equipment was \nadopted, but this was gradual, and every attempt was made to upskill existing \nworkers and encourage them to persist in learning on the job. A valued \nemployee can have the right attitude and other skills outside of digital agriculture \nproficiency that make them an asset for the farm, but as the business \nstrategically moves towards potentially a smaller workforce, the workforce’s \nadaptability and skill proficiency becomes more important. \nMy underlying theory is if they want to be here and they really want to try, \nyou could probably train most people. And we've certainly kept guys on as \nwe had a broad enough range of jobs that could be done here that there \nwas something that (those less skilled or less adaptable) could do all the \ntime. (But as the skills required and the number of staff employed on farm \nchanges) it certainly means there's a type of person who we probably used \nto employ who now we probably can't afford to. – Andrew Watson \nIn describing this change in technical skill proficiency Andrew described a current \nsituation: \nThe laterals I've got are monitored by our phones. But there's a bit of a \ntechnical thing in setting them up and making them do exactly what I want \nthem to do. I've got one of my guys who can do that, and me. Two of the \nguys might be able to move them out of the way if they need to do farming \noperations but they would struggle to set them up doing what we want to \ndo. And so that's an example of just having guys with enough nous to be \nable to do that. \nThe main tension at the moment is that while workers are increasingly needing \nto have good digital literacy and the skills to work with new technology, they also \nstill need to be willing to do the traditional manual tasks of farm work. \nWhen interviewing the workers, they had noted that the skillsets were changing, \nincreasing the skills required of those in management positions, and potentially \ndecreasing the skillsets required in more straight-forward labour roles (e.g. GPS \nautosteer means people don’t need to develop the manual skills proficiency to \ndrive in straight lines).  \n It's probably for the managers or the whatever, they've got to be up to date \nwith it. Whereas the operator maybe it is decreasing the skills. – Employee 3 \nLocation Specific Factors and Lifestyle \nThe presence of mining in this region means other jobs are available with higher \nwages, although the mining lifestyle was perceived as a drawback particularly for \nworkers in a more established stage of their careers. However, in trying to \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 66 \n \nattract the next generation who are interested in digital technology and in an \nexploration stage, the mines could still be a competitive challenge to attract \ntalented young people. As Andrew explained, there's a definite advantage to \nhaving younger agile minds who are fully immersed in digital technology involved \nin this stuff. But again, they're getting that (the chance to use technology) out at \nthe mines, you know, in a lot of circumstances. \nThe key attraction for each of the workers, younger and older, on Kilmarnock \nwas the life that is working in agriculture, including the variety of tasks, working \noutdoors, the challenge of solving new problems, and the satisfaction of seeing \nthe progress made from their efforts. As employee 3 states:  \nYou're doing something different every day and you're outdoors. It's pretty \nflexible. It's very flexible. Like there's a lot of mining jobs around this area, \nbut it's just doing the same thing every day. Whereas we're doing different \nthings all the time. And it's a bit of a pleasure to see your outcome once you \ndo grow a crop. \nFor an older employee who had owned his own farm and was now involved on \nKilmarnock part-time, his affinity for the lifestyle was linked to the purposeful life \nhe had and continues to lead:  \nI think it was the independence and the self-reliance on myself, and the \nchallenge. You knew that most things as you went along were of your own \ndetermination or volition. If you made a mistake, well you had to wear it, \nand if it wasn’t right you had to change to something else or find a different \nway to do it. – Employee 4 \nSimilarly, the young farm manager was intrinsically motivated in his work by the \nchallenges that farming presents:  \nI don't like doing the same routine all the time. I find that it's boring and \nyou lose, motivation to go to work I think. I like the challenge in farming \nwhere each day a new problem arises and you've got to try and solve it.  \nThe replacement of monotonous tasks with automation, such as the expansion of \nautomated irrigation and reduction of siphon use, and the exploration and \nadoption of new technologies on farm mean that Kilmarnock may be well placed \nto continue to attract people with the problem-solving skills and an openness to \nideas. Recruiting people with these qualities will help the Watsons form a \nworkforce that will adapt to future changes on farm. \nOn-Farm Data Management \nPart of the value proposition of digital technology is the ability for these new \ntools to capture information about inputs and activities involved with growing \ncotton. The measurement of these aspects of production creates an abundance \nof data that may or may not be deemed useful for the business. The complexities \ninvolved with data management either requires a grower to: (a) carve out time \nfrom their current role/responsibilities and develop skills and processes to do this \neffectively, (b) develop someone else within the business to do this, or (c) \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 67 \n \noutsource these tasks similar to the way farming operational tasks can be \noutsourced to contractors. If the usefulness of the full extent of data available \nthrough the technologies becomes apparent, data management skills will become \na priority for cotton farm businesses. Andrew was already considering how to add \nthis skillset to the business with a centralised farm data management platform. \nWhat influences technology adoption for the grower? \nIn relation to the selection of technology on farm, perceived ease of use and \nperceived usefulness were discussed. Andrew’s inherent interest in learning \nabout technology (a motivating factor), and the time it takes him away from \nother tasks associated with his role on farm (noted as a limitation) were also \ndiscussed. Ultimately, the ability to extract sufficient value from the technology \nin comparison with the costs associated was identified as the key driver for \nwhether a technology was initially considered, trialled and adopted. Assessing \nthe return on investment for new technology was complicated due to the many \nfactors that could influence this appraisal. The same technology may have a \ndifferent return on investment depending on the different farm management \nstrategies being used. \nGrower Perceived Ease of Use \nEase of use appraisals centred on three main areas where effort was expected to \nbe required to adopt the technology. This included (a) workforce capability, (b) \nintegration into the existing work structures, and (c) access to support, solutions \nand manual alternatives if the technology fails. \nWorkforce Capability \nAs discussed previously, Andrew is proactive at involving his employees when \nconsidering adopting new technology or machinery that they would be \nresponsible for using. Their skills and confidence to operate the machinery is \nimportant because it is through an adequate performance standard when using \nthe technology that the value of the technology is realised. Use of technology \nmay be limited by employee’s literacy skills whether this is reading ability \n(literacy) or navigation of computer screens (digital literacy). This is further \nexacerbated when new technology has not been designed with the target user’s \nstandard of literacy skills in mind or is complicated in its design. People who are \nvalued members of the team and highly skilled in other machinery operations, \nwho have reading difficulties, could struggle to monitor the machinery and fail to \nrespond to alerts/instructions for actions that need to be taken in the operation \nand servicing of the equipment.  \nLiteracy: \nOne of the difficulties I find is computer screens on tractors now. When you \nstart the tractor up, there's a whole lot of screens come up with (different \nthings that) need to be serviced and if you don't actually read it you miss \nsomething. We've had tractors that have missed services because (an \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 68 \n \noperator who experiences reading difficulties) ticked away on that without \nreading it. –Andrew Watson \n \nDigital Literacy: \nWe do actually talk about that a bit with the staff. If we were to get a \nsystem like that, does anyone think they could run it? We trialled the \nnewest version of this planter . The monitoring screen was incredibly \ncomplicated. It took me a bit to get my head around it and I showed a \ncouple of the other guys and they didn't in the short time we had. What \nworries me then is the screen wouldn't be monitored properly. And the \nadvantage of that stuff is if you manage things to perfection. That's \nessentially what it's all about. – Andrew Watson \n \nWith regards to the potential to add a central data management platform to be \nused for farm management, Andrew discussed the specific skill set that may \nneed to be outsourced from his existing workforce capacity. The transferable \nskills of his bookkeeper was a potential solution, but he also noted her skillset \nwas in demand and she may not have the capacity to take on more work.  \nIs it really to the point where I upgrade and get my bookkeeper to do more \nin terms of this stuff? Because that's one of the most highly qualified people \non this farm. She's been a chartered accountant for 20 years and she comes \noff a farm. She gets it all and has an amazing ability to coordinate things. \nWhen I'm talking about this (data management) program, maybe that \nwould be something that she could take over and run for me. So that's \nthinking outside the box a bit. I don’t just need guys in tractors, I need a \nbusiness run. At the moment the squeaky point at the top of the bottle is \nme. How much I can do and how much I can get other people to help me do \nthat? – Andrew Watson \nIntegration into the Existing Work Structures \nOne of the challenging things about developing the skills required to operate new \nmachinery required for different task performance on farm, is the seasonal \nnature of these tasks. Tasks may only need to be performed at certain times of \nthe year which can make it difficult to get the sustained practice required to \ncommit new processes to memory or integrate new skills into existing \nrepertoires.  The more intuitive and easier it is to operate and integrate the \ntechnology into the legacy systems on farm, the more it will be seen as a useful \naddition to the farm. Additionally, if the technology is adding to the existing \nworkload and is not easy to integrate by adding another task demand, there may \nbe barriers to seeing the usefulness of such an addition to the farm business. The \nspecific example discussed with Andrew was in management of farm data.  \nFor me, someone who looks at that data (and uses those) techniques once a \nyear, I just don't remember, you know. I've had it explained to me. I've \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 69 \n \ndownloaded one year's worth of my header yield data from whatever crops \nwe're harvesting and got it transferred through. I just don't remember how \nto do it every year because it's something you look at once a year. And \nthere'll be a certain amount of, to my mind, illogical steps. There's a \nfrustration for me in having all these multiple sources of really good \ninformation, but not having an easy way to combine them somewhere. – \nAndrew Watson \nData management was made more complex by using different system providers \n(e.g. not all machinery was John Deere) and the lack of interoperability between \nsystems acting as a barrier to central data storage. Finding an adequate solution \nis not easy to do. Andrew was actively considering solutions and could see the \npotential value of technology other farmers were using to manage their data but \nthe time involved to adopt and use this sort of technology was a major factor in \nworking through the value proposition.  \n(Some farmers I know) have a great big screen with all their enterprises, \nwith their current gross margin up to date blinking at them every day. This \nis what's working on their farm. That is some more technology which I'm \nlooking at if it's worth the money. We’re just tiptoeing our way through that \none a bit. It's got to be all me doing it. And I'm not just sure whether I've \ngot the time to devote to that. – Andrew Watson \nAccess to Support, Solutions and Manual Alternatives \nBeyond being able to use technology, ease of use also hinges on how quickly a \nsolution can be found to keep work on track if something goes wrong with the \ntechnology. This means considering how simple the technology is to fix, \naccessibility to support for repairs, and if there is an easily implemented second \noption to continue work on tasks. These factors were mainly discussed in \ncomparing recent investments in two different automated irrigation systems: the \nlateral move irrigators, and the Large Pipe Through Bank systems.  \nAn experience with one of the lateral move irrigators had been a source of \nfrustration, when it broke down at Christmas time (a peak time for irrigation \nactivities on the farm). The complexity of the machinery means it was not \npossible to diagnose the issue remotely and then fix with instruction over the \nphone. \nI've always had a pretty good relationship with all the mechanics who are \npart of the service industry and their bosses, I talk to a lot of people. On \nChristmas Eve, it stopped. There are seven wires that run from one end of \nthe machine to the other. So the signalling capability of them telling me \nexactly what's causing it is (very) difficult. – Andrew Watson \nThe risks associated with this machinery was not only through technical faults. \nThese lateral move irrigators, you have to irrigate pretty much all the time. \nSo you've got about a day and a half or two days grace before it next needs \nto be irrigated…. If you get it bogged, it's three days just to let it dry out to \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 70 \n \nget it out. So we've identified those as risks. We're certainly working on \nways to deal with bogging, we’re learning every year about what can  go \nwrong. – Andrew Watson \nWith this system there is no alternate approach that could be implemented to \nensure irrigation happens as scheduled. This is contrasted with the Large Pipe \nThrough Bank system, where a manual work- around solution if the automation \nfails is possible. \nVery simply, so the worst case, the channel breaks, I've got excavators. \nNext stage, the automation part of it breaks, no problems, It's a winding \nhandle. You wind the handle to shut a gate. So it just means someone's \ngoing to get up at midnight to do the shift rather than programming it to do \nit automatically in the middle of the night.  So realistically there’s very little \nissues relating around that. So that's why, these are the big reasons I'm \nheading towards this. – Andrew Watson \nThe simpler and less complicated technology is, the less effort is required to \novercome barriers to adoption and effective use, and the easier it is to follow \nthrough with adoption. These ease-of-use factors are part of what is considered \nto determine the usefulness and relative advantage of adopting a new technology \non this farm. \nGrower Perceived Usefulness \nPerceived usefulness is based around the perceived relevance of certain \ntechnology to the farm in terms of overcoming barriers to achieving production \ngoals, and whether the technology provides a relative advantage in the \neffectiveness of prioritised performance areas on the farm. Alignment with the \nfarm business strategy, exposure through social learning networks to better \nunderstand the context of what makes ag-tech useful, and the presence of \ngovernment rebates all influence a grower’s assessment of whether investment \nand adoption of a technology is useful for their farm. Independent specialist \nsupport to determine ROI is also valued. \nThere's also a real industry around proving how that stuff does make \nreturns and I support that. At least they're trying to prove some return on \ninvestment. – Andrew Watson \n \nInterest in Ag-tech that is a Strategic Fit for the Farm. \nWhether the technology is addressing a prioritised ‘pain point’ for Andrew’s \nfarming operation was an important determinant of whether it was considered \nuseful at that point in time. For example, more investment in data collection and \ndata management was not a priority because it was unclear how this could be \nuseful beyond what is already known regarding the farm. \nThere's a lack (of capacity to take on this task at the moment). Is it yield \nconstraining? At the moment, I don't think so. Thirty years' experience with \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 71 \n \nthis farm tells me we haven't got the variation across our fields that relates \nto something I can do something about, other than disease. We can manage \nit because I know that field is a bit red, so we irrigate it differently to that \nfield, which is a bit black, I know that stuff. \nI've got history to teach me that and I’ve got my father still here to also \nteach me that. So yes, there's an ability to do more technical stuff. There's \nprobably a lack of time and possibly lack of will. You know, if I had a son \nwho was 21 right now who was very interested, they'd probably be driving \nthat stuff all the way. – Andrew Watson \n \nAndrew’s acknowledgement about the next generation driving the investigation \nand potential adoption of digital agriculture was based on the level of interest \nassociated with digital technologies and computers that is demonstrated by \nyounger generations. Interest does drive attention and an openness to trying to \nfind the usefulness or value of ag-tech. Andrew noticed his own interests had \nshifted over the years to focusing in on ag-tech that could strategically \nstrengthen the farm business’s profitability, rather than what was simply new or \ninnovative. \nBack in my late thirties, I was happy to be seen to be an innovator. I'm less \ninterested in that now. I'm probably doing what I'm doing now more based \non proper observed need rather than the sexiness of it. Maybe that's just a \nmaturing of things, and a bit of experience too. - Andrew Watson \nOther than improvements to profitability, technology that facilitated team \nperformance was also valued. Strategically, Andrew has prioritised the effective \nmanagrment of his employees to work as a cohesive team in the pursuit of \nproduction goals.. This meant that a work organisation platform, in this instance \nTrello, was a useful addition to the farm.  \nTrello is a job management app where I list the jobs. Everyone can access \nit. If they see the jobs and the photo, and their initials there, they know \nthat's their job. And when they finish, they slide across to another board so \nthat I can go and check it and see it has been done. – Andrew Watson \n \nSocial learning and Observing in Context to Assess Benefits of Ag-tech \nSocial influences were important in terms of being connected to a knowledge \nnetwork that could share information and examples of how technology was \nuseful in farming business. \nDigital ag… I reckon there's a healthy set of scepticism in Australian cotton \nas to the actual value of all this sexy stuff. Yes it sounds good, but \nrealistically, what's that translate to in terms of gross margin? I've just been \nto the States and seen a guy there whose quite large farm was set up so \nthat every application of anything, seed, fertilizer, spray, was controlled by \nhis computer. All his staff had to do was drive to the paddock and tell the \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 72 \n \nGPS what field they're in and that would set the seeding rate in the \nplanter….And so, you know, that is probably right at the cutting edge, some \nwould argue the bleeding edge, of where digital technology is on a broad \nscale. It's the ultimate variable rate everything. - Andrew Watson \nReal world examples with context specific information could help Andrew assess \nthe likelihood of something working within his own business. Different \napproaches to farm management meant that different technologies that Andrew \nadmires, may not be cost effective or useful at this time as they don’t fit with the \nstrategy that is being used to conserve resources or inputs. \nI love what Karin Stark down at Trangie is (doing) with that stuff (solar \npowered pumping of water). It’s brilliant. I know a couple of the guys that \nare doing it. I've got a significant interest in it. I'm struggling to make it \nwork with our current (water conservation) systems (which are not based \naround filling a dam in winter with water to use in summer). - Andrew \nWatson \nThe relative advantage for changing water management strategies was not \napparent currently and consequently this solar powered technology was not a \npriority for adoption. \nGovernment incentives \nEconomic influences in the form of government incentives does influence the \nvalue proposition for adoption of ag-tech. In discussing the farm tour in the USA, \nAndrew noted the subsidies that offset the costs associated with the precision \nagriculture systems being used that are not offered in the Australian context. \nAnd the US have got a whole lot of funded soil sampling stuff, which can tie \ninto that you know, ultra-fine grided soil sampling. There's a healthy degree \nof skepticism over here about is it worth doing that? - Andrew Watson \n \nWhile it was the millennium drought which acted as the catalyst to begin \nexploring the use of automated irrigation systems, the government Murray-\nDarling Buyback Scheme helped to overcome economic barriers that can prevent \ninvestment in incorporating automated irrigation technology on farm.   The \nintegration of automated irrigation solutions would have been realised without \nthis scheme, but the economic incentives can accelerate investment in \ntechnology adoption and help growers when a large capital outlay is involved. \nWhat influences workers acceptance of new technology on farm? \nOn Kilmarnock, the transformational leadership practices Andrew used were a \ncontributing factor to keeping workers engaged while implementing change on \nfarm, including adoption of new technology. Full time and part time team \nmembers employed in a range of roles including general farm management, \nmachinery operation and maintenance, and general farm hand duties were \ninterviewed to gain more insights into their experiences of adapting in their roles, \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 73 \n \nlearning to use new equipment, and their attitudes about digital agriculture. \nUsing the technology acceptance model to frame the investigation, perceptions of \nease of use and usefulness were discussed.  \nInterviewer: What makes a technology a good technology? \nEmployee 1: Just the way it goes about its tasks, whether it’s user friendly \nand some creature comforts. Ease of use for the operator and whether it’s \ngot the right bits and pieces that we need for the job. \nThese appraisals can be further understood through the factors of (a) social \ninfluence, (b) cognitive appraisals of job relevance, output quality and results \ndemonstrability, (c) general beliefs about useability of computer systems, (d) \ndirect experiences, (e) age, and (f) digital literacy and self-efficacy. \nWorker Perceived Ease of Use \nThe factors of age, computer self-efficacy, digital literacy and technical operation \nskills all contributed to appraisals of perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use \nis then one of the contributors to appraisals of perceived usefulness; the easier a \ntechnology is to use, the less obstacles exist that must be overcome and \ntherefore a clearer path to usefulness exists. \nInterviewer:  Do you ever find that any of the technology makes your job \nmore complicated? \nEmployee 2: Not really. At first you think it does, but the more you get to \nuse it, the more you learn about it, the easier it becomes. You realise that it \nis more help than a hindrance. \n \nAge \nThere is a stereotype that older people are less adaptive and less able to adopt \nnew technology but discussions with participants and past research would \nsuggest that the relationship between age and technology adoption is more \nnuanced than this (Hauk, Huffmeier, & Krumm, 2018). While some older workers \non farm may proclaim their lack of adaptability is due to being older, for them \nacceptance and adoption of technology may be more related to digital literacy \nand self-efficacy to learn computer-based systems than actual age. Of course, \nage may be linked to a lack of exposure to technology that leads to digital \nliteracy, (e.g. no computers when school age and therefore less mandatory \ninteraction), but in this instance age is a confounding variable not the cause. \nOlder worker’s ability to engage with new technology could be impacted by the \ndegeneration of some physical and cognitive abilities associated with aging that \ncan impact ease of use; particularly the interaction between poorer eyesight with \nscreen and text size, and self-reported attention and memory decline with \nlearning new tasks. People experience ageing differently and while these \ncharacteristics may be present for one older worker, they may not be present for \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 74 \n \nanother older worker. Technology designed to allow for diverse user experience \ncould help to overcome these barriers to adoption.  \nComments on eyesight: \nEmployee 4: I find with the phone I’m not as proficient at using that. Being \nable to use it yeah what all the things you’ve got to do to go into those \nthings. Um  \nInterviewer: Do you think the computer is better than the phone? \nEmployee 4: I think there you could sit there and look at the screen and \nhave a whole great big screen to look at to read up about things. And \nwhereas the phone you’ve only got it on a small scale. I think that’s a bit \neasier because of the large size of the screens and that helps. My eyesight’s \nnot like it used to be. The desktop computer is much easier to read. \nComments on attention and memory: \nI suppose it’s an older age thing … I’m not as quick as what I used to be. It \nsort of comes back to memory things and difficulty with concentration and \nthat. But you know, it might be different for different people. I think that’s \nwhat I’m finding… it’s how good I am at remembering and learning. \nComputer Self-efficacy, Digital Literacy and Technical Operation Skills \nWorkers’ computer self-efficacy, digital literacy, and technical operation skills \ninfluenced their appraisals of ease-of-use. \nI'm not computer literate really. It's hard, I'm going to try and steer away \nfrom that as much as I can. (My job) is changing, I still do limited things, \nand it’s a challenge. Andrew gives us a bit of a rundown to start off with and \nthen it's just, have a play yourself and try and work it out from there. It's \npretty simple the stuff we've got on farm to be honest, it's just like apps \nand that. It's not too bad…. on this farm, it just seems to be very simple like \nthe moisture probes. And for our day to day running we've got an app called \nTrello, where we put jobs that need to be done. Yeah. It seems to be pretty \nsimple. – Employee 1 \n \nWe like things simple. If it looks too hard we’ll just say we don’t like it. He \n(Andrew) will make his decision (to purchase new equipment) on that sort \nof basis. ---decisions are made mutually…. I think the most challenging \nthings are the aspects when Andy decides to upgrade things to more \ntechnical things that he's got his head around but we haven’t as yet. – \nEmployee 1 \nComputer self-efficacy is an individual’s belief that they are capable to organise \nand execute actions required to achieve desired outcomes from operating \ncomputer-based systems. It is an influential factor that motivates people to \nengage in attempting to use new systems and persist in applying effort, \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 75 \n \nconfident that they will succeed. As illustrated above, the less confident, the \nmore workers will ‘try and steer away from that as much as I can’, whereas this \nworker then goes on to explain that the computer and digital based tools they \nhave on farm have been used successfully, giving them confidence they can use \n‘simple’ technologies. Ensuring successful experiences occur to build team \nmembers self-efficacy is important for adoption of future technology. The more \nconfident an individual, the more they will engage in experiences that develop \ntheir digital literacy and the less likely they are to find new on-farm technology \n‘looks too hard’ and ‘just say we don’t like it’. \nOther factors that influence self-efficacy include verbal persuasion (getting \nencouragement that they could learn and perform the task), and vicarious \nexperience (seeing fellow team members learn and perform tasks). However, \nthese could be discounted if people did not have past performance experiences \nto draw on (e.g., “that worker can do that because they’re ‘technology savvy’ \nand I’m not”). Getting people started with simpler technologies closer to their \ncurrent abilities and working to develop skills and confidence as they master \nthese technologies is important. \nDespite some workers proclaiming lower confidence in using digital technologies, \nall workers interviewed possessed some digital literacy skills. Within Australian \nagriculture, digital literacy has been defined as “the ability to acquire and \nmaintain a basic awareness and knowledge of current and emerging technologies \nimpacting on the agriculture industry” (KPMG Consulting & Skills Impact, 2019).  \nFarm managers were more likely to be self-initiating in looking up new trends in \nfarming on the internet. For all workers, Andrew was encouraging them to \nextend their digital literacy by asking them to investigate digital equipment and \nmachinery for potential adoption. People were more engaged if the technology \nwas used in an area of interest and relevancy to them. For example, a machinery \noperator clearly described his online search strategy to solve problems with \nequipment.  \nInterviewer: Have you ever had to search for an answer to a problem \nonline? If so, how do you go about it? \nEmployee 1: We just type in what the machine invoice it's got serial \nnumbers and so forth. And we just type in a serial number and have a look \nsee what it is and then we scroll on different things just to get to that site, \njust to give you a bit of a rundown of what other people have actually \ndiscovered. \nOn the farm, different equipment can look very different in terms of the screen \nlayout, requiring different keystrokes, or processes to use it effectively. \nDeveloping general digital literacy and computer self-efficacy helps navigate and \nswitch between systems and technology from different providers. An absence of \ndigital literacy and computer self-efficacy can mean it looks difficult.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 76 \n \nMost of it looks like it's complicated and hard to get your head around to \nuse because we use all different machinery and every different machine \ntakes a very different technique to use. – Employee 3 \nHaving a sufficient baseline of digital capabilities is required for people to \nindependently work on developing their technology operation skills. The following \nexample is a worker whose digital literacy and computer self-efficacy helps him \nto switch between operating systems, integrate the advice and instruction he is \ngiven to reach a new level of skill in his machinery operation. \nInstead of the tractor driving in a straight line, I got it to turn corners, come \nback in another straight line and go again. I knew how to do it on a different \nGPS but didn't know how to do it on this one.  But I talked to one of the \ngurus in town and he sort of talked me through it and once he got me \nthrough it I was like 'yeah that tractor there is pretty similar'. I'm learning \nmore things about the GPS pretty much every day really. – Employee 2 \nFacilitating Conditions and Self-directed Learners \nAndrew’s connector manager style, as previously described, also meant every \nattempt was made for conditions on the farm to facilitate workers acceptance \nand adoption of the selected technology. Workers felt more favourably about \ntechnology when they were able to access support, where clear instructions, \nadvice and help finding answers, was given. Ultimately, the workers bear \nresponsibility for the effort applied to integrate new skills into their existing \nskillsets. The faster they could do this, the less mistakes and errors made, which \ncan negatively impact the perceived usefulness of technology. \nInterviewer: What was the most challenging aspect about bringing that \ntechnology into work? \nEmployee 1: For us to program correctly. We got shown by the person that \ninstalled the devices originally and then Andy showed us once after that and \nthen we had to work it out. It's one of those things if you haven't got it right \nand something happens in the middle of the night and you’re still pumping \nwater but they don't open it’s going to go somewhere. \nBeing motivated self-directed learners is an important part of a workforce \nadapting to an ever-changing farm work environment. Having the skills to keep \nup with changes to reduce the challenge associated with learning and reducing \nthe perceived complexity of digital technology will mean it is easier to use and \naccept/adopt. \nWorker Perceived Usefulness \nSocial Influence \nAndrew’s leadership practices set up social norms for workers to engage in \nexploring and learning about new technology when this was not necessarily \nsomething they were interested in or intrinsically motivated to do.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 77 \n \nEmployee 1: I don't really, don’t pay attention to it until Andy asks us about \nit…It is more surface stuff (when learning to use it) but yeah we usually \ndon’t dig too far sort of things, Andy does, but us workers don’t \nThe new farm manager (less than 2 years with the team) was in a growth stage \nof his career. At this stage he was interested in learning more about new \ndevelopments in farming. This meant that within the team there was a potential \n‘champion’ for adopting new tools or approaches to work. Even for him, learning \nand accepting new approaches to farming was best delivered in a context where \nideas could be discussed with respected peers. \nI don't like to learn online. I don't think I take enough in.  I like to actually \ntalk to people face to face.  And to have others in the room, and you get a \nfew farmers, and everyone talks about different things. About how they've \ndone different things.  I think that's how you learn the most. \nResearch has shown social influence is particularly important for technology \nacceptance in settings where changes are mandatory (Venkatesh and Bala, \n2008). Resistance to ideas from other farming contexts from within the team \ncomes from struggling to see the usefulness of new approaches that have not \nbeen adequately proven from their viewpoint. \nAndy gets on Twitter and Instagram and everybody's doing those things all \nover in the States. But the States is completely different to here. The \nfarming practices can be the same but what soil types and environmental \nconditions and so forth are completely different in this part of the world. – \nEmployee 1 \nHaving a person within the team who will support the grower by championing the \nchange and technology adoption has a positive influence on others that are more \nestablished and less flexible in changing their approach to work. \nEmployee 1: Doesn't come easy for me, because I'm set in my ways but \neventually, I do come around to change. Andy will tell you that. \nInterviewer: What helps bring you around to change? \nEmployee 1: Say one of the other workmates comes and says yeah that's a \ngood thing, that sort of change was a good thing then I might sit back and \ntake a longer and better look at it in the long run it probably does send a \nsignal that change is probably better, it takes a while longer \nJob Relevancy: Does it support important tasks in my job? \nAndrew had been selective in the technology introduced to farm. This coupled \nwith his efforts to develop individuals’ expertise to use technology in areas of \npersonal interest and strengths, meant that most workers saw the technology on \nthe farm as helpful and relevant to their job.  \nEverything that we use helps you do your job more than anything else. – \nEmployee 1 \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 78 \n \nOne of the farm managers spoke about the usefulness of technology in relation \nto tasks that were central to his role (a) making decisions about watering, and \n(b) managing the distribution of work to other team members. He was clear that \nthe technology was not replacing these tasks, but it did provide value by \nsupporting the performance of important tasks in his job. \nOn soil moisture probes: \nOne of the biggest things is irrigating and getting the water going at the \nright time so you're not stressing the crop out too much. The use of \nmoisture probes, that's value adding. They're giving us a better \nunderstanding of what we need to do with the watering.  \n \nOn Trello: \nWhen it's there you can just go through it and give people jobs and go and \ndo jobs yourself and tick them off. It is very handy. You still have got to \ndouble check it to make sure it's been done right. So, there's still a bit of \nhands on. I still think there is value in it. \nFor the part-time worker, who is employed to do a variety of jobs as needed on \nthe farm, the Trello system was seen as job relevant. It was an easy way for him \nto stay informed of where he may be needed on farm. \nYeah it’s good because he puts things on it and when you’re looking to do \nsomething, I look up this Trello. And if it’s something that falls into my \ncategory of experience I’ll have a go at doing it. That’s a good thing \nbecause, you’re more or less putting on the phone a list of things that have \nto be done, should be done or got to be done \nWorkers did not see the relevance of all the digital capability of machinery. For \nexample, for one worker, even though the machinery they used collected data, it \nwas only engaged with to the extent that it might be of interest in a brief \nappraisal of a past performance outcome – what did I achieve? This was surface \nlevel engagement and was not linked to future performance. It is an example of \ndigital agriculture being used only in ways that are seen as relevant to the \nindividual. \nEmployee 1: Two piece in the tractor collects data. But we don't go into the \ndepths of going back into it and looking at it. The only one do we get back \ninto is yields. Just look back in the computer and see what yields you did \nthe previous time or something like that but yeah.  \nInterviewer: Does that help you in your job or is that just more sort of \ncuriosity? \nEmployee 1: Yeah. It’s more curiosity \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 79 \n \nOutput Quality: Does it do a job to the standard I currently do, or better? \n \nTechnology was seen as particularly useful if it helped overcome skills deficits. \nFor example, the GPS in the tractor was accepted by all staff as useful for the \nprecision it bought to machinery operation \nInterviewer: And what are the parts of your job where using technology \nreally sort of helps you? \nEmployee 2: Lines in tractors. I can't drive in a straight line to save my \nlife.  \nIt is interesting to note, that for some workers who were highly skilled in manual \nmachinery operation, further application of GPS to tractor operation was seen as \nunnecessary and not useful for their farm. While the GPS-assisted turning may \nbe performing a job-relevant task, their response reflects the question, ‘is it \nworth the effort to learn a different way to do something they can already \nproficiently do manually?’ \nThe (operator) can actually just sit there and the tractor will turn itself at \nthe end of the row. You don't have to actually turn the tractor. I can't see it \nbeing a use for us. I can see a use for those people further west. Big \ndryland growers especially, who will probably put backpackers or something \non their gear and they're just really there to watch. – Employee 3 \nTo achieve output quality, workers need skills associated with adapting the \ntechnology to their environmental context. For example, with the recent \ntransition of some of the land to utilise the Large Pipe Through the Bank \nirrigation system, the farm manager was still working through exactly what \nadjustments needed to be made to improve the output quality of this system. \nI'm pretty happy with the bit that I've done, but then in between each \npadman stop we've got to improve that. They haven't gone out far enough \ninto the paddock. \nWhen the output quality of a technology is observed, the relative advantage is \napparent, and it is seen as useful. However, challenging environmental \nconditions can be barriers to the output quality of this technology \nWhen the laterals are running well, I’d say, yeah, it gives you a chance to \ngo and do something else….. (The lateral), they do get bogged and they do \nget out of alignment. So, yeah it can be time consuming just as much as the \nold way we used to do it, which was siphons. – Employee 1 \nWith technology, the output quality needs to be achieved as consistently as \npossible, otherwise it starts to negatively impact appraisals of the relative \nadvantage and obscure the demonstrability of results. \nResults Demonstrability and Relative Advantage \nThe desired result of adopting technology is to make gains in efficiency and \neffectiveness of work on farm. Therefore, when discussing the demonstrable \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 80 \n \nresults of technology, workers talked about the relative advantage of the new \ntools they had to perform their jobs compared to the old methods or tools. These \nwere discussed in relation to (a) personal performance improvements, (b) \nreduced job demands, (c) greater team cohesion, and (d) achieving farm goals. \nPersonal Performance Improvements \nIf the technology can improve performance by ensuring tasks are performed with \ngreater accuracy, in less time, and less effort then it delivers an advantage over \nprior approaches to task performance.  \nI did take on the GPS guided system. I’ve always been a bit that way with \nthe technology because I could see the efficiencies and precision that they \nbring about to what you’re doing. And therefore, they can ultimately be cost \nsaving. Yes, these technology things are a worthwhile thing for doing a \nbetter job. – Employee 4 \nThe tractor GPS. I think that has improved in the way we do farming as in \nyou can do things nice and straight. That sort of thing has made us a bit \nbetter. – Employee 3 \nInstead of going through a worksheet to work out chemical rates and how \nmuch water and what speed you work at, this app will do it for you, makes \nyour job just easier and faster than the old school way. – Employee 1 \nReduced Job Demands \nRelative advantage may also be related to better recovery time and less physical \nstress for workers, or less cognitive load in remembering what needs to be done. \nSiphons are ok, I don't mind them, but these guys have been doing them \nfor 20 years and hate them. (the automated irrigation) will be less physical, \nit will probably be more time efficient. You don't have to be out half the \nnight, get home at 5am. – Employee 2 \n(With Trello) it helps you remember, like sometimes you just drive past \nsomething and think, oh I'll put that on Trello and that way you know it will \nget done. – Employee 1 \nTeam Cohesion \nIf the technology helps to facilitate a better organised team and effective \ncommunication about priority work, then that is useful to the workforce. \nYeah, it can be very useful. It's better than writing it down on whiteboard \nthen everyone just does their own thing. Where on Trello, a job can get put \non there, and it can get assigned to one worker to fulfill that job… It's \nhelpful in… especially with the ones that have got to be priority jobs. – \nEmployee 3 \nAchieving Farm Goals \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 81 \n \nThe technology is useful if it achieves results that benefit the farm. For example, \nautomated irrigation primarily is useful for water-use efficiency and reducing \nlabour. However, assessing the relative advantage may not always be a \nstraightforward appraisal when comparing two systems. For example, balancing \nthe benefits of water saving versus ease of use, may mean that the relative \nadvantage of one system over the other is unclear. \nWell, if the lateral has a water saving, it's got to be better. But the padman \nstop, well, I suppose it's pretty easy like, you just got to set your timers on \nthe gates and they open and shut. I reckon, I don't know \n… having a lateral there instead of having a siphon over the bank you got \nlateral with another engine on it which is another mouth to feed with diesel. \n(It costs) a lot of money in infrastructure, in earthworks, for those laterals \nand the pivot. So I really don’t know whether it's a big saving it’s all cracked \nup to be. – Employee 3 \nWhile assessing the economic advantage of technology is not a responsibility of \nthe staff members, understanding if there is an economic advantage that serves \nthe sustainability goals of the farm, and consequently a perceived usefulness of \nthe technology, may still assist with technology acceptance. For some \ntechnology, it may not be until the initial effort to integrate it into the system \nand the results are observed that acceptance occurs. \nIt was actually good once we got it all up and running. No more siphons in \nthose paddocks, yeah just the ease of it. – Employee 1 \nSummary and Conclusion \nThis case study contributes to a greater understanding of factors influencing the \nfuture of work, change processes, technology adoption, and workforce \nacceptance and engagement with new technology. Main findings of this case \nstudy include: \n• Workforce development and strategic adoption of technology are \nintegrated into a larger strategic vision for the farm business \n• Transformational leadership is influential on workforce acceptance of \ntechnology, skill development and effective use of new technology on farm \n• Psychological safety has positive implications for the learning environment \non farm \n• A connector manager approach can reduce the demands on the employer \nto support workforce in technical aspects of their roles by distributing \nexpertise through the team and extending networks of support. \n• Factors that impact the workforce strategy on farm include, the presence \nof production issues that can be solved with technology solutions, a \nconsequent change in skillset from adoption of new technology, location \nspecific factors and increasing demand for on-farm data management. \n• Ease-of-use factors associated with technology are important for assessing \nthe value proposition and these considerations include workforce \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 82 \n \ncapability, integration into the existing work structures, and access to \nsupport, solutions, and manual alternatives if the technology fails. \n• The grower’s perceived usefulness appraisals are supported by a clear \nvalue proposition associated with solving a production limiting problem \nand social learning opportunities. \n• Workers experiences of ease-of-use were impacted by their computer self-\nefficacy, digital literacy, and technical skills, as well as the supports \noffered to them when learning to use the technology. \n• Ease-of-use, job relevancy, the quality of the work achieved through \ntechnology use, and the relative advantage the technology offered in \nterms of their performance, reducing job demands and achieving the farm \ngoals contributed to workers perceptions of usefulness for technology \nFarm management strategies, workforce structure and capability, and technology \nadoption interrelate and impact on each other. Transformational leadership, a \npsychologically safe work environment, and connector manager approaches to \nbuilding workforce capacity were identified as mechanisms by which growers \nmay encourage their workforce to adapt and remain engaged when change \noccurs on farm. \nCurrent production issues were the impetus for the application of time and effort \nto find potential digital agriculture solutions and investigating new technology. \nMajor arguments for adopting irrigation have focused on labour saving costs and \nhave consequently led to some to lament a loss of jobs and negative community \nimpacts. However, the current investigation found that it is the workforce supply \ndemands and production challenges created because of boom/bust weather \ncycles that is central to the motivation to automate. Automated irrigation offers \nthe opportunity to restructure the workforce to be smaller, but more highly \nskilled, and with better work conditions than in the past. The challenge is that \nwhile systems are not fully automated, workers need to be willing to upskill but \nto also engage in the traditional manual labour approaches. Even if fully \nautomated, the technology may not be so reliable that backup manual \napproaches are not still required at times.  \nWorkforce capability, in particular computer self-efficacy, general literacy, digital \nliteracy, and being motivated, self-directed learners influenced the ease with \nwhich technology was accepted and adopted and impacted whether the \ntechnology would be used proficiently and be deemed useful. Social learning and \nobserving and experiencing the use of technology in contexts that could be easily \ncompared with the individuals’ farm work environment, helped to determine the \nrelative advantage of making a change. Having a team mate to persuade those \nthat might otherwise deem it too much effort to proceed (a champion for the new \ntechnology) could help workers persist until they overcame the learning curve \nrequired to integrate new ways of working into their role on farm. A number of \nfactors, including job relevancy, output quality, and results demonstrability, are \ncentral to convincing workers of the value proposition and accepting new \ntechnology on farm.   \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 83 \n \nChapter Four: Sundown Pastoral Company: \nEntrepreneurs and Intrapreneurs Creating \nthe Future of the Cotton Industry \nIntroduction \nI think it’s important to keep it clear that we’re not just farmers, it’s not just \nabout a crop. We’re about a whole of supply chain and about technology and \ndifferent looking/thinking outside the box.  – Danielle Statham \nDavid and Danielle Statham are owners and directors of Sundown Pastoral \nCompany which encompasses two agricultural properties that grow cotton; \nKeytah located West of Moree and St Ronan’s in North Eastern Queensland. \nKeytah, is 24,625 hectares with 4,996 hectares allocated for cattle and \ncropping/grass for cattle production, 6,053 hectares allocated to dry land crop \nproduction, and 10,980 hectares allocated for irrigated crop production. While \ncotton is the focal commodity, wheat, faba beans and chickpeas are also grown, \nand some cattle kept. At the time of our interview, February 2020, this region \nwas in severe drought and in the most recent season only 3,021 hectares of \ndryland cotton had been grown and harvested. In the previous year, 2019, the \ncompany had purchased St Ronan’s, a property spanning 44,000 hectares and \nhad developed 4,211 hectares of this for cropping production. \nKeytah is well known for hosting research and development activities. Most \nrecently, longitudinal trials of different irrigation systems and their successful \nadoption of digital agricultural approaches to farm and crop management have \nfeatured in the 2020 Australian Cotton Production Manual. The Statham’s have a \nreputation as leading innovators in the cotton industry and this extends beyond \nthe farm gate with the establishment of their Good Earth Cotton™ business and \nsupply chain traceability solution FibreTrace™. \nSundown Pastoral Company is a family business with a corporate-like structure. \nPeople are directly employed or contracted by the business.  Core staff \nhighlighted on the company website have been associated with the Stathams and \ntheir business in various roles for between 12 – 33 years. The exception is a \ndedicated IT manager who has been with the company for the last 4 years and a \nspecial projects manager who has assisted with company diversification over the \npast 3 years. With the focus of the case study on the future of the cotton \nindustry, David and Danielle, and three key Sundown Pastoral team members \nwere interviewed. Nick Gillingham is the General Manager of Cropping Operation \nand has worked with the company since 2005, originally starting out as the farm \nagronomist under his own business NG Agronomic Consultancy. Wil Jackman is \nthe agronomy assistant under NG Agronomic Consultancy and originally started \nworking with Sundown Pastoral Company in 2008 as an irrigation contractor. \nNathanial Phillis who now is employed as the Irrigation Operations Manager has \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 84 \n \nthe longest standing association of the three employees interviewed, having \noriginally joined the Sundown Pastoral team in 1997 as a contract irrigator. All \nthree of these people are trusted and valued team members and able to work \nwith considerable autonomy. With this case study, David and Danielle discussed \ntheir entrepreneurial approach to business and the culture of innovation they \nhave established. The team members interviewed at Sundown indicated that \nthey work in a way where they can be viewed as intrapreneurs - active players \nthat shape the future of the farm and behave innovatively within the work \nstructures established. Insights offered within this case study include \n• How do the entrepreneurs strategically plan and adapt to change in \nfarming? \n• How do the entrepreneurs create the innovative work environment, \ndevelop the skills and workforce capability, and the structures required to \nbe at the cutting edge of industry? \n• What strategic decisions have been made recently that have changed the \nbusiness and what does this mean for the workforce? \n• How do the entrepreneurs view the future of the cotton industry and what \nis needed? \nHow do the entrepreneurs strategically plan and adapt to change in \nfarming? \nThe adaption process within the farming business is influenced by the growers \napproach to personal development, and their evolving strategic vision for the \nbusiness. \nPersonal Development \nWhen discussing their personal development, both David and Danielle gave \nexamples of formal education and training but particularly emphasised the \nlearning opportunities they had in (a) past business endeavours, (b) investigative \nexperiences and (c) the sharing of knowledge through reciprocal relationships \nthat formed their extensive networks.  \nPast Business Endeavours \nThe transferable lessons from direct experience outside of agriculture have \ndeveloped different skillsets and knowledge that can be then applied to a farming \nbusiness. Simultaneously learning about farming from the ground up has meant \nthat they have the expertise to discern what new skills will work within the \nagricultural context. \nLearning about sales, it’s a completely different business outside agriculture \nbut all the concepts are the same. The importance of people, the importance \nof the sale, the importance of the supply chain, the importance of \ntechnology and systems. I took all of what I learnt about that to the farm. \nThe same time I was working within Ranbuild, another part of our business \nat the time, I was on farm developing and learning from people, I knew \nnothing about farming in the beginning. I surrounded myself with really \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 85 \n \ngood people in earthmoving, in agronomy, in marketing…my history is \nworking in a family business, in the steel business, as well as being in the \nfarming business at the start of developing irrigation. – David Statham \nInvestigative Experiences \nInvestigative experiences may mean that initial ideas that the entrepreneurs had \nmay be found to be not viable. However, the learning that takes place while \nexploring these ideas means knowledge develops and new ideas are revealed. \nI think by hopping on a plane and going to Switzerland and saying to \nourselves we’re going to build our own spinning mill. Well that was a quick \nno, that didn’t work out. But that led us to meeting the right people, that \nled us to buying FibreTrace™…the people who we’ve met on our journey are \nsome of the best people in the world. So that stimulates our learning. Our \nlearning process is our joint ventures…. we’re getting our enthusiasm and \nour training and our learning from people we’re associating with further \ndownstream – David Statham \nBuilding Relationships and a Collaborative Knowledge Network \nThe importance of relationships is possibly the most important thing that I \nhave ever learnt. I studied fashion, and I was a milliner for 25 years. I \nalways kept my hand in fashion. I had my own wholesale distribution \nfashion agency. I had my own denim label for a short time which gave me a \nmassive insight to be able to take our business to the next level, \nunderstanding where the cotton ends up. So textiles, fashion, and the \nimportance of relationships were the most important facets of my business \nlife. – Danielle Statham \nDavid and Danielle both valued stepping outside of their agriculture ‘bubble’ and \nfinding the transferable approaches and different skillsets that could assist their \nentrepreneurial endeavours. This becomes an act of knowledge sharing and \ndevelopment for all parties involved.  \nWe’re slowly gathering people along the way with that journey. We still have \nthe original inventor of the traceability technique with us. And we’ve been \nable to commercialise that from this tiny little seed into a full-blown tree for \nhim. And in return that’s actually educated both of us. Our business partner, \nwe’ve been able to educate him on the farming, he’s been able to educate \nus on the manufacturing side at an intricate level. There are people who \nhave magnetised together, who all think the same, that have been able to \nwork (collaboratively). – Danielle Statham \nDiscussing personal development with David and Danielle is a reminder that \neducation credentials are an imperfect measure for the meaningful development \nof knowledge and skills. With the cotton industry’s recent focus on identifying \ntargets and ways to measure social sustainability of the industry, the implications \nare that accurately capturing a snapshot of skills may involve more than \neducation and training metrics. The people development aspect of social \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 86 \n \nsustainability within the cotton industry may be additionally measured by an \nindividual’s proactivity, conscientiousness, openness to experience, relationship \nbuilding skills and other factors that underpin one’s engagement in lifelong \nlearning, and their ability to adapt and to find opportunity. Developing these \nskills are what is required for individuals involved in the cotton industry to shape \nthe future, drive it forward and generate new approaches to what is the business \nof the cotton industry. \nStrategic Direction of the Business \nLike John Deere adapting and redefining themselves from a machinery company \nto a technology company, the Statham’s approach to business has been to \nflexibly adapt and grow in strategic ways that expand and refine their ability to \ninfluence their market impact and consequently often involves redefining their \nbusiness. This has involved pivoting away from their initial involvement in cattle \nand red meat towards cotton, where there were fewer immovable obstructions to \ndisrupting the supply chain.  \nEstablishing Good Earth Cotton™ redefines and expands their business from  \ncotton farming to a producer and supplier of sustainably produced, traceable \nfibre for the ethical fashion industry. Under the umbrella of Good Earth Cotton™ \nare their farming and ginning operations, and supply chain traceability solution \nbusiness, FibreTrace™. In addition to this, the Statham’s and their team have \nformed a number of informal/in-kind partnerships (collaboration with \nresearchers, machinery/technology companies to develop better precision \nagriculture tools) and formal/business partnerships (partnering with ethical \nfashion manufacturers) to realise their “seed to shelf” vision for their business. \nIt must be noted to set this vision relies on David and Danielle’s strategic \nforesight abilities. These abilities were made very clear in Danielle’s description \nof how they connected several concepts to decide on the direction in which they \nneeded to steer their business. \nWe had so much data, and we are good at collecting it… in terms of cotton, \nwe were driven by transparency and without data there’s no use talking \nabout sustainability, there’s no use talking about environmental and \neconomic sustainability if you haven’t got data to benchmark against. I \nrecognised that early in our business and I could see that from the other \nangle, the downstream supply chain, that everything was heading that way. \nI knew what David was doing and I knew that everything that was \nhappening out on the farm was directing back to that data. So, for every \nfibre to tell a story it was just imperative, we just had to do it. Because \neconomically, environmentally, and sustainably that is the future of fashion \nand the future of the cotton industry if they want to remain relevant with \nmarket value in the fashion supply chain. – Danielle Statham \nThe strategic vision for the business has come from an extension of the strengths \nthat exist within the business, and consideration of the risks/opportunities that \nexist beyond the farm gate and into the future. These, along with some strategy \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 87 \n \naligned recent changes within the business, and the impacts these hold for \nworkforce are explored more in depth in the following sections. \nHow do the entrepreneurs create the innovative work environment, \ndevelop the skills and workforce capability and the structure required to \nbe at the cutting edge of industry? \nUnderstanding the ways in which innovation happens at Sundown Pastoral \nCompany requires understanding (a) the orientation to work that the Statham’s \nand their key team members possess, (b) the work conditions that facilitate \ninnovation, (c) the prioritisation of data driven approaches to agriculture and (d) \napproaches to attracting, managing, and retaining people. \nAn Innovative Orientation to Work \nThe whole story began by being inquisitive, I was always inquisitive. From \nthe day I stepped onto that cotton farm, I loved that whole industry. I \nunderstood textiles, and I understood the purpose or use for cotton. For me, \nit was fascinating and intriguing that this whole supply chain could be \nconnected one day. I saw that there was little or no connection between the \nfashion industry and the cotton industry or the raw fibre industry. And it \nwas a big passion of mine to bring them close together. – Danielle Statham \nAn innovative orientation, as described by David and Danielle, could be defined \nas a mastery orientation, openness to experience, curiosity, humility, persistent \ndetermination, and a dissatisfaction with the status quo. These orientations and \ntraits underpin the openness that people on the farm have for new ideas and the \nactivity, processes and projects that they engage in as part of the way the farm \nand broader business is managed and developed. As David explains, when asked \nabout the motivation to engage in research and development activities on \nKeytah:  \nWe’ve always wanted to be the best. Always wanted to be understanding \nwhat is coming through, to be the best. So I’ve always engaged with people \nthat want to try things and that’s where that comes from. – David Statham \nAnd on the motivation to develop Good Earth Cotton™  \nthat’s what drove me…The merchant system around the world is over 200 \nyears old, and there’s the potential to make some slight modifications to the \nway this works that could improve the grower’s position in the supply chain. \n– David Statham \nThey described recent developments, such as expanding the operations into \nNorth Queensland as “there’s so much excitement pioneering something in that \narea”.  – Danielle Statham \n The Statham’s have sought out some key staff (particularly in leadership or \nmanagement roles) that share their orientation to work. People who also are \nprepared to work with other innovators, develop their own mastery within their \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 88 \n \nroles, bring ideas into the business, and be a part of bringing the strategic vision \nto life.  \nDefinitely the people that you employ have got to have a passion for it as \nwell and that’s certainly the case with Nick, and Nathaniel, and Wil. Our \nguys that are out on the farm, they enjoy it as well. – David Statham \nWil (agronomist) describes his involvement in the innovation system within \nSundown Pastoral: \nThere's plenty of cotton farms, but I just love that we are (Sundown \nPastoral) always trying to do something different, you know, with the fibre \ntrace, with the way they're growing it and they're not complacent on how \nthey've done it in the past. They're dynamic and evolving with the time or at \nleast try to be. A lot of people are these days. That's what I personally like \nabout it. You're part of a good company….that's why it's great working for \nsomeone like Nick, he just thinks outside the box. – Wil Jackman \nCreativity is not a word often used within on-farm professions, but within the \nagricultural context it  appears that the phenomenon is present but often \ndescribed as generating new solutions to existing problems. When interviewing \non-farm workforce participants about their career development, it was \ndiscovered that two of the three had initially pursued tertiary education in \ncreative areas seemingly unrelated to farming (Art Design and Teaching, \nBachelor of Design/Town Planning). Transferable skills from these initial \ninterests, that were abandoned for an interest in agriculture, serve these people \nwell within an innovative workplace like Keytah. \n \nI've got a combination of practical and creative….I much prefer to build \nsomething that I created than to build something someone else created.– \nNathaniel Phillis \nThe dissatisfaction with the status quo that can drive continuous improvement \nalso requires individuals to be willing to adapt and change within this dynamic \nenvironment. Wil describes: \nI think anyone that likes a job or is good at it should be adaptable anyway. \nYou should never think you know everything. If you don't approach the job, \nwilling to change and adapt in certain environments, you're probably \ndoomed to failure. \nFacilitating Conditions \nPeople who have an innovative orientation to work, also need the conditions to \nenact entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial behaviours. The abilities and skills that \nmake individuals valuable contributors to an innovative workplace need to be \nencouraged and reinforced by the environment and systems in place. Conditions \nthat facilitate innovation on Keytah include an acceptance of the learning curve \ncosts, investment in the tools required (in particular, good connectivity for digital \ninnovation), a collaborative culture where expertise is shared to the mutual \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 89 \n \nbenefit of all parties, and an emphasis on experiential and continuous learning in \nthe workplace through vicarious or direct experiences.  \nWorking for an organisation that is willing and able to accept there are costs to \nthe learning curve means workers stay open to considering possibilities and \ninvestigating new ideas that otherwise they may not explore. This level of risk-\ntolerance contributes to an innovative culture on Keytah. \nAgain, it comes back to the people that you've got around you and your \npsyche….I'm lucky that I've been involved with a farm that is happy to be \nthe first people to do it. To our own detriment at times of course, but big \nenough to cover those losses if there are losses involved in that process. – \nNathaniel Phillis \nThere’s definitely a cost …you don’t get a good result all the time, but if you \ndo get a result that improves the business or improves productivity or \nwhatever we’re aiming for, it outweighs it 10 to 1, the cost of doing the \ntrial. – Nick Gillingham \nRemoving barriers that otherwise may frustrate efforts to explore the use of \ntechnology has been important. Getting the core infrastructure in place, in this \ncase internet and telecommunications connectivity, and ensuring it is reliable has \nbeen essential to moving forward with digital agriculture approaches that are \nrequired to progress the business towards the strategic vision. \n…all the systems we’re deploying require remote monitoring. It’s no good \nhaving remote telemetry in your pump stations if you’ve got no mobile \nconnection at home. There’s no benefit whatsoever. So the most critical \nthing is on-farm infrastructure for telecommunications. Because every single \npart and piece of technology requires a mobile service or a \ntelecommunications service to make them reliable. – Nick Gillingham \nSo (collecting the amount of data) has been a bit painful and time \nconsuming but we’ve tried to streamline it so it’s not too bad. And with good \nconnectivity we can access it all on a server base system that makes it a \nlittle easier. - Nathaniel Phillis \nUnder education and training, the Statham’s had identified how collaboration was \nessential for growth. This approach does not stop at the owner/director level of \nthe business but is a culture that runs through it with others describing \ncollaborations that had shaped work on Keytah. A collaborative culture becomes \nessential as the problems that encourage innovation are challenging, complex, \nand solutions can require multidisciplinary expertise. Building these sorts of \nrelationships within the team or with those outside the farm business is essential \nto bring people along the innovation journey and to achieve results that extend \non what was previously possible. The practical knowledge that the on-farm team \nbring to the technology providers makes them a valuable part of the innovation \nsystem. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 90 \n \n…having the right people around us that are quite often reasonably \ninnovative. You're evolving as you go. When we first started looking into \nsiphonless irrigation, we looked at people that had already tried it. We \nlooked at so many variations of it. Then we went to designers and said, \n“Look this is what's out there. Can you make one of these models fit our \ncountry?” Nick and I, we'd hit dead ends all the time, because (the \ndesigners) had limited practical understanding. They were looking at it \npurely from a design standpoint. And we were going, “No, it's got to work”. \nSo in the end, we went, “We've looked at everyone's (system/design) we're \njust going to go, this is what we want.” – Nathaniel Phillis \nI started making some clunky designs and then of course, I'm meant to be \ndoing other things, not inventing stuff. So we got (the technology provider) \nto look at their structures and said, “This is what I've done. This is what we \nwant it to do. This is how we want it to function.” They took that back and \nthey had an engineering department, they had a research and development \ndepartment and they just brainstormed what we had and developed the \nproduct. That's a commercial product now, but it came out of what we \nwanted. While we like to make things specific to Keytah, we'll normally get \nsomeone on board that we know can develop a product that they can \ndevelop for the rest of the industry…. we're big enough to be able to drive \nsomething, get it moving, and then we can get someone else involved. – \nNathaniel Phillis \nThe reputation that Keytah has as someone who others can work with to develop \ninnovative ideas means that they are sought out and stay connected with others \nseeking to change the way things are done in the cotton industry – they are part \nof a bigger system of innovation. \nA lot of people come to us with new ideas. Because (a) we’ve got scale, and \n(b) we’re known as people that will try new things…once you start you end \nup attracting people. – David Statham \nA systematic process of discovery and learning through direct or vicarious \nexperience is central to knowledge development on Keytah. Experimentation, \ntrials, and trying to find ways to continuously improve is encouraged. As David \ndescribes: \nThe R&D can be done at a farm in Narrabri or Wee Waa, or it can be done in \nEmerald. But there is no better data having R&D done in front of you, \nexperiencing it, in your own valley, on your own farm. \nNick, the farm manager, has made this a part of the way decisions are made \nwhen it comes to adapting farm management strategies to achieve better \noutcomes. \nI used to do a lot of trial work before I was here so I’m used to doing heaps \nof different trials. So we really pushed it from a farm level… To get answers \non new things, is why we do it from the management level \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 91 \n \nOther staff describe their learning as directly influenced by what happens within \ntheir work environment. Nathanial describes it well when he discusses that, for \nhim, it’s not so much about staying up to date on trends but getting a good \nunderstanding of the problem on farm, checking what solutions are available and \nif they are not fit for purpose, finding a way to improve or do something new to \nimprove on the current situation on farm. \nInterviewer: How do you stay up to date on different trends in agriculture \nand what changes might be coming? \nNathaniel: Good question. So bit of word of mouth and, physically driving to \nan innovator’s to look at their system. And never closing your mind when \nyou think, developing being innovative in thinking about things. It's just \nhappening on the farm constantly, so it’s through experience (that I learn). \nIt's more driven by \"Well, we've got to be able to do this better, this is just \nmad, why are we doing it this way.\" I mean, we're lucky and I'm lucky \nenough to be working with a company that has always spent money trying \nto be better. \nWil explains: \nIt's easy (to stay up to date with new technology) at Keytah when they're \nthe ones pushing for half of it…. I'll probably have to research our own stuff \nmore than other stuff. \nData and Digital Technologies \nCollecting objective data to drive decision making on farm has long been a part \nof the way the Statham’s have done business. More data has been able to be \ncollected through the different digital technologies that have been adopted over \nthe years. Ultimately these digital technologies help to manage assets, make \nbetter decisions that improve the environmental and economic sustainability of \nthe business, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of farm management \npractices. (Table 4.1) \nThe extensive history of data that has been collected has allowed the Stathams \nto objectively demonstrate how their best practice management approaches are \nenvironmentally sustainable and carbon positive. \nThe previous steel business that I grew up in was Ranbuild. And everything \nwas data driven and data collection. That same logic applied into farming, \ndatabases, good management systems, and the guys that I employed were \nall agronomists that were highly intelligent people, very good at what they \ndid and they believed in data capture as well. So by default we’ve captured \ndata for a long period of time. I didn’t know the power of this carbon story \n20 years ago, but because we’ve captured the data, we’ve been able to \ncapitalise on it. A lot of people we’re talking to now can’t capitalise on it, \nthey have to start today because they haven’t got the data. – David \nStatham  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 92 \n \nConsultants try and keep a fair bit of data. We’re probably at the extreme \nend. The one thing it does provide you is a great history and go back and \nanalyse what you have done and what you can improve. And an example of \nwhere it has been extremely useful is for trying to work our carbon \nfootprint. Because we’ve got 15 years of data; every single paddock, every \nsingle operation, everything that has happened to that paddock captured in \na database. Which made it relatively easy for them to go back and measure \nour carbon footprint historically. Which if you didn’t have that data, you’d be \nguessing a bit about what’s gone on. – Nick Gillingham \nWhat our guys also saw was the fact that that data enables you to \nbenchmark yourself against the previous crop, where you have to go with \nyour soil. Therefore, that benchmarking data is economically sustainable. So \nit was all about economics, and how we get better yields, how to improve \nyour soil, how to actually manage what you’re doing and really take it to the \nnext level, and what technology you can bring back in to take it to the next \nlevel. By default it’s morphed into an environmental sustainability story. – \nDanielle Statham \nAt the farm level the value of digital technologies is about continually improving \nthe precision of activities that impact the crop, removing subjective judgements \nor variability in performance standards and making incremental gains that lead \nto significant improvements. \nIrrigation manager, Nathaniel describes: \nWe're trying to get all the little one percenters right. So we get our yields to \ngo up and up, and our costs go down. What we're looking for is precision \nirrigation systems, that's what we're chasing. So whatever can be precise.  \nIf you take out the human side of things, and you've got reliable technology, \nthen you can get precision. \nFurthermore, specific digital technologies that were discussed reduced labour \nrequirements in both administrative tasks and physical labour. Some \ntechnologies served to improve information sharing between different levels of \nworkforce (Microsoft Navision) and between teams working across physically \ndistant locations (Trello). Some technology allowed greater transparency of \nworkers’ actions which improved accountability (Deputy system), or facilitated \nownership of decision making in a way that balanced management control with \nstaff autonomy (accessible purchase order system with pre-set spending limits).\n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 93 \n \n \nTable 4.1.

Along the way, they have identified \ntalented individuals with the skillsets required to bring Good Earth Cotton™  to \nthe market. For example, David describes how his business development and \nspecial projects manager has come to be involved in their business. \nHe was my best customer, he then became my best employee, he then \nbecame the manager of the business when I left, and I knew one day I’d \nemploy that guy. He’s too good. And he’s now working with us on special \nprojects like FibreTrace™ …He’s very good at business, marketing, people \nskills…– David Statham \nAs Danielle described: We bring on the greatest minds to be able to forge it \nforward. I know we keep circling back to this, but relationships are key. \nWith regards to hiring their on-farm staff, the Statham’s described how for them, \nattitude is the essential base on which staff skills and capabilities can be built.  \nAttitude is number one, because I truly believe with the right attitude you \ncan teach someone anything. – David Statham \nWhen asked to describe what the target attitude looks like in an ideal employee, \nDavid and Danielle described a recent gap year student they had employed due \nto her passion and polite persistence in trying to secure work experience. \nDanielle: We had a young girl who had nothing to do with agriculture, her \nfamily had nothing to do with agriculture. She knew nothing about it but she \njust knew that was where she wanted to be…And she pestered David.. \nDavid: Nicely, in a passionate way. And she used to watch the weather \nmaps. She’d text me the BOM and it was just constant over a period of \ntime. \nDanielle: She wanted to irrigate out at the farm. And she knew that we \nalways took out a heap of young kids. It’s hot weather, they get great \nmoney and to have a good crew of young kids out there is imperative. And \nshe knew she wanted to be a part of that and that was her way to \nunderstand agriculture. And we said to her \nDavid: There’s no water… \nDanielle: There’s nothing to irrigate, there’ll be no cotton \nDavid: But she kept persisting and I’ve never had that. I’ve never seen that. \nWhen you see something like that, not once, not twice, not three \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 96 \n \ntimes…five, six, and seven times she just kept asking. I sat in my desk one \nday, I said, I’m giving this girl a job, she deserves a job. So I created a job \nfor her in the middle of the drought. That’s what I look for. \nDanielle: And now she’s at ANU and she is studying agriculture and \nbusiness.  \nThis young person’s willingness to learn from the ground up, to take on a hard \nlaborious job, to communicate in a way that sought to connect and empathise \nwith her employers with regards to lack of rain, and to keep finding ways to learn \nmore even when experiencing knock backs demonstrates a resilience and \ncommitment that is desirable in an employee. This attitude powers skill and \nknowledge development and gives a base on which a farm business can build in \norder to more easily shape a new recruit into a valuable team member.  \nWhen bringing in skilled on-farm staff, prior understanding of how data driven \ndecision making fits within a farming business is also essential, and not \nnecessarily something that graduates are coming prepared with. \nI had an ag graduate come out to Sundown Valley.. we were looking for \nsomeone and she had just finished 4 years of university. She came out and \nwe went through about four or five things we do on Sundown, in the beef \nindustry, and they had not learnt one of them. And my recommendation \nwas for her to go work in Dairy in NZ for a couple of years and then come \nback. Because those people measure everything, every day. They know \ntheir inputs, they know their outputs, they know their time management. \nEverything is down to the minute. It’s amazing, some of those good \noperations over there. That’s what I told her to do. I don’t know whether \nshe did or not, but she was a very well educated and she was the best of \nthe best and it was just scary to know how little they knew about farming. – \nDavid Statham \nThe approach of “measuring so you can manage” is a central principle to how \nwork happens within Sundown Pastoral company and the right person needs to \nhave some knowledge with regards to this. Valuing the skills people develop \nthrough experience underpins perceptions of the ‘right person’ for their business. \nIt is clear from reading the bios of the Sundown Pastoral team that once the \nStatham’s have found the right people for their business, they are effective at \nretaining them. The people-centric approach taken to form their management \nand leadership team, is also reflected in the way they value the rest of their \nworkforce.  \nPeople Management \n \nDigital systems are not a substitute for people management practices. They may \neven require a more thoughtful approach to people management to effectively \nintegrate and balance the human and digital systems on farm. As irrigation \nmanager, Nathaniel describes: \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 97 \n \nThe biggest thing I have against Trello is in the wrong hands or used \nincorrectly it can create a sterile environment where people feel like they're \nrobots and they aren't actual people. And so that's the balance I'm trying to \nstrike.  \nOther than Trello, some of the digital systems used on the farm allow greater \noversight of employees, including their start times and location.  This information \ncan provide objective evidence of performance issues if team members are not \nmeeting the work expectations on farm. Integrating this data into performance \nmanagement was done with an empathetic approach, allowing employees take \naccountability for their actions and being provided support for corrective actions, \nif required. This approach to using data to support managing the staff builds \ntrust within the team as transparency does not mean being micromanaged nor \nthat errors will automatically result in punitive action. Instead, it becomes \nunderstood that this data will be used in a way that results in a fair work \nenvironment. \n \nPeople working at Keytah have been on the forefront of change in the cotton \nindustry. As Nick describes, this change is a continuous process and effectively \nmanaging people through this requires transformational leadership (see \nKilmarnock case study for more detail about Transformation Leadership): \nChange has been happening in farming forever and a day. It’s not like it’s \nanything new. It’s just a slow pivoting, it’s always slowly changing. You’re \ntrying to bring them (staff members) along for the ride and making sure \nthey understand why we’re changing and what the benefits are. You let \nthem voice their issues around it and try and resolve those issues to get \nthem on board. Because if they’re not on board it can get quite difficult to \nhave the change run smoothly and to get it to work properly. – Nick \nGillingham \nBoth Nick and Nathaniel are responsible for leading teams and highlighted the \nimportance of understanding the individual differences of their employees to \noffer tailored support or facilitate different approaches to get everyone to accept \nand adopt the change. This is important when the change may not have direct \nbenefits or impacts on their team members work but creates an additional \ndemand for the staff to handle. The example given was Trello. For some workers, \nit suits their approach to work, they have good attention to detail and working \nwith a checklist to complete gives them a sense of accomplishment. Others see \nthe checklist as an added burden and micromanaging their work.  \nNathaniel explains: \nIt's got nothing to do with skill levels or with literacy, it’s purely personality \nbased. So those people that want to be clean and tidy are clean and tidy \nwith it, they want it done. They're organised. Those that don't like authority \nso much are more likely to buck the system and just don't want to give you \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 98 \n \nthe information. They’ve got all the skill in the world. They know exactly \nwhat they should tell you, but they don't want to be micromanaged. And \nthen my response to them is - You take the reins and I'm happy for you to \ncreate your own job list so I can see them. So that's a conversation I can \nhave. You have got to do it in a democratic way rather than a dictatorship \nway. As soon as it becomes, that “you only do it in that way” you'll exclude \npeople.  \nNathaniel as a manager has tried to adapt the task to work with the different \nstrengths of his team and to make sure they feel included in the process of \nadopting workflow organisation technology. Some like clear direction and others \nwant more autonomy in managing their workload. Nick also echoed this \nsentiment of trying to meet staff needs in encouraging them through the change. \nRegular communication, clearly set expectations, and support is required. \nSometimes this may involve tough conversations.    \nYou just get involved and talk to them constantly. Coach them through it. \nSometimes it doesn’t work smoothly, and you’ve got to make sure that you \ndon’t be their mate all the time. You’re in the leadership position. (There \ncan be issues if you’re) trying to be mates with them instead of being the \nleader they need you to be. And that depends a lot on personality types. \nYou’ve still got to have some empathy and not be a dictator either. At the \nsame time, we don’t get too much staff turnover so we’re doing a \nreasonable job. – Nick Gillingham \nContinuing to check in with staff and being an active and present manager helps \nto keep the team working towards the farm goals. Technology like Trello is a \ngood record keeping tool but it is only as good as the accuracy of the data that is \nentered, and similar to other digital systems, workforce data also needs ground \ntruthing. \nthat's where you can get caught out with technology. Just because the box \nhas been ticked doesn’t mean it’s been done. – Nathaniel Phillis \nBeing diligent and dedicated in managing people, connecting with them, ensuring \nthey have what they need to give their best at work and recognising their \ncontributions was a priority for the leadership team on farm. There was an \nawareness that when digital systems might offer short cuts to overseeing a \nteam, that this could be counterproductive to ensuring the employees were \nengaged and satisfied at work.  \n…one of the biggest things I learnt in management training was the most \nimportant thing to a person is not how much money they're making, but it's \ntheir status. So how important they feel in their role and valued in the \ncompany….as long as we don't lose that, we’ll be good. – Nathaniel Phillis \nRetention: Development opportunities and valuing diversity \nThere was a recognition of the value that existing employees bring with their \nskills. It is also their organisational knowledge that is important for efficiency and \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 99 \n \nproductivity on farm. Retaining staff members with this organisational knowledge \nwas a priority.. An example was the recruitment of Wil Jackman into the \nagronomy role. His was a less traditional career path (i.e. not a straight \nagricultural science tertiary pathway), but one where different educational \nexperiences, work experiences, and organisational knowledge of Keytah made \nhim a good candidate for Nick Gillingham to hire and train.  \nI'd never considered myself an agronomist, well because I wasn't at that \ntime, and for someone like Nick to give you an opportunity like that. I think \nthat's probably half the reason Nick even approached me… Just from being \nthere (on Keytah), I understand how they do things and why… I don't know \nif it's ever been explained to me….I didn't really have to ask… I know how \nKeytah rolls and you can kind of just fit into that….I'm just trying to be part \nof the structure and system that is already in place and help the company \ndo a good job of what we already do. – Wil Jackman \nAs well as access to development opportunities in the form of career growth \nwithin the business, staff are given access to education and training \nopportunities. These could be from formal education providers or industry-based \ntraining (at the time of the interview Wil was undertaking the UNE cotton \nproduction unit and has recently been accepted into the Future Cotton Leaders \nprogram) to short courses or on-the-job training run through vocational training \nproviders or machinery dealerships. \nI don’t have any formal strategy but definitely as courses come up we offer \nthem to staff. And sometimes they take them up, sometimes they don’t. \nWe’ve done everything from little welding courses to some leadership \ntraining. We’ve done a whole range of different courses, when they come up \nand they’re available. – Nick Gillingham \nAs people become more experienced and knowledgeable within their work, that \nexpertise was valued and the space given for those who were motivated to \nexplore these ideas within their jobs. \nI think that's why I'm still here (at Keytah) because there's been enough \nfreedom to use our own brains a little bit.  We’re a family-owned business \nthat’s big enough to have the benefits of some of the corporates but we're \nnot bound and restricted by red tape.  - Nathaniel Phillis \nWhile it is desirable for the next generation coming into the farm to be more \ndigitally literate than in the past, the importance of retaining older team \nmembers and the influence they could have on the workplace culture was \nvalued. Not every staff member needed to be intrapreneurial. Diversity within \nthe workforce was valued. \n \nDavid: I’ve got a couple of old guys where the value of what they bring, the \nexperience of the farm and the basics – turning up on time, long hours, \nloyal – you can’t replace those sorts of things. We’re just training up one or \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 100 \n \ntwo specific people in specific areas and when those technologies are \nrequired inside the tractors, we have just one guy set up to start it. You \nknow what I mean? So I’m continuing to work with the older generation \nbecause I never want to lose those old values, they’re too hard to replace. \nAnd the loyalty that those old fellows have got – that’s priceless. \nDanielle: The (younger workers) need role models. And those role models \nare those older guys on the farm. \nDavid: There is definite value in the diversity of the workforce for sure.  \nWhat strategic decisions have been made recently that have changed the \nbusiness and what does this mean for the workforce? \nTwo recent developments within the business that have workforce implications \nare the expansion of automated irrigation on Keytah and the expansion of \nproduction locations to include a property in North Queensland. Both the \nNorthern expansion and the increasing adoption of automation align with \nstrategically attempting to retain a core, highly skilled workforce within the \nSundown Pastoral company. In farming this is a consistent challenge with not \njust in-season variation in workflow requirements but also predicted increasing \nclimate variability affecting demand for workforce.  \nThe hardest thing is we don’t have a consistent workflow. It’s not consistent \nbecause it’s a lot of seasonal type work and then to make it even harder, we \nhave droughts and we shut down. Which is always going to make it \nextremely difficult to keeping any skilled permanent staff full time. \nSomehow, we’ve got to become less affected by droughts and water, and I \ndon’t really know what the answer is for that. – Nick Gillingham \nExpansion of Automated Irrigation  \nBankless channel automation could be the biggest change, I believe, in \ncotton farming. We’ve developed over 1250 hectares of bankless channel \nirrigation. We’re working with Goanna and Sierra Technologies to deploy in-\nfield sensors… it’s a fully automated irrigation system which will deliver \nhigher yields, better water use efficiency, and less labour….It eliminates \nhuman error is the first thing it does…. The utopia is to have the in-field \ntelemetry sensors trigger the water to start and then that would be fully \nautomated. – David Statham \n….the biggest stress of running a cotton farm is irrigating. All the damage \ncan be done by being too early, too late or too much water. It’s all around \nChristmas time, it’s stressful, you need all of the labour and with labour \ncomes stress. – David Statham \nThe expansion of the automated bankless irrigation system (or siphon-less \nirrigation, as Nathaniel refers to it), reflects the positive results that have been \ndemonstrated through irrigation trials over the last decade. The benefits of \nreducing reliance on an unskilled itinerant workforce for a vital task on farm is to \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 101 \n \nget greater accuracy and efficiency in watering and reduce the number of people \nworking in the business who are employed for survival reasons (employees who \nare solely motivated to seek work on farm for a pay check or visa requirements) \nas opposed to self-determination reasons (employees who are motivated to seek \nwork on farm because it aligns with their interests, abilities, and goals). \nReducing this type of seasonal labour reduces a job demand on managers who \nare responsible for ensuring job performance standards are at a level that has a \npositive impact on yields. Many of these workers will not be around to see the \nlonger-term impacts of their work on the crop and may only work one season \nmeaning they are not learning from past performance experience in the same \nway a permanent farm-hand does. Replacing these roles with automation may \nreduce stress on managers and make it possible to retain a smaller higher skilled \nworkforce through challenging seasons leading to improvements in the social \nsustainability of work on farm. \nTechnology has a big role (in the future of work at Keytah). We’ll one day \nhave automated tractors and irrigation systems that could be fully \nautonomous. Therefore keeping higher skilled permanents on farm, even \nwhen things aren’t happening (like in dryer seasons) won’t be so much of a \ndrag. You know they won’t be doing much but maybe you could afford to \npay a few higher skilled guys rather than a larger workforce doing not \nmuch. So that could be a solution. I don’t know whether it will be but we’re \ntrying to head down that road. I don’t know whether it’s going to work. – \nNick Gillingham \nWhile the rise of automation has led some to lament a loss of jobs in the \nindustry, the people interviewed on Keytah were optimistic and positive about \nthe continual progress away from partial automation to fully automate tasks on \nfarm and what this would mean for the people who work in agriculture.  \nWhen I started, the workforce in general was made up of a lot of people \nwith like-minded agricultural backgrounds. The danger of some of this \npartially automated machinery like tractors that steer themselves, you have \ntaken away the old skill levels that came from people with agricultural and \nmachinery backgrounds, you’ve replaced it with someone who could be \nanyone off the street and throw them on there….(in the past) even (entry \nlevel) workers were involved in the industry because they were passionate \nabout it. But you'll find passion is more at the manager level now and for \nthe workers 'it's just a job'. – Nathaniel Phillis \nWith regards to the rise in automation:  \nI guess you could probably take that two ways. If you're a worker you’re \nthinking, 'Well, look, technologies going to take my job. So what's the point \nof caring” but the other side of that is saying, “Well, if we really care, we \ncan be the people looking after this technology”…I feel (with more digital \nagriculture) there's a swing back to where we need people that want to be \ninvolved in farming…The way I see it, technology is not a way of replacing \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 102 \n \npeople so much as replacing the people you don't want, and then we can \nafford to pay a higher skill set. – Nathaniel Phillis \nRaising the skill level of on-farm professions will change the type of employee \nthat is required on farm. Getting more motivated people for whom farming is \ntheir ideal choice of work means getting a team that are cohesive in the \nalignment of their personal and professional goals. It also means getting people \nwho are likely to build lives where they can access fulfilling work opportunities. \nThis will have a positive effect on the connections that can be formed between \nteam members, and consequently improve the organisational culture. \nwhen you're dealing with someone with a decent skill set, you're dealing \nwith a type of person that you can relate with a lot better. Quite often \nseasonal workers are not someone you can connect to that well, that might \nbe because they're a backpacker, they're not going to be back next year. If \nyou can replace that sort of labour with people with families and good skill \nsets, and you can connect on more than one level, I think that makes it \nbetter for everyone. – Nathaniel Phillis \nNorthern Australia Expansion \nFrom a personal angle, there’s so much excitement pioneering something in \nthat area. That’s been a massive driving force…to be able to pioneer that up \nnorth and take your team into something like that is great for morale and \nit’s great for our family – Danielle Statham \nWhile operations on Keytah were scaled back during drought, Sundown Pastoral \nhad diversified the geographical locations of the farming business with the \npurchase of St Ronan’s. The timing of this expansion was essential to retain \nskilled staff during drought and was also necessary as the development of Good \nEarth Cotton™  relies on a stable supply of sustainably produced cotton. \nWe’ll be planting and harvesting at different times of the year. It will help \nour supply of cotton over a 12-month period…. There’s so much utilisation of \nthe same people, in two different parts of the country at different times of \nthe year. The utilisation of staff was probably the biggest thing. And the \nsupply of cotton through to the supply chain was the second thing. – David \nStatham \nNick Gillingham was involved in assessing the suitability of a location which \ninvolved considering both climate diversity and whether the logistics of co-\nordinating operations between the two locations was possible. \nGenerally, when the Murray Darling Basin gets a drought, everyone gets \naffected. The Northern property is totally out of that area. In theory, we’re \nthat far away it’s not affected (by Southern droughts) but it’s on the limit \nthough of being too far away. You don’t want to get to NT/WA and then \nlogistically it’s a real nightmare for moving trucks and machinery. – Nick \nGillingham \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 103 \n \nThe Statham’s had noted the new endeavours had boosted staff morale during a \ntime when working in agriculture in NSW was bleak. When the new farm was \npurchased, staff from Keytah began work on a fly in – fly out (FIFO) basis. The \nimportance of retaining skilled staff in a drought so that production can quickly \nexpand when water becomes available again was emphasised by farm manager, \nNick Gillingham.  \n…we did it FIFO because we shut Keytah down. It was either shut it down \nand do this (expand into the North) or make some staff redundant. I’ve \nbeen in that position 10 years ago (where a significant number of staff were \nmade redundant), and it was a bit of a nightmare when we geared up \nagain… We had a few disasters after that first initial rainfall back in \n2010/11…you can’t just turn the key and everything just starts up again….I \nworked really hard (this time around) to try and keep all those staff and \ndidn’t make anyone redundant during the drought. So hopefully we don’t \nhave too much of an issue when this water turns over and we’re back in full \nproduction– Nick Gillingham \nWhen Keytah comes through the drought and production begins again, the plan \nis to transition away from fly in-fly out and hire a mixture of permanent staff \nwith cotton experience and new locally based recruits who are settled in the \narea. Discussion on the cotton industry workforce in Northern Australia is \nexpanded in  Chapter Six. \nHow do the entrepreneurs view the future of the cotton industry? \nThree areas vital for the future of the cotton industry that were discussed in the \ninterviews was (a) connectivity, (b) traceability, transparency, and trust, and (c) \nthe next generation. \nConnectivity \nThe biggest thing that’s facing cotton growers is your connectivity and your \ntelecommunications because if you haven’t got that you can’t employ \ntechnology, it’s not reliable enough and you are going to end up going \naround in circles. – David Statham \nConnectivity has already been discussed in terms of being a facilitating condition \nof innovation occurring on Keytah. As the potential for digital agriculture grows, \nit is important that growers invest in adequate connectivity and \ntelecommunications to have appropriate infrastructure in place when they are \nready to adopt these technologies. The next generation of workers will be \nexpected to perform their tasks in the most effective ways, and this will depend \non reliable internet. Frustration around reliable connection could become a pain \npoint in their career.  \nInterviewer: When did you make the decision you weren’t going to wait \naround for Telstra to solve the problem and you were going to take it into \nyour own hands? \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 104 \n \nNick: It got to the point, basically, when we were going to have to move an \noffice into town to operate at any sort of capacity using service. And it \nwould have cost, well it was one of the contributing factors to losing a good \nagronomist. He was getting so frustrated with it and he couldn’t cope with it \nanymore.  \nInterviewer: Is that because that connectivity underlies the data capture \nyou need to do, to do your agronomy work properly? \nNick: Yeah, correct. \nConnectivity is not only vital for working in ways to maximise farm productivity, \nbut also essential to attract the younger generation, because it is central to their \nlifestyle.  \nthe thing is the workforce is getting younger, you need their skills, and all \nthese technologies we’re using you need a younger brain. Most people won’t \nsurvive without their mobile phones and connectivity. – David Statham \nSocial norms for the younger generation require immediate access to \ninformation, communication and relational needs fulfilment, entertainment and \ncultural touchpoints, and engagement in education and training occurring \nthrough internet-based services and smart phones. A failure to meet societies \nexpectations for adequate connectivity where they work and live will mean \nreducing the talent pool that cotton farm businesses can draw on for their \nworkforce. \nTraceability, Transparency and Trust \nThere are people that want the data, that want the real story, they want to \nconnect back to the farm and they’re prepared to pay. – David Statham \nGood Earth Cotton™  is responding to shifting consumer demands for sustainable \nand ethical fashion. Due to the complexity of the supply chain, traceability has \nnot been possible in the past. Instead initiatives like the Better Cotton Initiative \n(BCI) rely on the mass balance system. While BCI is transparent about how this \nsystem works and has updated labelling to disclose it, the consumers’ desire to \nphysically purchase garments that are guaranteed to consist of sustainably \ngrown cotton is not being met. This is not to say that BCI does not have an \nimportant place in improving global cotton production environmental \nsustainability – it does, particularly in encouraging companies who manufacture \nclothing that is at an accessible price point for many consumers to enhance their \ncommitment to sustainably produced cotton. However, the validation of product \norigin and the FibreTrace™ technology validating Good Earth Cotton™  meets a \nspecific demographic of consumers’ desire for transparency in order to trust \nenvironmental claims. \n…. I would be very wary of telling a story that says that it’s actually my \ncotton used to create a fabric if I couldn’t 100% guarantee or authenticate \nit, let alone make statements of environmental or ethical compliance. – \nDanielle Statham \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 105 \n \nWhen discussing their aspiration for Good Earth Cotton™ , Danielle touched on \nthe phenomenon of green washing, a term that refers to the process of \nmisleading consumers about how a company's products are more \nenvironmentally sound. With the FibreTrace™ technology, on-farm data capture, \nand the independent audits on their soil carbon levels, Good Earth Cotton™  can \neffectively combat green washing and build trust in cotton production on their \nfarm, and by extension, trust in best management practice in the Australian \ncotton industry.  \nExpanding their farming business to encompass a vision for an integrated supply \nchain has led to different skills needs for the Statham’s workforce. One example \nis Danielle’s skilful communication in explaining farming practices in a way that \nbridges knowledge gaps and connects with a broader consumer-based audience. \nTelling this story, supported with data, will enhance and maintain Sundown \nPastoral’s social licence.  \nThe Next Generation \nThe Statham’s have built a business that has a range of roles requiring different \nskillsets that would allow the next generation to see a number of different ways \nthey could use their talents in agriculture. The technology component of the \nbusiness sets them on a trajectory to compete with other digitally based \nindustries to attract STEM skilled people into a farming-centred agricultural \nbusiness. \nA lot of young people leave the farm to go to boarding school or to go to the \ncity, they don’t want to come back to the farm because it’s mundane and it \ncan be boring. Some farming techniques can be old school. They want to be \ninvolved in technology, they can see there is a wider world out there and it’s \nexciting. The future is exciting on another level which they understand. To \nhave technology on your farm and to have the full supply chain that we’re \ncreating actually excites the youth and they want to be a part of something \nnew. The kids who are potentially not interested in agriculture become \ninterested in agriculture. Or those kids that were from agriculture find a \nrekindled love for it because there’s more excitement back on the farm. \nThey can take new ideas and implement technology back there. – Danielle \nStatham \nThere is an interest from the next generation about where their work fits into the \nsupply chain and the broader world of work.  \nAs Danielle notes, \nwe’ve got a young agronomist that is working under Nick. He’s so excited \nabout the whole Good Earth Cotton™ , FibreTrace™ story. They’re really \nproud that the fibre they grow could be going to certain brands. The boys \nknow the brands we’re talking to and they’re blown away, they’re absolutely \nthrilled that what they’re producing on the ground could be promoted in \nstores worldwide.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 106 \n \nThis enthusiasm for this aspect of the business was confirmed by Wil as of \ninterest to his generation, with other older workers being more focused on the \nfarm and what they do rather than how this work fits into the bigger supply chain \npicture.  \nIt'd be quite rewarding for everyone to see it be successful, so I'm excited \nabout it. Some people that are on the farm maybe not. Not that they're not \nexcited, it’s probably a generational thing. I can see that that's where \neverything's going to go. People demand to know where their food comes \nfrom and where their fibre comes from. I can really see the importance in \nbeing able to tell that story at a consumer level. – Wil Jackman \nThe Statham’s were also interested in better connecting the education system to \nthe real world of innovative digital agriculture. \nI think that we need to be educating the education system. Even right back \nto primary school level. I think that our ag programs should be better \nconnected…engaging the youth in agriculture in exciting technologies. – \nDanielle Statham \nEducation, extension and connecting the next generation into the business is part \nof Sundown Pastoral’s social sustainability plan for the future. Investment in \ninfrastructure on Keytah included plans for a lecture theatre that makes it \npossible to host quality educational experiences that could impact on attraction \nof the next generation to the industry. \nThere’s a passion there to be able to bring the fashion industry, the \nagriculture industry and education industry all together, collaborating \ntogether and to be able to have that available at any given time through \nSundown Pastoral Company. To be able to use our facilities, to be able to \nhave time with our key staff members, other people in the industry, to bring \nall those thread lines together to take it forward and learn new skills. To \nhave that as part of their curriculum – where they come out every 6 \nmonths. But that has to start at high school level, in their ag programs, for \nthe kids to be interested and to understand that there are different \ntechniques out there to what Mum & Dad or what Gran & Grandad used. – \nDanielle Statham \nAnother way that Keytah was contributing to getting a work-ready next \ngeneration and trying to attract the next generation into the cotton industry was \nby participating in the Cotton Australia Gap Year program. General Manager, Nick \nGillingham noted this was a worthwhile investment for them and an effective \nstrategy to get young people switched onto the cotton industry, thinking \npractically prior to their university experience. \nWe have found that the cotton gap year program that’s been available is \nvery good. It would be good to keep that running because I think a lot of \nthose people that do that gap year do tend to float back into the cotton \nindustry once they finish uni because they have a bit of a background in it \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 107 \n \nbefore they went to uni. You know, we’ve picked one guy up who was from \nCanberra, never really seen a farm before and he was interested in cotton. \nNow he’s working back on cotton farms. Hopefully he’ll come back here at \nsome point too in his holidays. I think getting some people who aren’t from \nag into ag is good. – Nick Gillingham \nIt was discussed that issues with the relevance of agricultural education \nextended beyond high school to the university system. Encouraging work \nintegrated learning experiences within agriculture businesses that are data-\ndriven is essential to give university students the skills and abilities to be ready \nto embrace a digital agriculture approach to farming. The lack of practical \nknowledge of how these systems work and how to work within these systems \nimpacts on the employability of otherwise well-educated graduates. \nOur education system is nowhere near up to speed in either the universities \nor the high schools in regard to actually what happens on the farms today. \nIt’s too far behind. And that’s a challenge. – Danielle Statham \nWhen I left there was definitely a huge gap there. If its science and business \nand they can get the basic understanding, then they’ll pick it up pretty quick \non the job, the practicality of it all. There’s always been a little bit of a \ndisconnect in Australia, the actual farms to the universities. I think in the \nUSA they do a better job of connecting the universities to the farm. They do \na lot more of the trial work through their university whereas we sort of have \nthe trial work done in a separate department in the university, but they \nhave been getting a bit better lately at working with industry. – Nick \nGillingham \nLinking the farm with the education system will provide meaningful experiences \nthat can inspire the next generation to aspire to a career in the cotton industry. \nIt will also improve understanding of current practices and standards on cotton \nfarms and demonstrate the sustainability of the industry to future consumers \nwhich can be expected to have a positive impact on social licence. \nSummary and Conclusion \nThis case study has examined the personal and work environment factors that \nintersect to create an innovative business built around cotton production. The \nworkforce impacts of recent changes, including automated irrigation and \nexpansion of cotton production to the North of Australia, have been discussed. \nThe main findings include: \n• A collaborative network that draws on diverse experiences strengthens \nendeavours to innovate in the industry. \n• Mastery orientation, openness to experience, curiosity, humility, persistent \ndetermination, and a dissatisfaction with the status quo are associated \nwith entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship on farm. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 108 \n \n• Acceptance of the learning curve costs, investing in the infrastructure \nrequired for digital agriculture, and encouraging collaborative partnerships \nfacilitates intrapreneurial behaviour on farm. \n• Data is valued for improved decision making, asset and resource \nmanagement, and to improve transparency by validating best practice \nmanagement on farm.  \n• Implementing digital systems on farm and increased transparency with \nworkforce requires skilled people management and transformational \nleadership. \n• Automation is viewed as positively influencing work conditions and \nworkplace culture, and increasing the skillset required of the workforce. \n• Data and effective communication help to build trust and maintain social \nlicence \n• Technology and digital agriculture have the potential to inspire the next \ngeneration to seek out a dynamic career in the cotton industry. \nThe positive impacts that digital technology can have on workplace attraction, \nretention, and culture, and the management practices required to manage any \npotential negative impacts from the use of these technologies in current roles, \nshow an optimistic way forward for increasing adoption and the benefits that this \ncan bring to the industry. Furthermore, ensuring the digital revolution in the \ncotton industry is visible and connected to the learning experiences of the next \ngeneration is vital to compete with other industries that aim to attract the STEM \ntalent pool.   \nAt the centre of the digital agriculture future for the cotton industry is the \ncollection, management, and use of data. Cotton businesses that have not \nalready begun collecting the data required to validate their sustainable practices \nneed to consider the future impacts on their business. To postpone this, leaves \nbusinesses unable to objectively demonstrate their environmental credentials. \nThe ethical and sustainable production of commodities and the origin stories of \nthe goods they become is increasingly important to consumers at a time when \nthe cotton industry faces challenges to its social licence. Transparency and \ntraceability to build trust cannot happen without data to validate sustainability \nclaims.  \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 109 \n \nChapter Five: Summit Ag Agronomists: \nDiversity and Connection to Build a Stronger \nFuture \nIntroduction \nSummit Ag Agronomists was founded by two agronomists, Emma Ayliffe and \nHeath McWhirter, who have extensive experience in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry. Over the course of the case study interview, two themes came through \nin terms of how these people are actively shaping the future for themselves, \ntheir business and the industry. The first, diversity, was discussed in terms of the \ndiverse skill sets of an agronomist, the diverse revenue streams that could be \ndeveloped from these skills, and a desire to expand into a diverse network of \nsupported independent agronomists across diverse geographical locations. The \nsecond, connection, was discussed in terms of the ways agronomists act as a \nvaluable connector between various players in agriculture, connecting growers to \nnew ideas and innovation, a new business venture, Yacker, that sought to \nconnect people’s knowledge networks, and identifying the opportunity to become \nmore active connecting university graduates to relevant learning experiences to \ndevelop the next generation of agronomists. Industry improvement and a \nsustainable, ever-evolving career comes through these two themes. \nIn addition to these two overarching themes, insight was offered into two main \nresearch questions: \n• What is the changing role of an agronomist, including opportunities and \nthreats shaping the future of industry?  \n• What factors are associated with technology adoption by agronomists  and \ntheir clients, and the innovative behaviours of growers? \nIn prior literature, the potential for AI analytics to disrupt and remove the need \nfor an agronomist was proposed. In discussing this, these participants felt that \nwhile tasks may be facilitated by technology there is still a need for skilled \nhuman-centred approaches to advise on how industry farms now and influence \nchange as to how industry farms into the future. \nWhat is the changing role of an agronomist, including opportunities and \nthreats shaping the future of industry? \nAn agronomist can be a multi-faceted role, as described by Emma Ayliffe: \nAs an agronomist, you play a role as a business manager, as a counselor, as \na marketing manager, as a conduit between researchers, networks, \nsuppliers. You play a role in managing things like chemical demand with \nresellers. Yes, we're an agronomist, and we put that hat on and we go and \nbash around a paddock and count the bugs and work out when you should \nirrigate.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 110 \n \nBut we play so many roles in the wider industry. You know, we're the \nconduit between the researchers and the growers in the local community. \nWe get called in when things go pear-shaped, and the EPA get pulled in. \nWe're the ones that have to go and stand as the conduit between the \ngrower and the government. We quite often will put our hand up to take \nthose positions in community roles to be the voice for our producers \nbecause producers don't want to.  \nSo I think that while people look at agronomy and they think of “Yeah, a \nsweep net and a muddy paddock”. I think the realities of the job are so \nmuch more. And I think people underestimate the amount of different skill \nsets that we need to have to be bloody good at what we do.  \nTo understand more about the development of an agronomist, the education and \ntraining that Emma and Heath engage in is discussed. Factors that are \ninfluencing the changing the role of agronomist identified within each aspect of \nthe Summit Ag business are examined. These business activities  include: (a) \nconsulting, (b) farm management services, (c) research and development, and \n(d) an ag-tech startup.   \nEducation and Training \nThe agronomist profession is one of continual learning due to the changing \nconditions (weather, insects, and diseases) from year to year. Emma and Heath \nhad developed their current skillsets through a mixture of:  \n(a) University education, (undergraduate degrees in science (agronomy major), \npost graduate degrees in agriculture and agriculture economics, UNE cotton \nproduction course,  \n(b) Industry-led development programs (corporate farm cadetship, Future Cotton \nLeaders program, Picture You in Agriculture’s Young Farming Champions \nprogram),  \n(c) Vocational training courses (precision agriculture, fertiliser, corporate \ngovernance, communication and building relationships with clients, IPM), and \n(d) Experiential learning in the workplace and community (past on-the-job \nexperiences such as working as an on-farm agronomist, conducting research \ntrials, members of executive committees for agricultural organisations). \nWith regards to their skills to work in the cotton industry, they particularly noted \nthe value of the UNE Cotton Production Course. \nI think that cotton production course at UNE is the backbone of what most \npeople in the cotton industry do or should do, particularly consultants and \nadvisors or people in agribusiness. I think it's a really good grounding – \nHeath McWhirter \nA combination of short courses and on-the-job training was important for new \nentrants to industry. Revisiting short courses, such as integrated pest \nmanagement (IPM), as a more experienced agronomist was also useful for \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 111 \n \nrefreshing individual’s knowledge of best practice and refocusing their attention \non different elements of their job. It was noted there was a gap between courses \ntargeting entry level foundational skills development, and those covering the \nhigher-level knowledge that comes from current research. Emma and Heath \nnoted a potential training gap that could be addressed with the introduction of \nmid-level courses to scaffold a clearer learning journey for those in the workforce \nto develop their careers. \nBoth agronomists have a growth mindset with regards to diversifying their \nbusiness and a thorough understanding of the transferability of their skills. These \ncareer self-management skills  allows them to be actively engaged in identifying \nopportunities for work linked to current industry challenges, and developing \nvalue-add areas for industry that build off their existing knowledge and skillsets. \nA future-focused orientation also means they are seeking to strategically upskill \nthemselves in order to effectively craft their careers in response to industry \nneeds and ensure their grower clients are adapting with the times. \nBuilding a Multi-revenue Business \n \nWhen we started, we understood that had to be a fundamental thing of our \nbusiness that we only wanted a smaller proportion of our revenue directly \nassociated to that consulting. - Heath McWhirter \n \nWhile the core of the Summit Ag business is consulting, they also have \ndiversified income streams through farm management, research and \ndevelopment, and entrepreneurial activity (an ag-tech start-up). This is done to \nbalance risk when factors impact production and consequent demand for \nconsulting services reduces. For example, in the second/third year of operation, \nwhile water allocation meant cotton agronomy consulting slowed, expanding \ntheir expertise in other crops/horticulture commodities and successful tender for \nresearch projects relevant for one of their production valleys meant this part of \nthe business expanded. Through quieter years, the business partners developed \nan ag-tech start-up that aims to improve communication efficiency and \nknowledge sharing amongst people within the industry. The idea for this business \nwas formed when the agronomists identified that their clients and the wider \ncommunity could benefit from obtaining information from a range of direct \nsources with different experiences. Each element of the business compliments \nthe others and works to ensure an economically sustainable business. The \nvariety of tasks involved in the different aspects of the business create \nopportunity for further on-the-job skills development. \nConsulting \nFactors influencing the changing direction of the role of a consulting agronomist \ninclude: (a) location specific trends, (b) farm business structures, and (c) the use \nof data and technology. Additionally, potential risk factors to the ongoing \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 112 \n \nsustainability of  a consulting agronomist’s work and strategies used to manage \nthese risk factors were identified.  \nLocation Specific Factors \nDifferent threats and opportunities for industry influence the direction needed to \nbe taken with regards to continuous learning for agronomists. For example, in \nthe production valleys where Summit Ag currently operates, the almond industry \nis expanding, and as a permanent planting, it is a possibility this commodity will \ndominate water allocations and negatively impact row crop irrigators, including \ncotton growers. \nSo for us as a business, it means that we need to be working with our \ngrowers in an innovative way to set their business up to either capitalize on \nthe boom in the boom-bust cycle, or diversify to allow consistency of \nincome. But then also us as individuals, we recognize that we have to get \ninto the almond game. – Emma Ayliffe \nFarm Business Structures \nFarms and their workforce structures are changing which in turn changes \nexpectations for the role of the agronomist. There is a trend for family farms to \nexpand and take on a more corporate style management system. This means the \ngrowers are increasingly busy managing the on-farm logistics, the workers, and \nthe business operations and may not have the real time in-field knowledge they \nhave had in the past. These farms look to bring consultants into the business, to \noutsource the identification of problems in the crop, develop feasible solutions \nand make the agronomic decisions for crop management. In such arrangements, \nthe knowledge of the farm in terms of natural resources like soils is more often \nbeing established and studied by the agronomist and then transferred back to \nthe grower in the form of the rationale for the agronomist’s decisions. Whereas in \nthe past, growers held this knowledge and used it to describe problems to \nagronomists for additional solutions to be generated for their crop management. \nThis second approach is still favored by some established growers in smaller \noperations where they still have the time to be the ‘boots on the ground’ in their \ndaily activities. This subtle shift in expectations, relies on a highly skilled \nagronomist who has established a good, trusting relationship with the grower. \n \nOnce upon a time, a lot of the family operators knew everything that was \ngoing on in their paddock and they'd ring you to go and look (at a specific \nspot). They know their farm back to front, inside out and you're very much \nguided by them. (Now) with the larger scale family operations, they're \nbusy… They want you to come in, drive around, find the problems and tell \nthem what to do to fix it. You'll become part of that management team and \nthere's a lot of freedom and poetic license that you're given by those \ngrowers to make the decision and nine times out of ten they’re happy to run \nwith it. – Emma Ayliffe \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 113 \n \nTechnology used in consulting \nThe agronomist role is one that is being augmented by technology. New tools are \naiding the efficiency and effectiveness of the tasks an agronomist performs but \nthey are not replacing their consulting job. The central tasks of a consulting \nagronomist continue to require evaluating the evidence, drawing on knowledge \nand weighing up complementary and competing aspects of a system involving \nenvironment, economic, and social factors to make the best possible \nrecommendation at that point in time. There is sufficient complexity in the \nsystems and diversity in environments that ‘ground truthing’ of data by the \nagronomist is important. Adding to this, there is a human element when it comes \nto the execution of recommendations that the tech does not factor in, but an \nagronomist can. People do not always behave as they say they will or in logical, \nrational ways. \nTech doesn't take into account personality types. We've got growers that \nwe'll say (to them) irrigate on Thursday because we know they won't (be \nable to get organised) until Friday or Saturday. Some you've got to say to \nirrigate on Saturday because you know they’re going to say \"I'll just start a \nday early, just so we get around on time\".... none of this stuff takes into \naccount the human factor. – Emma Ayliffe \nReflecting on the most significant technology changes that have influenced their \njob performance, the introduction of the iPad and access to NDVI maps were \nflagged as particularly useful. The introduction of the iPad allowed for digital \nreport writing, in-field data entry (including photos and notes), and access to \ninformation systems available in app format. NDVI maps are used to plan the \nstructure of the agronomist’s farm visits, with areas identified for inspection prior \nto arriving on farm. They give an objective bird’s eye view, as opposed to trying \nto only spot problem areas with the naked eye. Both these tools allow daily \nactivities to be more time efficient and for the agronomist to more effectively \nattend to the crop whether it is recording or accessing information to aid their \nmanagement strategy. \nFarm Management \nThe farm management aspect of the business came about with an opportunity to \nhelp some owners redevelop a property to sell. Since then, Summit Ag have \ntaken on farm management of another property and this activity reduces their \neconomic reliance on the number of cotton hectares planted by their clients. \nStrategically, this work activity has allowed them to diversify the on-the-job \ntraining experiences they can utilise for a university graduate that has been \nworking with the business throughout his studies. This secondary outcome from \nthe farm management business stream addresses some of the skills gap that is \nobserved for the next generation undergoing the transition from university to \nwork. \nwe've put him on a farm for a season of driving tractors and irrigating and \nunderstanding the production side, which is what Heath and I both did, \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 114 \n \nwhich gives us an incredible foundation to be able to relate to growers and \nunderstand the production side of the business too. – Emma Ayliffe \n \nResearch and Development \nAgronomists can play an important role in connecting the research that may \nhappen in controlled environments to the multiple real-world contexts (different \nfarm systems, different production valleys) where it is intended to be used. A \nconnection to research as part of the business also brings benefits in terms of the \ndevelopment of knowledge and skills, as well as being active in influencing the \nfuture direction of agriculture. As relationships are established, this influence can \nbe enacted in two directions to improve innovation in the cotton industry. In one \nway, Summit Ag are connecting researchers and entrepreneurs to real world \nproblems, and allowing them to obtain important feedback about the impacts \n(intended and unintended) of their products. In the other direction, they are \nmore confidently able to bring new technology and agronomic solutions to \ngrowers. As Emma explains: \nI think that's where the research really fits in well. Because we're getting \naccess to a lot of products and technology and stuff like that before it's \ncommercially available and linking us in with the next step before it is the \nnext step, if that makes sense. So it allows us to be up-skilled and have a \nreally good handle on what's coming through. It also allows us to build good \nrelationships with the people that are going to develop the tech and the \nchemistry to throw problems at them to help us solve… (we can) test some \nof these (products) in our environment and offer feedback around what they \nexpect it to do, but also around some things that maybe they weren't \nexpecting it to do, and some added benefits or concerns that we have. \nA lot of the time, (technology is) being developed by amazing researchers at \nuniversity that don't understand fully the production side and the impact of \nwhat they're trying to do on the production and maybe where there's \nincompatibilities. So we can, you know, help be at that coalface and identify, \nlike, \"that's a really great concept, but it's not going to work because of x, \ny, and z,\" then we're not seeing these techs being released and growers \nlooking at it going, \"Oh, that's shit and we can't use it\" kind of thing. And \nit's going to enable that rollout to kind of happen with less of a lag.,  \nAg-tech Startup \n(We’ve got) our aspirational (revenue stream) when we get Yacker to be \nfully commercial, because then that's not related to agricultural water or \ncommodity price. And that's our vision of that project that we've been \nbrainstorming for two years and now making it reality in our drought year. - \nHeath McWhirter  \nThe wide range of expertise agronomists develop in their jobs, and exposure to \nthe different farms, and people who are involved in agriculture means they are \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 115 \n \nuniquely placed to clearly identify and develop practical solutions to problems in \nall aspects of the farming system. In this case they have created a social \ncommunication platform solution to develop people capability, collaboration, and \ncommunity trust. Yacker recognises the power of diverse networks to improve \npeople’s access to information, exploration of agricultural challenges, and to \nprovide relational supports, both professional and personal. These connections \nbetween people are facilitated in a secure platform that allows users to arrange \nconversations via phone at convenient down times, such as when driving in the \ncar. \nOne of the impacts of Yacker, if widely adopted by industry, could be \naccelerating technology acceptance and adoption. This platform gives a central \nspace for curious growers to ask questions and find experts or more experienced \npeers to assist in their journey towards adoption of digital agriculture technology. \nResearchers or ag-tech companies could get feedback on ideas and students \ncould learn more about the real world of agriculture by connecting with available \ngrowers. \nBuilding a Sustainable Career \nA sustainable career does not only mean earning sufficient revenue in your \nbusiness or income in your job. Work can mean long hours and requires effective \ntime management and relationship management to set clear expectations with \nclients around availability and acceptable response times. Being responsive is \nparticularly important for farms where the agronomist has been given greater \nresponsibility for the overall strategy and the farm manager may not have full \nawareness of the impacts of taking certain actions with the crops. Agronomists \nneed to be easily accessible for these types of operations. When your job \nproductivity is about working with people, weather, and natural resources \ntowards outcomes (getting a good crop) and not hours or outputs (number of \nhours, number of reports completed), it can be challenging to ensure this is a \nsustainable workload and for an individual to have sufficient personal and \nrecovery time. \nBeing highly organized and having good time management skills is one way for \nSummit Ag to sustain the level of work they do. Use of tools such as \nMonday.com help track all the moving parts of the business and the team \nactivities to ensure efficiency, for example, getting a team member who has \nconsulting work in a particular area on a specific day to also perform an activity \non an R&D trial site in the same area. Likewise, use of other tools, like Zoom for \nremote team meetings, a WhatsApp group chat for team problem solving (i.e. \nwhat is this weed?), and Google photos to capture images and store in a \ncentralized bank for report writing, are used to effectively collaborate and \nsupport each other’s work.  \nSuccessful agronomists who stay in the profession develop a good understanding \nof their skills, managing risk and uncertainty and what is within their control. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 116 \n \nwhen you first come out of uni, you think, you are expected to know \neverything and get everything right all the time. But in reality, it's so much \nmore bearable, it's about trying to manage people's risks and what their \nattitude to their outcome needs to be - Heath McWhirter \nWhen you leave uni, you feel completely inadequate, you're thrown into the \ndeep end and realise how little uni actually teaches you about the job that \nyou're walking in to. And you feel fine to not know much. But you get to \nthat kind of year three to five, and you think that everyone else knows \neverything, and there's a lot of pressure on yourself to not be wrong and \nmake the right decision. Then you kind of get this lightbulb moment about \nyear five or six, like Heath said, where you just go, no one actually really \nknows anything except, you know, the basics. All that we know is the \nexperiences that we've had. And what we've seen in the past of working and \nnot working and, and it's about knowing who to ring, and it's about getting \nto a point where you're comfortable with yourself to acknowledge that you \ndon't actually know and you need to ring someone or talk to someone else \nand bounce ideas and come up with that 50/50 shot. And I think that's a \ncase of getting comfortable enough in your own skin and in your own role \nand with your clients to be able to do that and not feel the pressure to be \nright. Because you're not going to be, whether you like it or not – Emma \nAyliffe \nThe Summit Ag partners had a very clear vision that focused on the value that \nteam members had in their business, and the importance of a good work culture \nto support team members. As the business grows, they are considering how to \nsustainably attract and develop the workforce they require. Ensuring the \nuniversity graduate employed by their business had good supported and diverse \nwork experiences to develop his/her skills was one way of ensuring a new \nentrant became a confident and capable team member. Identifying that other \nagronomists currently working in other businesses or resellers may want the \nopportunity to be their own boss but not have the skills or interest to handle the \nbusiness side that is required, Summit Ag have identified a potential opportunity \nto grow by expanding their network of independent agronomists and being the \nbusiness ‘backbone’ for other consultants. There is a clear economic proposition, \nbut it also adds to the sustainability of their own and other careers, as a capable, \ndiverse, connected network that adds to the collective knowledge and \nexperiences that can be drawn on. It also would allow an expansion of their \nresearch and development endeavours as they seek to support other \nagronomists in different geographical locations who could conduct trials. \nWhat factors are associated with technology adoption by agronomists  \nand their clients, and the innovative behaviours of growers? \nDiscussions about technology adopting for both agronomists and their clients, \nand innovation behaviours focused on several factors. As previously discussed in \nChapter Three, perceived usefulness and ease of use were influential on adopting \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 117 \n \nnew technology and practices within the industry. Differing social norms \nassociated with an openness to innovation had been observed for different \ndemographics of clients. Furthermore, the presence or absence of economic \nconstraints could incentivize exploration of new technologies or new revenue \nstreams. At a broader level, the ability to adopt new technology depends on \naccess to innovative scientific developments associated with cotton and this \ncould depend on the general publics’ acceptance of these. The agronomists also \nnoted that the strategic direction of farming businesses towards adoption of \ntechnology meant requiring access to higher skilled employees that were in \ndemands across the industry. \nFarm Data Management: Perceived usefulness and ease of use \nPart of the promise of Agriculture 4.0 is the ability to reduce subjectivity and \nhuman error in farm management by moving decision making away from \nintuitive judgement calls to more quantitative data-driven recommendations. \nHowever, while it is useful to have access to information to give greater \nconfidence in decision making, the value proposition for improved profits that \ncome from real time data-driven decisions is currently not realised. The \nperceived usefulness of data is further impacted by the imbalance of time and \nlabour costs associated with effective data capture, entry and management \ncompared to the time and labour costs of an experienced and knowledgeable \nagronomist inspecting the paddock. As Heath explains: \nThe reality is you can't make all the decisions from the data because it's.... \nnormally when you make a decision to irrigate a field or put a growth \nregulator on or spray insecticide, it's more than just data points. There's a \nlot of other considerations it's hard to capture on a platform. \nYou’ve got to think all these algorithms and models have all come from \npeople. And those people don't necessarily derive that information from \nGriffith it might have come out of Dubbo or Victoria or different soil types \nand different climates, so it doesn't exactly fit. For example, moisture \nprobes on irrigation, the probe might be suggesting that we need to irrigate. \nBut we can go and look at the crop. Look at the weather for the next seven \ndays. And we might decide not to irrigate. There could be 40 mils of rain in \ntwo days’ time. The probes say irrigate. And if we only looked at that piece \nof information we'd irrigate a crop and water log it. \nWhen discussing the usefulness of data, the agronomists agreed it was important \nfor tracking of issues, recording of activities, observations and progress, and \nthen reviewing to identify potential cause and effect of decisions and events in \nthe season. In this way, working with data over time improves the agronomists’ \nknowledge and skills to make effective judgement calls in the future. \nA majority of growers will have a farm data management platform designed to \nbe used within their farming business but it was observed that few have \nintegrated this activity (data management) into their daily operations or \norganised a dedicated resource to utilise such a platform to the full extent. For \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 118 \n \nan agronomist to take on this activity and capture all the data for clients would \nmean charging a fee and potentially adding a dedicated role in their business to \nprovide this service. The conundrum is the value of data cannot be realised or \nproven without ready access to sufficient and reliable data, and without a proven \nvalue proposition for data that is tied to profit, the incentive to engage in data \ncapture, entry and management activities remains limited. Clear communication \nof the economic impact of problems that data can solve is needed for buy in. \nFurthermore, the ease of use of farm data management systems is a key \nconsideration for effective adoption. This could be overcome with better user \nexperience, design of products particularly trying to efficiently capture and store \ndata in centralised platforms in more automated/less manual ways, and skills \ndevelopment for people to integrate a data management strategy into their farm \nbusiness. An easier user experience was identified as important by the \nagronomists who lost efficiency submitting recommendations across multiple \nplatforms for different grower clients.  \nMy biggest frustration is when you have multiple growers that do the same \nthing with about 15 different platforms… I have to understand how to utilise \nso many different platforms for individual growers to achieve the same \noutcome… that's where the pain point comes in, is getting guys on the same \npage and consistency. – Emma Ayliffe  \nWorking With Growers to Facilitate Change: Social norms and maintenance \npatterns. \nIntroducing innovation is a two-way street. While it more often flows from the \nagronomist to the grower, it can move in the other direction if the agronomist is \nworking with a grower who is curious and wanting to try new approaches. Either \nway, the agronomist frequently acts as a conduit between ag-tech companies \nand their clients, cotton growers.  \nWhen it comes to exploration and acceptance of new technology or approaches \nto farm management, perceived differences in social norms were observed when \ncomparing growers with different farming systems or producing different \ncommodities. Generally irrigators were seen to be quite open to considering new \nideas and tools. Along with these social norms, the experience of economic \nconstraints, (as in those that are operating within tighter margins) may impact \ninnovation behaviours, e.g. irrigation farmers who have been priced out of the \nwater market are motivated to explore other commodities and ways to value add \nto their business through direct-to-consumer products. Whereas a grower that is \nrunning a business that owns the water and has a comfortable profit margin is \ncontent to continue with their current systems. An agronomist working across \ndifferent farming systems and commodities may be able to overcome these \nobjections to innovate that stem from social norms or growers being in a \nmaintenance pattern to cross-pollinate ideas, once proven, with early-adopter \nclients. Trialling technology with one interested grower is an effective way to test \nand evaluate new products.   \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 119 \n \nWe spoke to an organization this morning and they've got a new system for \norganizing yield data. And I know from past experience where I've looked at \nand gone, “Oh, this is awesome, I'll try and implement it for all my \ngrowers”, and it just consumes all your time. So normally, if there's \nsomething new, we'll identify a grower where that would interest them and \nput it into their operation and then evaluate it over a season. If that's better \nthan what we're currently doing - off we go… it's a time efficient approach \nbecause to just go and set up a new platform for data management, you \nneed to put every field's shape file in, all the paddock history, soil tests. If I \nwould have gone set up something it'd take me literally a week to get it to \nwhere it needs to be. Yeah, immense, the amount of time that has to go \ninto these platforms. – Heath McWhirter \nSocial Acceptance of Science and Technologies \nOne of the potential game changers for the cotton industry was identified as the \nnew genetics coming into cotton that are expected to further reduce reliance on \npesticides, improve crop tolerance, and improve yields. Ensuring these \nimprovements can be realised, means ensuring consumers are accepting of GM \ntechnology and support their use. Good science communicators need to build this \ntrust beforehand to avoid any potential misinformation that could threaten \naccess to these technologies. \nDemands for a Skilled and Engaged Workforce \nAs farm businesses expand, rather than expanding the workforce, their \nemployees are required to manage larger areas of land and consequently the \nindustry requires a smaller, more highly skilled workforce. Automated irrigation \nand robotic precision sprayers (e.g. swarm farms weed-it collaboration) are \nadding to this trend. To improve agronomic outcomes, workers also need to be \nhighly engaged and motivated to put the effort in to do the job correctly, e.g. \nfollow instructions from the agronomist/farm manager.  \nThe job opportunities for students studying agriculture–related degrees at \nuniversity are often cited as upwards of five jobs for every graduate (Pratley, \n2017). When asked whether they saw this demand continuing, the Summit Ag \nagronomists agreed, with the caveat that these graduates needed to combine \ngood work experience with their academic subjects. \nIf I went to nearly all of the bigger farms where there's multiple employees \nand said here's an ag science graduate with experience in irrigation or farm \nbusiness, they'd take them tomorrow. I know on two farms at the moment, \nthey're looking for new farm managers, guys that can manage their farm \nand they want more than just someone that can run the machinery. They \nwant someone that can do the business side for them, give them the \nspreadsheet on the best return per mega litre (of water) on crops and \nidentify where the custom machinery is … and do all that end of it for the \nowners, which is a big change, I think from what the historical role have \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 120 \n \nbeen. You need to be a uni graduate to be able to do all that, nearly, like \nthey're all the things that you learn at Uni. – Heath McWhirter \nThere are a wide range of jobs where university agriculture students could apply \ntheir problem-solving, business, and farm systems knowledge and skills and add \nvalue to different organisations. \nWe're definitely seeing a shift to people running their operations, not as \nfarms but as businesses. And people are starting to understand that they're \nsitting on, you know, multi-million dollar businesses that need to be \nmanaged by skilled people, 100%. And I think that demand for the ag \nscience grads goes well beyond agronomy and farm managers, you know, \nthere's people within reseller businesses, you know, like irrigation \nbusinesses, stuff like that, that are demanding people with a good general \nbackground in science and in production that can have, you know, good \nconversations around the wider production system and think about things \nanalytically and from a business sense and not just go in and plug parts \ntogether or, you know, do that basic work. – Emma Ayliffe \nIt is important for graduates to be aware that university studies are only the \nbeginning of their learning journey, and that they be prepared to work on \ndeveloping their skills to proactively build a rewarding career in the cotton \nindustry. \nSummary and Conclusion \nThis case study has more closely examined the changing roles of agronomists \nand their observations of change relating to farm businesses within the cotton \nindustry. The main findings include: \n• Agronomists are skilled connectors and can play vital roles translating \nknowledge between different stakeholders within the cotton industry. \n• Continual development and training is essential to developing knowledge \nrequired to manage and respond to changes in the farming systems. There \nis a gap in mid-level courses that connect entry level with later career \nagronomists. \n• Career self-management skills may be needed for ag science graduates to \ncraft their roles within the industry/diversifying beyond consulting or farm \nmanagement. \n• Skills associated with managing workload are necessary to ensure a \nsustainable career. \n• Human behaviour means an agronomist will not be replaced, but rather \ntheir tasks will be augmented through the use of new technologies. \n• The relative advantage for more extensive data capture, management and \nuse is negatively impacted by ease-of-use issues and an unclear value \nproposition. \n• Farm businesses are changing in such a way that the demand for \nagricultural science graduates will continue into the future. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 121 \n \nThe skills and knowledge that agronomists develop in their careers can be \napplied to several different work roles in the cotton industry, including, but not \nlimited to consulting, farm management, product development, research, \nextension, science communication and advocacy for the industry. This means an \nagricultural science degree has a wide range of applications within the industry \nand people with different occupational interests could build a range of rewarding \ncareers from the base level knowledge obtained in this tertiary level qualification. \nSome of the job opportunities, in particular consulting, that are widely promoted \nto graduates remains vulnerable to seasonal pressures such as drought and this \nnext generation will need to develop their ability to adapt and transition at times \nof reduced work availability. To effectively navigate these risks and identify \ndifferent career opportunities, these graduates need to have strong career self-\nmanagement skills.  \nWith regards to the future of work, agronomists are vital connectors of the many \ndifferent players within the industry and central to the agriculture innovation \necosystem. To be effective contributors when positioned as connectors, \nagronomists need to be continuous learners, skilled communicators and \ntranslators of knowledge related to the diverse expertise of the different \nstakeholders with whom they interact (e.g. growers, researchers, government, \nthe community). While technology is changing the way agronomists may perform \ntheir roles, the human experience and the complex systems that need to be \nconsidered when encouraging grower practice change and adoption means their \nroles are unlikely to be completely replaced by any digital disruption.   \n \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 122 \n \nChapter Six: Workforce Considerations for \nthe Cotton Industry in Northern Australia \nIntroduction \nInvestigations into cotton production in the North of Australia encompasses the \nareas in Western Australia, and Queensland that are north of the Tropic of \nCapricorn and north of Larrimah in the Top End of the Northern Territory (CRC \nfor Developing Northern Australia). A range of crops including cotton are being \ngrown to various scales across the different states. Studying the workforce issues \nfaced by a developing cotton industry in the North is challenging as this vast area \nis diverse in biophysical properties, infrastructure, and culturally.  \nThe CRCNA (2020) has identified a lack of human capacity as a significant \nconstraint impacting development of cropping in the different areas of Northern \nAustralia. This is evident at each level of workforce. Different factors may be \napplicable in different areas of the North depending on the maturity of the \ndevelopment of cropping production in the region. A breakdown of issues for \neach sector of the workforce include: \n• Owner/grower level: need to build cropping knowledge and capacity in \npastoral focused operations, \n• Agronomist/Consultant/Farm manager level: need to be able to access \nagronomy and farm management skills where people have cropping \nknowledge and local biophysical environment knowledge. In Mckay’s \n(2020) Nuffield report, it is noted that there is no ‘recipe’ to grow cotton in \ntropical conditions, and the need for a highly responsive approach to \nmanagement. Furthermore, a CottonInfo fact sheet for Northern cotton \ngrowers notes: “The ability to contextualise advice to match local \nconditions is essential” (p.3), \n• Farm hand level: need access to skilled labour for both farm operations \nand to support R&D which could be more challenging in the more remote \nareas of Northern Australia, \n• Industry level support: need access to mechanics and technicians for \nprecision cropping equipment maintenance and repairs which is also \naffected by remoteness of areas, \n• Industry grower groups: the absence of collaborative grower groups in \nsome production areas can slow developmental progress, limiting peer-to-\npeer learning, inhibiting the shared management of risks required across \nthe valley such as adoption of IPM/stopping spray drift, and establishing a \nunified position to advocate for growers with other stakeholders in the \narea who may hold different ideological positions. \nFor this case study, people interviewed were working in the cotton industry in \nThe Ord (WA), The Douglas-Daly catchment area (NT), and across various trial \nsites in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. They included \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 123 \n \na researcher, a grower, an agronomist, and a farm hand. The findings of this \ninvestigation raise some discussion points to consider with regards to the future \nof the cotton industry in Northern Australia and confirm what has been \ncommunicated in the reporting of other research presentations and reports \n(Yeates, Grundy, Goldsmith, and Mckay, 2019; The CRC for Northern Australia’s \n(CRCNA), 2020).  As development continues, this region may prove significant \nfor the future Australian cotton industry. \nWho is being attracted to the industry? \nYeates, Grundy, Goldsmith & McKay (2019) have identified a typography of 5 \ncategories of people seeking to invest in cotton in the tropics, listed as: \n• Committed large farm developers connected to local communities with \naccess to land and irrigation water, \n• Existing land holders seeking to diversify their farm businesses, \n• Southern cotton growers seeking access to land holdings in geographical \nlocations unaffected by drought and water restrictions, consequently \nclimatically diversifying their operations, \n• Opportunists buying land for capital gain when cotton arrives, \n• Foreign investors. \nThe CRCNA (2020) notes that with regards to adapting existing business, “most \nvalue is realised when broadacre cropping is integrating with other enterprises, \nparticularly beef production” (p. 7).  The Grower interviewed for this case study \nwas working within a predominantly cattle focused business and explained the \nbenefits and reasons behind the addition of cotton cropping to this enterprise: \n(a) It is a profitable crop; other crops had been grown in the past for \nsilage, not to the same standards that cotton would require. The \nenterprise could afford the inputs and effort to grow cotton to a high \nstandard because it is a profitable crop, \n(b) In addition to the lint, cotton provided a value-add by-product of cotton \nseed for the cattle - “if we could get a cotton gin up and running, and \nthat seed stayed local out of the cotton gin, then it would be available \nto be sold throughout the region, negating the freight issue of bringing \nfeed supplements up from southern regions”, \n(c) Cotton was viable because the current genetics (Bollgard-3) allowed for \ncontrol of weeds that are abundant in the biophysical conditions of \nNorthern Australia.  \nFurthermore, he added, with reference to the broader industry, cotton grown \ncloser to the Northern border of Australia could mean cheaper export costs into \nvarious parts of South East Asia. \nOrientation and Attitude \nDiscussions with participants indicated that initial entrants who would contribute \nto the establishment of the industry needed to be entrepreneurial with the \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 124 \n \neconomies of scale to manage the initial capital costs (machinery and \nequipment) and persist through the learning curve costs (repeat trials and \npotential failures needed to make incremental gains in knowledge and practice). \nThe challenge for the cotton industry is that these types of people are not only \nconsidering cotton but are exploring multiple options to diversify agricultural \nbusinesses. Without adequate support to build the knowledge, practices and \nskills required to experience successes, or a consistent value proposition, these \npotential growers may turn their attention elsewhere. \nCotton is the crop that's working for us. But will it always be? Not \nnecessarily. When we get to a point where the price of cotton is such that \n(the value proposition changes) the next crop might be hemp, or the next \ncrop might be melons, or the next crop might be something else. Then we'll \ncertainly look at how we can grow that most highly valuable crop. - Grower \nFor southern growers/managers venturing north, an openness to experience (a \nwillingness to adapt to the difference of tropical cotton) and humility (a low \nsense of regard for the knowledge they have already attained in the south) are \nrequired as many aspects of cotton crop management do not transfer to tropical \nregions. The same goes for agronomists and consultants. \nGrowing cotton, where we are here is an entirely different experience to \ngrowing it down south. So the people with existing skill sets that come up to \ngrow it, they will have to learn. - Grower \nThe agronomists with a bit of Southern experience is great as long as they \ncan keep an open mind to how the crop is going to grow differently up here, \n-Agronomist \nFor the existing workforce in the North, these orientations and attitudes \n(openness to experience, humility and willingness to learn) are also important to \nadapt their skillsets from those required for working with cattle to broadacre \ncropping. Additionally, a worker’s level of conscientiousness and interest ensures \nthey will be engaged and attentive which is necessary for the progress of the \ncrop.  \nAs the Grower described: \nIt’s 100% attitude. If somebody wants to do the work, then I can teach \nthem what is involved with cotton. For example, I've got a guy who came to \nmy farming crew earlier this season and he's been part of the crop from \npre-crop fertilizer right through to now when we're just about to defoliate. \nHe is falling over himself to learn about the agronomy of the plant, what the \nmechanics are of getting enough seed in the ground and the plant out and \nup and getting it ready to harvest. His attitude is fantastic, and I couldn't be \nhappier with him. That's one individual case. Another case is one guy was \nhelping me and did nothing but complain about it. If they’re going to \ncomplain, they're not going to do the job right. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 125 \n \nThe interest in cotton that the first worker is described as having in the above \nquote is an important part of their motivation to build their own knowledge and \nincrease their skill and autonomy on farm. The farm hand interviewed described \nhow learning from the grower about the tasks associated with different stages of \nthe crop was enough to begin self-directed searching for information about the \nmachinery and approaches associated with these tasks. \nI heard (the grower) talking about it and he was telling me that's what I'm \ngoing to be doing in a couple of months’ time. So, I thought I'd start looking \nup to see what it's like, so I knew what I was expecting - Farm Hand \nConnections to the Knowledge Network and Broader Industry \nFor the agronomist interviewed, accessing skills development opportunities and \ndeveloping a peer network has been important for their ability to contribute to \nworking in the growing cotton industry in their local area. Activities included \ncompleting the University of New England Cotton Production course, conducting \ntrial work with more experienced researchers, visiting other cotton production \nvalleys, and joining the Crop Consultants Association.   \nFurthermore, cotton researchers working in tropical cotton played an important \nrole in the agronomist’s development by sharing their technical knowledge and \ntheir industry knowledge. These researchers helped to facilitate agronomist’s \nconnections with the wider established cotton industry. The value of these \nconnections was two-fold; accessing agronomy peers to discuss technical skills \ndevelopment and knowledge of cotton, and gaining an understanding of how \nthese consultants conduct their work and structure their business. \nInterviewer: What was good about your trip across to Central Queensland \nand Goondiwindi? \nAgronomist: Being about to talk to agronomists more about the details of \nthe job rather than the crop necessarily, but obviously, the crops as well. \nJust discussing how they relate to the clients. What their fee structures are \nlike. \nThe importance of this agronomist being connected to the wider industry was \nalso to share their expertise. This will be essential as the industry grows and \ndemand for agronomists in the north increases. The agronomist explains the \nimportance of developing the skills required to effectively communicate and \nconsult with growers: \nThere’s that challenge, when you get people that have come from a cotton \ngrowing area in the south to come to the north, and they're trying to grow \nthe crop almost the same way. You need to be able to have the knowledge \nand the confidence to be able to explain why that might not necessarily \nwork. \nThe grower interviewed was involved with the Northern Cotton Growers \nAssociation which has attracted members from the Douglas Daly and Katherine \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 126 \n \nregions in the NT, as well as The Ord, in WA. With these groups, growers \nrelocated from the south played an important role in supporting new local \nentrants.  \nIt's the southern skill set that we will need in management roles and \nadvisory roles. The farmers up here are intelligent and innovative. They're \nstruggling with that tyranny of distance, but they're really good operators. \nAnd they're all sponges for the information that's around at the moment. So \nif we get some good advice up here, these guys will take it on and they'll \nlearn it quite quickly. And then I think we'll be right. But initially we need \nsome Southern influence. - Grower \nAs previously mentioned, growers from the south will need to learn to grow \ncotton in the northern environments but they do bring baseline skills from which \nthey can develop expertise as they move through the learning curve of the \ntropics and a sense of self-efficacy for cotton growing which could help \nencourage others around them to feel more confident and supported in trialling \nthe crop. These growers also bring their connections to the cotton industry \nknowledge network and can facilitate introductions to help new entrants develop \ntheir skills and find answers to problems encountered when starting out. \nI take phone calls from other growers, wanting to know, what's the best \nway to handle something. And if I can't help them I can certainly direct \nthem to the people who do have the answer. The cotton industry is very \ncollaborative…. I don't know if the Cotton Growers Association has been \ninstrumental in getting cotton kicked off. I think all these guys were already \nlooking for that high value crop. But certainly, it hasn't hindered the \nprocess. I think it's probably been a good help to some people, we've been \nable to run some workshops and get some important people up here. - \nGrower \nTyranny of Distance: Lifestyle and planning the season \nThe phrase ‘the tyranny of distance’ is significant in developing Northern \nAustralia, as farming locations are classified as remote which brings challenges \nfor agricultural production. The implications of this with regards to workforce \ninclude the different lifestyle that comes from working in these areas and the \nchallenge this poses for attraction and retention. The implications with regards to \nworkforce knowledge and skills include the constraints that distance places on \naccess to resources required for cotton growing and needing to know how to \nmitigate the risks associated with this lower ease of accessibility when making \nplanning decisions for crop management. \nThe Grower describes the remoteness:  \nSo, pretty much all of the Northern Territory is a remote area. We are 190 \nkms from Darwin, we're about 220 kms from Katherine and we're 80 \nkilometres from the closest pub for example. If you wanted to leave the \nstation on Friday night and go and have a counter meal, well you've got a \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 127 \n \n160 km round trip to do it. So, the tyranny of distance is a major factor. \nThen you have to consider that all the people who are going to come and \nwork will have to live on the station pretty much. So, there'll be \naccommodation issues. There'll be a certain skill base (we need) and people \nwill need to be able to pay for that skillset. If you want a skillset that's been \nin cotton, you're going to have to be able to afford to pay them to come up \nand work up here. \nThe vastly different lifestyle that comes with the remote location can make it \ndifficult to attract people who are used to residing in the relatively more \npopulated areas of Southern Queensland and New South Wales..  \nThe Agronomist discussed this further: \nthe way we farm here is more like the irrigation on the east coast. So you \ncan get farming people from down in SW Western Australia coming up but \nit's a totally different system. But they understand what living in WA is like. \nAnd then if you get people from the east coast, they don't really understand \nwhat living in WA is like, but they probably have a better knowledge of the \nag system that we use here. We're kind of a little island I suppose in some \nways. \nWhen discussing attraction of the workforce with the agronomist, they described \na skilled position within the consulting business that had to be re-advertised a \nfew times prior to getting a suitable candidate. A perceived lack of services in the \ncommunity, e.g. suitable schooling for children, can lead people to leave the \nregion. Alternatively, the farm hand interviewed, who had been living relatively \nlocally to the station he worked on, described how services in the local \ncommunity were good and that locals could be attracted to work in farming over \nthe mining industry due to lifestyle factors. \nI come from town and most people here come from town. There's a lot of \npeople there that will do it (come to work in agriculture). Especially here, \nthere is a pretty good school… There is better money in the mines but for \nme personally the lifestyle here is a lot better than being in the mines. A lot \nof mates and family love coming out here. – Farm Hand \nThe grower, agronomist, and farm hand all described the lifestyle they had while \nworking in the North of Australia as personally desirable to them. Enjoying the \nremoteness, the landscape and the easy to access outdoor activities (camping, \nfishing, hunting) that were on offer in their backyard. Finding like-minded skilled \npeople that this lifestyle appeals to will be important for growth of the industry.  \n \nThe tyranny of distance and what this meant for freight costs while a gin had not \nyet been established has been well examined as a factor that limits the growth of \ncotton production. But the impact of distance on getting access to resources was \nalso a consideration for those working in cotton. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 128 \n \n…it's getting the commodities in too. Roads can be cut (by floods) in Central \nQueensland and stop you from getting fertilizer up to the Northern Territory. \nThe tyranny of distance…. we've got machinery dealerships that can help us \nokay, but nothing is overnight…It just doesn't happen that quickly up here. \nThe tyranny of distance is going to be a major factor in any development in \nNorthern Territory. - Grower \nThis raised the importance of trying to plan for what inputs are needed \nthroughout the cotton growing season or trying to keep spare machinery parts \non hand. \nyou've got to get all your fertilizer on board during the dry months…. if it's \non the highway during the wet months, and there's a particularly big storm \nsomewhere, it can be held up for one, two or three weeks. And a week in a \nlot of cases, particularly for cotton, can be far too long and can be the \ndifference between a good yield and a bad yield.- Grower \nSeasonal Differences: Workflow and labour demands \nThe cotton planting window in the North is such that some seasonal demand for \nworkers is in contrast to times in the Southern areas.  \nAs the Agronomist describes: \nFrom about April through to September we need other people to help, but \nit's only really those few months. But there's enough work to justify having \na couple of other crop scouts \nThis difference in labour demand could match up with off-peak times in the south \nand presents the potential for the cotton industry to organise for young people \non gap years or recent university graduates to rotate through different \nproduction valleys to gain diverse experiences and skills. However, the current \nCOVID-19 pandemic means movement of labour around the country is not \nstraight forward and this may not be possible until vaccinations are accessible to \nlarge parts of the community. The opportunity within this restriction is a greater \nfocus on upskilling of locals which could be a positive for the industry. \nSo previously, we've had crop scouts from New South Wales and \nQueensland. And they’ve been recruited more so through word of mouth \nrather than formal recruiting of people. But then this year we put out a \nrecruitment advertisement and we nearly had someone from Queensland \nbut that fell through when COVID happened and we ended up getting a \ncouple of locals \nWith cropping taking place over the wet season, it is possible that adaptable \nseasonal staff who are willing to work with both cattle and cropping could find \ntheir seasonal position become permanent. Whether workers would be willing to \nwork these hours year-round needs to be determined and this could be further \nexplored.  \nThe Grower discussed this further: \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 129 \n \nwe're trying to plant different crops during the wet season and that can be \nchallenging in itself. I'm much more permanent staff focused than itinerant \nworkers. In the farming sector, we'll probably want more workers during the \nwet season than the dry season. We'll have more workers coming in to do \nour fertilizing and planting during the wet season, and then as the crop \ngrows, we won't need so many. But at this stage, I think, you know, \ncurrently my number is two staff or two and a half staff for 300 hectares. \nThat would be the same out to maybe 800 to 1000 hectares. \nLack of Critical Mass: Implications for training \nOne of the challenges for skills development is that at the time of the interviews \nthere was a lack of critical mass that impacted the feasibility of offering in-person \nformal training programs to develop workforce skills.  \nAs the Agronomist described: \nThere's not enough people to get the interest. You'd either have to travel or \nget someone specifically here, and that does cost a lot. So that can be \ntricky. But I've done a lot of remote courses at times and the webinars that \npeople put out from time to time have been pretty handy \n \nWhile the critical mass is not yet there for formal training, the role that an \nexperienced person on farm and their ability to train people on-the-job plays is \nvery important for skill development of the on-farm workforce. Many cotton \nspecific on-farm skills, e.g. round bale picker machinery operation, may not be of \ninterest yet as having that machinery within a business is not yet feasible and \ntasks are outsourced to contractors. However, the grower interviewed felt that \nreaching a critical mass was not far off for their production valley.   \nHe discussed it further: \nI think (at the moment) it's probably on the job training for individuals. As \nwe move forward, there will be some industry training. For example, we'll \nhave a spraying workshop that all the guys who have the commercial \noperations up here and the individual farmers themselves can all get into \none room and we can all learn how to minimize our spray drift, how to do it \nbetter all the time. All those workshops that are used through the southern \nregions, freighting your cotton, best management practices, integrated pest \nmanagement, we will get to that we just don't have enough area or \nnumbers to be pushing it terribly hard just yet. Having said that we have all \ngone through the accreditation process to grow the Bollgard 3 cotton. So \nthe skills training will come. It's just very early days at this stage. That \ncritical mass is probably going to happen sooner rather than later. \nAs the industry becomes more established and a gin becomes part of the \ninfrastructure in the production area, local people will be able to see the bigger \nindustry that they belong to when they work in cotton. Understanding and seeing \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 130 \n \nthe process whereby their labour on farm becomes a product for export can be \nan important influencer on interest, attraction, and engagement of workforce. \nI'd like to see it processed in the gin. I reckon that would be pretty good. I \nthink the harvester is going to come here in the next couple of days. It'll be \ngood to see that machine working. I'd just like to see what they do and how \nto do it and how they separate the seeds out of the cotton. It would be \ninteresting. - Farm Hand \nPrecision Agriculture: Skills demands and trial experience \nAn adaptable and agile production approach is needed but requires investment in \nskills, and specialist equipment. In particular, skills around Integrated Pest \nManagement (IPM) was highlighted as very important. The different seasonal \nconditions mean there is very limited, if any, dormancy period for insects. Failure \nto control pests has been responsible for past failures to develop a cotton \nindustry in the North of Australia \nwe need to be on our insect pests much more than southern regions. -  \nGrower \nbeing aware of that IPM stuff is really important here, because we've got a \nhistory of resistance in heliothis. So it's something we've got to be really \nmindful of going into the cotton production. - Agronomist \nHaving a production area-wide IPM program and dedicated skilled staff to carry \nout these tasks is essential. In McKay (2020), the issues of pest and disease \nmanagement associated with ratoon cotton that exists when an operator has not \nploughed a headland properly were noted. This could be a lack of knowledge, a \nlack of skills, or a lack of engagement. \nUpskilling farm hands on how to scout for pests and bugs will help respond to \nany issues as they arise. The skilled agronomist and farm manager/grower both \nplay a role in developing employee knowledge in this area.  \nAs the farm hand described: \nI can't remember all the names of the bugs that we've got to look out for, \nwe'll take a photo and write a description. And then one of the agronomists \nwill come out here and go through and have a look. \nThe Northern context is such that precision agriculture practices are still being \nexplored and trialled. Growers’ skills and ability to conduct trial work on their \nfarms, exploring irrigation (if they are in an area that this is required/accessible) \nand the varied soil types across large properties is needed. When speaking to the \ngrower, it was clear they were embracing the opportunity to develop sustainable \napproaches suited to their environments and not simply transferring approaches \nthat had been used in the south. Irrigation systems being explored included \nlateral move irrigators, centre pivot irrigation, and subsurface drip tape. \nGrower on soil types: \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 131 \n \nthere's certainly different soil types over the station and we'll be \ninvestigating what the best soil types are for the dryland crop and then a \nrainfed/irrigated crop \nOn irrigation approaches: \nwe can grow it here without having to build the big irrigation dams. You'll \ngrow a rain fed crop with less water and you'll get less yield. But the point \nbeing that you can still get a substantial yield and you don't have to chase \nyields at all costs (because the crop is a profitable one). Nobody wants to \ndestroy these natural pristine waterways up here…. we’ve got a terrific \nopportunity in the Northern Territory to get our irrigation systems right…. \nNow we do know better. And as we develop new areas, we've got a great \nopportunity to get it right. \nDigital Agriculture: Adoption challenges \nAs with other regional and remote areas of Australia, connectivity remains a \nmajor hurdle to any adoption of digital agriculture. This may be exacerbated in \nNorthern Australia. When discussing this issue, the agronomist further \nhighlighted the importance of connectivity and GPS for safety reasons when \nworking in isolated environments. \neveryone talks about developing the north and, and that's fabulous. But the \nfurther you get away from a town site, the less likely Telstra is to put up a \ntower. So, then you've got to find other ways of connecting via Wi Fi or \nsatellite. And also, it becomes as a safety thing for us too. We're out in the \nmiddle of a cotton crop. You know, if we fall down then no one's going to be \nable to find us. Those sorts of things. So having little GPS trackers or \nsomething with us so that, you know people can at least find you in an \nemergency is important. - Agronomist \nA local area network (LAN) was helping the grower to use as much digital \ntechnology as was possible within their operation.  \nwe don't (have good connectivity). We have a mobile service in very limited \nareas over the station. We are using as much technology as connectivity will \nallow at this stage. We're doing things like yield monitoring and yield \nmapping with the harvesters. We're monitoring soil moisture, and soil \nnutrient levels. We have satellite imagery of the crops. We've actually got a \nlocal area network on the station that we've paid for jointly with a CRC \nproject to collect all this information digitally so that it all comes back to a \ndashboard. – Grower \nIt was also made clear that technology needed to serve a purpose and provide a \nrelative advantage to manual methods.  \nDigital agriculture definitely has its place, but we shouldn't think that's the \nonly way we can do it. It's just another tool We're employing the use of \ntechnology as much as we can, not just for the sake of it, but if it returns a \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 132 \n \nbenefit to us. So that we don't have to drive out to the paddock, you know, \nat two o'clock in the morning to check an irrigator well, then absolutely we'll \nemploy the use of that technology. \nIn terms of the skills to utilise digital technology, the Grower reported that digital \nliteracy was not an issue: \nCertainly not in my own experience. The team we've got are all up to speed \nwith that. And I include everybody in that, from the most junior jackaroo to \nthe most senior plant operator. Everybody would be right up to speed with \nthe use of touchscreens in machinery or with the technology that we use. Or \nhave no problem learning it. \nSocial Licence and Stakeholder Engagement \nNew entrants will need to be able to advocate for cotton to be grown in Northern \nAustralia as there is at times an emotional as opposed to evidence-based \ndiscourse within sectors of the community that may challenge this crop choice. \nPeople may be opposed to the growing of cotton due to perceptions about \ngenetically modified crops, water and chemical use. The more local people can \nbecome involved in the industry, the more opportunity there is to build trust and \ndisseminate accurate information about growing cotton. \npeople who don't know a lot about it tend to form their views from what has \nbeen in the media about cotton - that it's all bad. There are people that you \nwill never change their opinion, but I've had a lot of opportunities to explain \nto people, even to my friends, the history of cotton in this area and then \nwhy this GM technology is good and how it's not that water hungry plant. -\n \nAgronomist \nEngagement with local communities and presenting a unified message will be \nneeded. The organisation of grower groups such as the North Australia Cotton \nGrowers Association may help represent the industry in discussions with others \nwho hold opposing views. \nSummary and Conclusion \nThe main findings from the case study include: \n• People capability is a potential limiting factor for expansion of the Northern \ncotton industry. \n• New entrants need to have an entrepreneurial orientation and accept the \nlearning curve costs. \n• The skills that people from the southern valleys bring to the north is \nvaluable in supporting new entrants to the industry. However, these \ngrowers and workforce need to be willing to adapt and relearn farming \npractices for the new context \n• Connecting people working in the Northern regions with peers in other \ncotton growing regions is essential for their professional development \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 133 \n \n• Seasonal differences provide an opportunity for seasonal workforce to \nmove between Northern and Southern valleys. This could be particularly \nuseful for young graduates seeking diverse experiences in the industry. \n• Trial experience skills will be important for establishing cotton in the North \n• Structural issues including the tyranny of distance and connectivity issues \nassociated with remoteness are challenges for the industry. Workforce \nimplications include difficulty accessing training and a lack of infrastructure \nto use digital technology. \n• The cotton industry will need to effectively build relationships with diverse \nstakeholders to establish and maintain social licence. \nAn opportunity exists to grow the cotton industry with the expansion of \nbroadacre cropping in Northern Australia. New varieties of cotton mean it is a \nviable choice, economically it is profitable, and it is complimentary to current \nproduction systems with cattle. However, workforce capacity could be a \nconstraint to expanding production. A combination of attracting those with \nprevious experience in the cotton industry to northern locations and upskilling \nlocal people is needed. Those growers who do venture north need to be open to \nhaving their existing knowledge and practices challenged. Developing people’s \nskills to trial different approaches to growing cotton is required as best practices \nmay look different within new contexts. Collaboration between researchers, \nagronomists, growers/managers and on-farm workforce is required. This serves \nto generate the knowledge required to advance an industry in the North and to \nconnect new entrants to broader networks and supports. Investment in solutions \nto telecommunications challenges is needed to ensure these remote operations \ncan access digital technology to assist production. Skilled communication and \ncommunity engagement will be essential. Presenting a unified industry position \nthat can gain support from diverse stakeholders is required to ensure social \nlicense is established and maintained. \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 134 \n \nChapter Seven: Dalara Pastoral Case Study: \nSetting up structures and processes to build \na socially sustainable farming business. \nIntroduction \nRob Davies is the farming manager in his family’s mixed-commodity agriculture \nbusiness, Dalara Pastoral. The business consists of three properties located near \nDenman in the Upper Hunter Valley, Walcha in the southern part of the New \nEngland Tableland and Blackville on the Liverpool plains. Cattle are run across all \nfarms with sheep also being run at Walcha. A cropping operation at Blackville \nsees the production of durum wheat, chickpeas, sorghum, and cotton across an \narea of 2,800 hectares. Cotton is grown as a dryland crop and has been in their \ncropping program since 2014, missing 19/20 growing season due to drought. In \naddition to farm management, Rob is the acting chair for the strategic \ndevelopment side of the business and is involved in the financial management \nwith his father, Allan Davies. \nRob was sought to offer his perspective for this case study as no previous \nparticipants were engaged in dryland cropping and most were majority broadacre \ncropping businesses. This bias lead to a narrow focus of the future of work \ninvolving conversations about workforce development in relation to automated \nirrigation and teams consisting of 4 people or more. The cropping operation at \nBlackville requires only one or potentially two workers in addition to Rob acting \nas the farm manager. He has offered his perspective on workforce development \ndiscussing the different approaches taken when expanding the broader Dalara \nPastoral business from 2008 onwards, which does include developing workforce \ninvolved with the cattle side of the business.  \nHighlighted in the discussion was the strategic way Rob and his family were \ntaking actions to ensure a sustainable farming business that will endure and \ngrow into the future. This included structures set-up that value diversity of \nthought in decision making. Approaches to attract, hire, develop and retain \nworkforce and the values that set the workforce culture added to the social \nsustainability of the business. Sustainability was also clear in the way succession \npathways were clearly defined to progress within the family business. \nPersonal Development \nEarly Career Work Experiences \nRob first started working in the cotton industry in the mid 1990’s in his last \nsummer of high school, working on a family friend’s farm in the Moree area. He \ncontinued working for the next few years on cotton farms including having had \nthe opportunity to work for Tony May (who was then managing a farm and is \nnow the Head of Customer Marketing, ANZ for Bayer) and for Frank Hadley’s \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 135 \n \ndaughter, Alice Cameron (nee Scott). Frank is credited as one of the pioneers of \nthe Australian cotton industry. Working for these knowledgeable and highly \nrespected people, he developed his appreciation for the history of the cotton \nindustry and the culture of continuous improvement that exists, commenting: \nI still attribute my love for cotton to that time and learning to work to try to \nget the most out of the plant. I'm pretty passionate about it… It's a really \ngood industry to be involved with.  \nThese experiences meant that Rob had the confidence, skills, and supportive \nnetwork to adopt cotton including it in the cropping rotation (rainfall permitting) \nwhen later returning to the family farming business in 2008. \nFormal Training and Further Career Development \nRob attended Marcus Oldham College completing his associate diploma in farm \nmanagement. This program has a reputation within the agricultural workforce as \nbeing highly relevant for developing the knowledge and skills of farm managers. \nGraduates are sought after and very employable. While initially aspiring to \ncomplete the degree, career opportunities were present, and Rob pursued the \nopportunity to further develop his skills while working in the USA for Nippon Meat \nPackers Australia. As Rob explains: \nI had to choose a career path or getting a uni degree. I just weighed up the \npros and cons of where I was going to end up and it just fell in that \ndirection. \nThis situation is not uncommon. When career opportunities become available \nthat are not reliant on a qualification, but on the skillset, experience and ability \nof the individual, and through these career opportunities the individual has \nopportunities to further develop their skillset, then continuing formal study may \nnot be the viable choice for individuals in agriculture. As has been highlighted in \nprevious case studies, this is one reason that measuring highest qualification is \nan imperfect metric of skills and abilities for the cotton industry social \nsustainability report.  \nOngoing Development and Training \nIn addition to education and work experiences, Rob regularly seeks to stay up to \ndate on new farming practices or technologies through field days. He also reflects \non skills gaps and identifies areas for development, then seeks out subject \nmatter experts or short courses that can develop these skills. This attitude to \npersonal development of knowledge and skills is extended to the opportunities \nthat are provided to the workforce within the farm business. \nWe are always looking at bettering our knowledge in the arena that we're \nfocusing on. I'm constantly looking at different field days to attend and \ndifferent technologies in the marketplace. Whether it's about tractor \ntechnology, updated trials with cotton, wheat, chickpeas and sorghum, I \ntry and get to as many of those as I can… And then any other courses that \nI feel are relevant \nAn example of industry-based training included undertaking the Rabobank \nExecutive Development Program himself while also upskilling the cattle farm \nmanager by enrolling him in the Rabobank Farm Managers Program. More \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 136 \n \nrecently, he had identified a need to develop inter-generational communication \nskills for managing younger staff members. For this, he had engaged the \nexpertise of a consultant to come and deliver some training to himself and other \nfarm managers.  \nCollaboration and the Knowledge Network \nRob highlighted the value that comes from having good, collaborative \nrelationships with other growers in the area, in particular the growers from the \nneighbouring properties. Dalara Pastoral participates in a benchmarking group \nwith these growers and has collaborated on sourcing training together. \nWe do a lot with those guys in terms of benchmarking, but also, just \ngeneral open chat about how the business is performing, what issues \nwe're facing. We were talking the other day, and (the issue of \nintergenerational communication) was one that we identified being an area \nfor improvement. So we contacted a training provider and they’re coming \ndown to meet with us in person. \nIn terms of farm management, Rob utilizes an agronomist who specialises in dry \nland cotton and who introduces new science driven ideas to the strategic \nmanagement of the crop.   \n…it's a dual effort…. The agronomist is cooking up the chemistry and \ntelling you why he's doing a certain thing and what he's up to and what \nbenefits it may have. He's on the scientific side, and you are the eyes and \nears in the paddock, seeing different areas and relaying information. \nHow does the grower ensure the future of the business? \nOrientation to Work: A custodian mindset and engagement at work \nRob described an approach to work that could fit the description of a custodian \nmindset. He and his family take care of and act in service to the business. This \nmeans they are building their business with a larger vision than their own \ncareers, wants and needs in mind. This mindset underpins their approach to farm \nmanagement and business management. \nMy brother and I see ourselves as caretakers. So, you might have an asset \n(the farm) worth millions of dollars but we see ourselves as caretakers \nrather than individual owners of those assets. We essentially have a view \nthat my brother and I are going to be at the helm, working together in a \ncaretaking role for future generations of our family.  \nUnderpinning the mindset of a custodian, the value of care aligns to the way \nwork expectations are set for staff on their farms. \nFrom a paddock perspective, we like to have our farms in a very clean and \ntidy nature. That's of utmost value to us. Because once we get it clean, \nand tidy around the working areas, paddocks, green areas, even, you \nknow, having short grass around the paddocks or all sorts of different \nthings that this leads into a mindset that “it's well maintained”. It gives us \neasy to access everything. Everything's clean cut. It's very structured. \nThere's no mess lying around. All the rubbish is picked up. There's no \nclutter around sheds or around silos. All fence lines are sprayed and all \nthat sort of stuff. That's one of our biggest values on our farms is having a \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 137 \n \ntidy workspace and a tidy farm. Because it sets a mindset with the fellow \nemployees and guys that you work with that this is how we want this \nbusiness to be run, in a very clean manner. \nThis perhaps not only reflects a custodian approach to work in terms of care, but \nalso an expectation for employees to be fully engaged in work and to do the job \nproperly. Rob noted that this approach to work was also important for how he \nmanaged to effectively switch focus and engage in his family life.  \nFrom my personal perspective, the core values that are strongly held are \nto do the job properly and efficiently. Don't cut any corners. And I also \ntake this approach with the family side of things... there's a very fine line \nbetween work and family and I try and separate the two as much as I can. \nAnd spend as much time in the family arena as I do in the workplace, \nmaking the quality of that time really effective and efficient. Which is \nreally important because if you don't do that, you keep thinking about \ndifferent things all the time to do with work and you don't get to rest.  \nAs described above, this is more than time management, it is energy \nmanagement. It is not simply about where people are (work/home) and what \nthey are doing (tasks and activities), but how they are being present and \nattentive while in these domains of their life; allowing quality engagement with \nfamily and recovery from work, so an individual can then bring their best self to \nwork.  \nThis custodian mindset (as opposed to ownership) also extends to the way the \nDalara Pastoral business has been structured in terms of decision-making \nprocesses with the implementation of the board. It allows some detachment to \nplace and for more objective decisions to made in the interest of the future \ngrowth and survival of the business. Rob explains further: \nAlthough I’ve got a heavy connection to the land, after living here for 12 \nyears, if Blackville wasn't performing, and it was a real thorn in our side, \nwe'd have to make the decision to move on.  \n \nWorkforce Structures in the Business \nDecision Making Structures: The use of a board \nDalara Pastoral is one of several businesses that Rob and his family own and \noperate and has a corporate structure with the implementation of a board. Rob’s \nparents are directors, and the board also consists of two external directors. \nThese two external directors bring perspectives shaped from their experiences in \nother industries outside of agriculture to the business. Rob reports to the board \nand executes the strategic direction set by the board on farm. Within the farming \nbusiness, the managers form a committee to co-ordinate activities that align with \nthe business strategic direction, effectively utilise resources from other aspects of \nthe business, and provide information about the daily operations. Regular \nmeetings and reviews are part of the way work is planned and executed, as Rob \nexplains: \nPutting these processes in place, into our farming businesses allow us to \nnot only maximise synergies in terms of the other businesses we own but \nalso to cross check what we're up to and put some guidelines around what \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 138 \n \nwe're doing and how we're doing it. Making it formalized, with a process to \nfollow means everything is very clearly laid out. \nThe use of the board, with the diverse expertise of directors, allows for more \nobjective and ultimately better decision making to occur to ensure the growth \nand survival of the business. These structures and processes mean threats and \nopportunities are regularly identified and managed. The willingness to adapt is \npart of the business and informed by multiple perspectives. \nIt just takes all of emotion out of it… say the operations at one of our \nfarms have a serious downturn, you know they revoke water licenses \naltogether and we've got no water and it's been a bad performer for five \nyears. There's nothing to say that we don't go 'we're out of there, let's cut \nties and move to a different arena'. Yeah, it's, driven by performance…So \nthat, I suppose, ensures our survival going forward to a degree. At least \nwe think that gives us our best chance and so it’s a concept (the farm \nboard structure) that we’ve adopted. \nSuccession Planning: A skilled pathway to greater responsibility \nThe custodian mindset and more formal corporate-like structure also influences \nthe succession planning for the business: a key activity to ensure the future of \nthe farming operations. The Davies family have been proactive in planning this, \ncoming to an agreement that the business exists as a whole and won’t be divided \nupon transitioning to the next generation. The management of the business is \ndone at the board level and a clear skilled pathway for transition of board \ndirectors laid out.  \nFor my brother and I to step up and my parents to step down, (my brother \nand I) we have to complete a securities course and do a directorship \ncourse and meet other requirements. We have to tick a heap of boxes \nfrom our family side as well in terms of executing financial agreements. \nIt's really clear cut where that path is to become a director of our \nbusiness\n. \nThis approach strengthens the sustainability of the business ensuring adequate \nskills are developed and experiences gained to take on the greater responsibility \nthat comes with being a director. This structure and plan reduces the risk of \nnegative impacts on the future of the family business that come with a less clear \nsuccession plan. \nOur family has agreed that we want the business to continue into future \nyears. I am a very heavy believer in that structure because it cuts out any \nfamily degradation in terms of in-fighting or any interpersonal issues. \nPeople know where they stand, they know what job they have got to do. \nAnd in time we will hire, whether it be a family member or not, someone \nto step into a financial role in the business or decide who will fill a certain \nrole in the business. Rather than informally saying I’ll handle this and my \nbrother will handle something else, it's a hired position that if we want to \ngo for that position, we have to put in our resume, go through the \ninterview process with the directors and the management board makes a \ndecision. I believe that, in itself, is a fairly strong concept to ensure that \nthis business lasts for generations, not just one generation and then it’s \ncarved apart by my kids or my brother's kids, essentially. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 139 \n \nAttraction, Development, and Management of workforce to Retain \nKnowledge and Skills \nThe workforce on the property that Rob oversees includes one or two full time \nstaff who may also move between the broad acre cropping and cattle aspects of \nthe business. On-farm tasks include planting, crop management and storage \nworks. Contractors are used for spraying, harvesting, and picking tasks.  \nAttraction and Hiring of Workforce \nDalara pastoral consists of a number of workers who have been associated with \nthe business from the onset of operations at the different properties. Having \ngood knowledge of the local environmental conditions was strongly valued and \nworkforce with ties to the community brought a greater likelihood of retention as \nthese workers had built relationships and fulfilling lives in this location. Real \nworld experience is essential beyond any formal training at tertiary institutions. \nyou can sit in a classroom for as long as you like, but if you don't have the \non-farm training and experience with the seasons and the weather \npatterns, and you know what the crop’s doing and what the cattle are \nfeeling…. that piece of paper doesn't matter to us. Essentially, we're \nlooking for that environment skillset, it was really important to get that \nright. \nWhen there have been some shorter-term seasonal demands for labour, they \nhave been able to look to the local community and upskill them on-the-job. \nWe also have given guys a go for menial tasks who have no skillset at all \nwhatsoever. Like a local guy who occasionally during the drought came \nand worked for us. He had no formal training in the farming arena. He \ncould drive machinery but had no livestock skills or anything like that. So \nhe went straight into some machinery type roles, helping us feed out on \nloaders. That suited him. We also gave him an opportunity in the trucks I \ngave him a bit of on-farm training as well. \nLocal workers have the benefit of already belonging to the community and this \nmeans they will be easier to retain. These workers still need to go through a \nscreening process prior to being hired that involves an assessment testing \nnumeracy, literacy, and behaviours in different scenarios. This assessment is \nconducted through a consultant.  \nThe skillset for on-farm workforce has also changed as the business adapted and \nexpanded. When a skilled family member was working on a property, they could \nafford to fill labour requirements with a lower-skilled local worker but this \nchanged when the operation grew and family transitioned away from being on-\nsite. Rob explains: \nIt required a whole new skillset. So we had a contractor that used to work \nfor us who did a lot of contracting farming & hay making for us. We spoke \nto him at length and his wife, and we ended up buying his contracting \nbusiness and then put him on as manager. Because he came to us with, \nagain, the environment factor of knowing the land inside and out but also \nknowing the district and having family support, and relationships within \nthe community. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 140 \n \nDevelopment and Management of Workforce \nManagement of staff reflected the grower’s orientation, values and expectations \nwithin the business. For example, similar to Rob’s approach to upskilling for \nhimself, staff are also supported to upskill. \nI think it's very important, you know, for the cotton industry to be offering \nup plenty of training programs and development opportunities, but the \nonus is on the farmer to allow his employees to attend this type of \ntraining… At a base level all our employees do a chemical course, a first \naid course. Any ticket that they want to pursue or further education in the \nag sector we will support wholly and solely., And we'll give them time off \nto do that. \nStaff are managed to complete their work in alignment with the workplace values \nof caretaking and have clearly communicated high performance standards set for \nthem.  The accomplishment that comes with this helps to develop their intrinsic \nmotivation. Supporting them to feel valuable and that their efforts matter adds \nto this sense of satisfaction. As Rob describes: \nwe think about it, we don't rush too much. We make sure we finish the job \nthat we're working on at that time. We don't leave one thing go onto \nanother, pending weather situations, obviously. But we usually like to get \none thing tied up so it's complete and it's all in sync. Yeah it just works. \nAnd it gives everyone a good feeling. They can drive around and feel \nproud that they've been a part to make the place look how it looks, you \nknow, and I believe it makes for a nicer environment. \nThe organisational support that is offered within the business extends beyond \ndeveloping staff competency and valuing their work to also care for their \nwellbeing.  \nI think health and well-being with our managers is also important. It’s \noffered up to have yearly, comprehensive health checks done in Sydney, \nso they can keep on top of their game and make sure they're fit and \nhealthy. \nThe commitment to have a quality life at work and a quality life at home, as \ndiscussed in Rob’s approach to managing his own time and energy also extends \nto ensuring staff can achieve this.  \nFamily and working environment is huge for our business and giving guys \ntime off to go and see their kids play sports and all that sort of stuff…That \nis one of the bigger parts of our business I suppose \n \nEngagement with the Next Generation \nDalara Pastoral add to the social sustainability of the agriculture industry by \ninvesting in a scholarship for a student attending Marcus Oldham to complete \nwork experience within their business. This financial support helps these \nindividuals to complete their studies.  \nEssentially, it gives us a gateway to that next generation… We try and \nrotate these young kids through and give them experience. We believe \nthat if you don't spend the time with them, well, the future of ag is looking \nbleak if you can't give these kids good on-farm experiences. We have to \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 141 \n \nwork with them a little bit in terms of their experience range and we give a \nlot of on-farm training at the same time \nThe preference to support this tertiary institution is associated with Rob’s \nalumnus status and the calibre of students admitted entrance to the programs on \noffer. Marcus Oldham entry requirements stipulate that students have completed \nat least 12 months in an industry placement and prefer students to have had \nexposure to two or more farming systems. This means students come prepared \nwith a baseline of skills that make them more employable than agriculture \nstudents who have no prior on-farm experience.  \nThey are a cut above the rest to be frankly honest with you... Most kids \nhave already had two years off in the workforce out of school, so when \nthey go to Marcus Oldham, they're usually about 21 or 22 years old. \nThey're not green as green….I think due to their past experiences when \nthey're kids growing up on farm or having gone out to do work experience \non farm, they come to us knowing even just simple things and already \nhave those practical abilities.  \n \nThe most recent mid-year student employed for 2021 at Blackville  had grown up \nfarming in Tasmania and had no prior knowledge of the cotton industry. In \nfurther comment on her hiring, Rob noted the several employability skills that \ncontributed to her being the successful candidate. These included good \ncommunication skills, curiosity and asking the ‘right questions’ that \ndemonstrated her existing knowledge and the personal goals she had set for \nwhat she wanted to learn from the experience. \nIt’s their mindset, ...this young girl, she was very proactive, she's only 20 \nand she was asking the sort of questions that didn't make us go 'oh wow \nshe's probing' but instead say 'Ok well this girl's in tune. She wants to \nknow what's happening. What her employment conditions are going to be \nlike’. She was really honing in on a few key points. ‘How big is the \noperation? What do we do?’ You know, she was really finding out enough \nabout it. That makes you confident that she’s going to come on to the job \nand she’s going to be asking questions all the time, which is what you \nwant.  \n \nSimilar to the impact that Rob’s early career experience in the cotton industry \nhas had on his current career, providing an opportunity for a young aspiring farm \nmanager to gain experience on a farm that grows cotton may give the next \ngeneration the confidence to implement this crop choice on properties that they \nmanage in the future, or to actively seek out employment on a farm that \ncurrently grows cotton. This type of ongoing scholarship program benefits Dalara \nPastoral and the wider industry.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 142 \n \nPotential Threats or Constraints to the Future of the Business \nWhen discussing potential threats or constraints to the future of the farm \nbusiness, Rob raised the issue of the costs associated with purchasing dryland \ncountry. Land prices being sufficiently high such that the cost of land could stop \nfarming families (who need to see a profit fairly quickly to have an income) from \nexpanding, leaving it only as an option for larger corporates/super funds who are \nlooking at a longer-term investment and can take the risk on returns. \nWe are currently assessing how we incorporate capital gain into the review \nprocess when looking at overall farm profitability. We have previously \nfocused on ROI (return on investment) leaving capital gain figures to one \nside. The increase in current land values are painting a picture that we \ncannot ignore the introduction of capital gain increases into our \nprofitability picture. How we do this is still up for discussion as we need to \nhome in on ROI to keep costs at a minimum whilst maintaining best \nachievable yield and price for our grain/lint. \nAt the time of our interview Dalara Pastoral was utilising the experience of a \nbusiness consultant to better understand how to assess potential expansion \nopportunities that factor in land value and capital gains, and to set some \nguidelines to identify future opportunities to grow the business. In terms of \nconsidering the future of the cotton industry workforce, access to up-to-date \nbusiness skills or opportunities to upskill in specific business knowledge areas \nmay be of importance for cotton growers to manage the future of their farms. \nSummary and Conclusion \nThe main findings from this case study include: \n• A growth mindset and a collaborative knowledge network help growers to \nidentify and engage with professional development opportunities. \n• A custodian mindset helps to take a strategic view of the farm business \nand the value of ‘care’ extends from the business through to people \nmanagement and sets expectations for job performance standards. \n• Setting clear structures for decision making and career progression in the \nfamily business improves the sustainability of the business for future \ngenerations. \n• Diverse perspectives from within industry and outside of the industry \nassist with strategic management of the business. \n• Supporting staff to upskill and recruiting from the local community \ncontribute to retention of valued workforce. \n• Establishing of a partnership with a tertiary education institution means \nthe business is providing the next generation with quality career \nexperiences. This initiative will also have a positive impact for the cotton \nindustry as young people increase their skills and knowledge required to \nwork in the cotton industry. \nFrom the interview with Rob Davies it is clear that the future of farming is not \nsolely centred around the transition to digital farming practices in the cotton \nindustry. Adaptation and sustainability for the industry into the future also means \nsetting in place business practices that help families benefit from diverse \nexpertise beyond their own to inform the strategic direction and development of \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 143 \n \ntheir enterprises. Farming faces complex systematic challenges and this requires \na range of expertise beyond that of any one individual.  \nClear structures and values that facilitate good communication, team functioning, \nand support of upskilling means people know what is expected of them, how to \nbe a good contributor to the business and have opportunity to progress in their \nability to be a valued member of the team. Identification of the skills required to \nsuccessfully lead within a farming business and moving towards merit-based \npathways are one way to bring greater objectivity to the succession transitions \nthose businesses make. A custodian mindset means people can separate the \nbusiness needs from their emotional attachments.  \nDalara Pastoral’s strategy to engage directly with a tertiary agricultural \ninstitution is one way to provide pathways for the next generation, including \nthose with no prior exposure to the cotton industry. These students have a \nsupported entry point to learn through experience and build relationships with \nthose already in the industry. It is expanding the students’ professional network, \nfamiliarizing them with the environmental conditions of the farms the Davies \nfamily manage, and giving them the experience of living in cotton farming \ncommunities. As noted with the attraction strategy for the Dalara Pastoral \nworkforce, this environmental knowledge and sense of community belonging, \nand familiarity is important in selecting staff who are likely to be committed to \nworking within this business longer term. This financial support through the \nscholarship removes barriers for interested and enthusiastic young people to \ndevelop their confidence and skills on a cotton cropping operation. For those with \nno prior experience in cotton it may switch them on to the possibilities of \nincluding a cotton crop rotation (if climatically suitable) for farms that they \nmanage in the future. Grower-led initiatives such as this, benefit the whole \ncotton industry. \n  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 144 \n \nChapter Eight: Columboola Cotton Case \nStudy: Approaching the threat to find the \nopportunity. \nIntroduction \nAshley and Bec Geldard own and operate Columboola Cotton, with a broadacre \ncropping property, Cullingral, near Miles on the Darling Downs. This farm has \nbeen owned by the Geldard family since 1909, and Ash is a fourth-generation \ngrower. Cullingral was a dryland property until 2013, when an arrangement was \nmade with Origin to use treated water from their coal seam gas operations for \nirrigation. The property has been developed to now grow up to 660ha of irrigated \nand 130ha of broadacre crops including cotton, durum, wheat, mung beans. In \nthe 2019-2020 season 160ha of cotton was produced.  \nThe Geldard’s have developed the business over the years for Ash to be able to \ntake on a more strategic role, Bec to manage the accounting, and they currently \nemploy a farm manager to oversee day-to-day operations. An agronomist \nconsults with them on crop management and contractors are used for spraying, \nharvesting and transporting tasks on farm. Ash’s perspective was sought for this \ncase study as his experiences give insight into transitioning a smaller farm (less \nthan 1000ha) to incorporate digital technologies and the impacts this has had on \nthe workforce requirements of the business. Furthermore, in this case study, he \ndiscusses the experiences that have developed his skills, the attraction, \ndevelopment and management of his on-farm employee, his own transition from \nbeing in the day-to-day on-farm operations to a more strategic leadership role \nand working to manage threats and opportunities within his business. \nPersonal Development \nAsh returned to the farm after completing high school and has worked his way \nfrom the role of machinery operator into the business management side when \nthe accounting transitioned to be managed through digital systems in the early \n2000’s. He and his wife have taken ownership through a gradual succession \nprocess from 2003 to 2012. He has developed his skills and abilities in several \nways including tertiary education and seeks out short courses to upskill in \nvarious areas including personal development around soft skills, people \nmanagement and leadership skills.  \nI have done some courses on communication and negotiation... That was a \nreally interesting one. And not just for the business side of it, but more \nimproving my own ability to be resilient and levelheaded…getting a clear \nperspective on how important that can be. \nExperiential learning has been a significant part of Ash’s skills-development. In \nour discussion the following contexts and situations were discussed that have \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 145 \n \nchallenged him and resulted in the growth of his ability as cotton farm business \nowner:  \n(a) on-the-job by working within the business as well as setting up and \nrunning his own businesses separate to the farm,  \n(b) adopting a leadership role in negotiations with coal seam gas companies.  \nWhen representing the cotton industry such as with the Basin Sustainability \nAlliance, an organisation that represents stakeholders in coal seam gas \ndevelopment, mentorship from other growers and leaders of industry have been \nbeneficial for his development. \nthat Basin Sustainability Alliance that I was involved… we were the group \ntrying to form that link between the different stakeholders. Some of the \npeople that I was working with on that committee were amazing people to \nbe around and to see how they operated. I got a little bit of mentoring \nfrom being involved in that. So that was really instrumental as well…they \nwere very generous in sharing their knowledge and giving me an insight \ninto how a lot of business is done at that level and how governments \nactually work with business at that scale. That was a great thing to be a \npart of. \n \nSimilar to innovation orientations described by other growers, in discussions \nabout developing the knowledge and skills required to implement automation on \nhis farm Ash noted that humility and an openness to experience was required to \nscale the learning curve. \n \nI think the biggest thing I had to do is just learn to completely drop my \nego and admit that I know nothing about this, say “tell me what I need to \nknow”. Just ask questions and not be afraid to look like an idiot and not be \nworried about what people might think about your lack of knowledge on a \nsubject. You learn a lot more once you can admit what you don't know.  \n \nSetting up the Business for Social Sustainability \nMindset and Transition of Responsibilities: Drop the ego and learn to delegate. \nI think a strong business is a business that can work without you in it. And \nwhen I really looked at our business, it was set up so that without me in it, \nit was not going to work. \nAsh has worked to change his business and his role within in it so that his work is \nsustainable. He has redesigned his job to allow him to manage the key aspects of \nwork that require his input and balance work with his commitments to his family, \nwhich are a major priority at this stage of his and his children’s lives. These \nchanges have been motivated by a need to manage not just his time, but his \nenergy so he can be present and at his best in both main roles in his life, work \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 146 \n \nand home. Ash describes some of the personal development training he has done \nthat helped him understand and focus on this. \n…learning about reprioritising and making sure that when you’re \ndedicating time to something, you’re in a position to be at your best rather \nthan spending a lot of hours running it at 30 or 40% your capacity. \nRedesigning his role in the business is not a simple change. It requires a shift in \nmindset to let go of some of the on-farm operations.  \nThat was a bit of a challenge…to try to pass on all the knowledge that I've \nbeen guarding, thinking how important I was, and be able to upskill other \npeople and remove myself from being such an integral part of that. So \nthat was a decent challenge. Once I could do that, then my time was freer \nto spend either working on the business and improving aspects that I just \ndidn't have time to do before and hadn’t realised were as important as \nwhat they actually are, or be able to spend time with my kids and be part \nof their life as they grow up. Which I was struggling to do as I was always \nat the beck and call of what was required on a day-to-day basis farming-\nwise. \nThe willingness to let go of responsibilities and trust his farm manager to do the \nwork has allowed Ash to do the strategic work for his businesses, including the \nfarm business, to adapt and succeed into the future, and to balance the other \npriorities in his life. Learning to delegate was acknowledged as a skill to be \ndeveloped: \nOne of the biggest skills that I've had to learn as a manager is to let go of \nthat tendency to want to try to micromanage and not hand over some of \nthat responsibility. \nHe reflected on the development of this skill and the cognitive process that \ninfluences individuals’ abilities to make this transition. Banford, Buckley, and \nRoberts (2014) have described how “delegation in a local context is a function of \nthe global leader’s cognitions and perceptions of their subordinates” (p.646). It is \ninfluenced by the culture of the workplace, through learned beliefs, social norms, \nas well as managers’ perceptions of themselves and their workforce. Ash \ndescribes the process of challenging beliefs about control and one’s unique \ncapability in order to change this behaviour. \nI think there's two aspects to that. I think some of the decisions can be \nhundreds of thousands of dollars riding on that decision. So sometimes it's \nhard to trust someone else to make that decision on your behalf. Even \nthough there's really no reason why you shouldn't necessarily, it’s just \nthat people like that level of control in their business. But you look at the \ncorporate businesses that can run very efficiently and most of the people \nworking in them don't really have any stake in the game. And yet they're \nmaking much, much bigger decisions. I think that's one element.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 147 \n \nI think the other element is it's very easy to fall into a pattern. For \nexample, when you're working, as opposed to being at a family event, it's \nvery easy to justify that by placing a lot more importance on why you are \nthe only one who could do that task, even if that may not be the reality. \nYou end up feeling probably a little bit more special than what you actually \nare. And when you start breaking that down, it's often not as hard to teach \nsomeone to do the things that you thought only you could do. \nAutomation and the Impact on Workforce \nSince Ash and Bec have taken ownership of Cullingral, the farm has been \ndeveloped such that it is mainly irrigated cotton (as opposed to dryland) and \nuses a centre pivot irrigation system. The system is automated, and other \ntechnologies used on farm include weather stations, moisture probes, diesel level \nsensors and flow meters, and fertigation level sensors. The motivation to adopt \nthe digital technology was to gain more ability to monitor the crop and farm \noperations remotely and to get real time information for decision making and \nthen evaluating the outcomes of these decisions. Ash continues to look at new \noptions and technologies entering the market to expand this. \nWe looked at what was available technology-wise from a remote \nmonitoring point of view and remote starting and stopping things. I \nimplemented that technology so that while you're on a sprayer or a tractor \nyou can be starting and stopping pumps rather than having to stop and \nactually go there and do it. Also, some of the technology is measurement \nrelated so that we can continually monitor, live, exactly how much diesel \nwe're burning while we're irrigating. Which gives you the information to \ntest that if we start managing it differently, for example we switch one \npump off, do our litres per hour or litres per hectare become better or \nworse at any given time. We're continually looking at what can we do \nbetter, what are our major drivers for profitability and how can we \nimprove…what's now available that wasn't available a few years ago at a \nreasonable price point that now it's feasible to implement.  \n \nThe impact of access to labour as a constraint on the crop outcome was also a \nmajor motivator to adopt technology. This shaped perceptions of usefulness as \nthe relative advantage of knowing that the crop would be watered on time versus \nthe risk of relying on manual labour justified the cost to upgrade. \nI didn't want to be in a position where if I couldn't get the two or three \nstaff that I'd need to be out pulling siphons that we wouldn't be able to get \nwater on cotton in the time that it was needed. And when you follow \nthrough the cost of being a day or two late on a watering, it was very, \nvery easy for me to justify the cost to implement the technology that we \nhave to automate a lot of that so I don't have to rely on people to be \ndoing it…. when you see the risk and look at it almost like an insurance \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 148 \n \npolicy, sometimes you're insuring against the cost of not being able to \nachieve something if you don't have it (the technology). \nThe Importance of the Farm Manager and Considering Diversity when Hiring \nEmployees \nThe introduction of digital technologies has meant that labour requirements on \nthe farm have been reduced from approximately 4 or 5 people required \n(including Ash) to now one skilled farm manager to oversee and run the \noperations, supported by contractors for different tasks. With this reduction in \non-farm staff and the transition of Ash to be less hands on, the role of the farm \nmanager, and who is employed in this role, is vital for the success of the farm. \nWith the technology involved this person needs to be “IT savvy” in order to \ntrouble shoot any issues that arise. Ash explained the process for recruiting the \ncurrent staff member into this role, and what was considered at that time. \nI thought I needed somebody with a lot of experience and someone with a \nlot of runs on the board running similar operations to ours. I got a whole \nraft of applicants that were exactly the same as me, they were middle age \nand what they were really looking forward to was the opportunity to spend \na bit more time with their family…I had this one guy who his answer to  \n“what are you looking for?” was, “I'd love to have some more opportunity \nand a chance to prove myself.”  \n \nThe life stage someone is at is an influential factor on their career motivations. \nEven within a small operation the diversity of the team is important in terms of \nconsidering the career stage and aspirations of the team. Ash had already \ndescribed the importance of the next 5 years and the energy he wants to invest \ninto his family and children at critical stages of their development. Hiring \nsomeone who is yet to enter that stage of their life gives him a staff member \nwith a different focus and motivation. This young farm manager had attended ag \ncollege and had been working for a reputable employer but had reached the \nlimits of available  growth for him in this previous job. He did require upskilling \nbut as Ash describes: \n \nIt was relatively easy to upskill someone who was so keen to learn and so \nkeen for extra responsibility. Easier than it would have been, I think, had I \ntaken on someone with all the experience, but a bit less motivation. \n \nThe importance of hiring an engaged and motivated farm manager and the trust \ncreated with that employee, not the remote monitoring technology, is the main \nfactor that assists Ash to be more hands off with the execution of the operations \non farm and in his more strategic role within the business. \n \nI can check the irrigation program is running as per what we planned at \nthe beginning of the week, and it gives you that reassurance but at the \nmoment the thing that gives me the most confidence is the person I've got \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 149 \n \nrunning it….my confidence in their ability and their loyalty and that he's \njust actually keen to make things happen. \n \nPeople Management \nA mixture of formal and informal processes are used to manage and develop the \nworkforce within Ash’s different businesses. \n \nI try to strike a middle ground between what I've seen with how the \ncorporates run their businesses, and a small business where you can be \ncompletely flexible in your (conversations on that) , and I think there's \nsome benefits in both. We have a minimum of one formal performance \nreview a year. And then we would have probably a less formal one every \nthree or four months.  \n \nStaff in both the farming and the engineering business are encouraged to \ndevelop their skills through short courses, field days, and training facilitated by \nmachinery and technology dealerships. This is often targeted around individuals’ \ninterests as well as the business needs.  \n \nWe sit down over a cup of coffee or tea and just identify ways again that \nwe can improve the business and improve personally and any skill \ndeficiencies and any ways that we can look to upskill through training. \n \nThe collaborative approach to identifying skills gaps is important for people to be \nengaged in the training opportunities provided to them. In terms of the value of \ntraining, Ash notes that the return on investment and benefits to the business \nare clear. \n \nWhen we've invested in upskilling our staff, it's always expensive at the \ntime, but in hindsight it's always looked very cheap. \n \nThe risks of hiring a young person who is looking for career growth, is that \neventually the employee may reach a ceiling in terms of the opportunities \navailable within the business. This is managed through open communication \nwhere it is safe for the employee to discuss any potential career frustrations or \nfeelings of stagnation with regards to his job with the grower. By creating this \nkind of dialogue, succession planning for the farm manager’s position can occur \nwith a reasonable transition period for any exiting of the business (if that is the \ncurrent employees’ decision) or with enough planning time, where alternative \nsolutions including expanding the business may also be a feasible option to retain \nthis staff member.  \n \nI'm very conscious of the fact that if I don't keep one step ahead of finding \nnew challenges for him, he will grow stale with the role and want to move \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 150 \n \non to something else. If I was him, I would as well. If we reach that point \nwhere he's conquered every challenge I could possibly find and our \nbusiness is becoming a bit mundane, I support him in moving on to \nsomething bigger and better. The only thing we're really open about is, if \nhe can discuss it with me when he's starting to get these feelings and if he \ncan commit to another 12 months then that will give me time to bring \nsomeone else in under him and myself to train up. So we'll have that \nsuccession. \nThreats and Opportunities \nBusiness Development and Finding the Opportunity Within the Threat \nIn the discussion with Ash, he was forthcoming about the threats he had \nidentified within the business and the consequent opportunities that he has \nactively pursued that were leveraged from engaging with the threat situation. \nThe threats/opportunities discussed below include: (a) the growing presence of \nthe coal seam gas industry in agricultural communities and access to water, and \n(b) community liveability, automation, and access to a skilled workforce. The first \nthreat/opportunity discussed includes transferable lessons in terms of strategic \nmanagement of threats. The second threat/opportunity discussed is a “wicked” \nproblem and will require the co-ordination of multiple stakeholders within and \noutside of agriculture to find a solution. \nCoal Seam Gas Industry, Agriculture, and Access to Water \nThe opportunity for the farm to negotiate an arrangement whereby they can \naccess the treated wastewater from coal seam gas and the negotiation process \ninvolved offers some insights into strategic management of threats and finding \nan opportunity within a potential threat to agriculture. In contrast to the ‘lock the \ngate’ movement, the Basin Sustainability Alliance that Ash was a member of \naimed to find workable solutions and a win-win scenario for two competing \nindustries, agriculture and gas. Other than access to water, Ash has also \ncapitalised on this ‘threat’ by expanding his business interests beyond agriculture \nwith the establishment of an engineering business that works with the coal seam \ngas industry. This diversification of his business interests has been important to \nmitigate the risks associated with sole reliance on a farming when climate factors \nlimit production. \nI think the biggest (development) has been access to the gas industry. At \nthe time, it was seen as such a negative and a potential threat but that \ngave me the opportunity to set up the engineering business and bringing \nin an income stream from an industry that's completely not weather \nrelated… you can't say it's all good but look at it on balance, assess the \nopportunities as well as the threats and the risks and then make a \nbalanced decision based on that…it's been another industry that we've \nbeen able to leverage off. And without that other industry, it's incredibly \nhard. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 151 \n \n \nThe conversion of the farm to irrigation and the access to water from the coal \nseam gas industry has improved the stability of farm production. As a smaller \nfarm, this helps build and maintain relationships with contractors as they can \nusually be assured of some business with the farm season to season regardless \nof drought. These good relationships mean Ash can access the contractors during \nyears of production highs when competition for contractors can be challenging \nfor growers in the region.  \nWhile this has been a win-win scenario for Ash and some growers on the Darling \nDowns, farmers who are only starting negotiations with the Coal Seam Gas \nindustry may not be able to reach the same outcome.  \nAs Ash explains: \nI'd be surprised if it happens again in Queensland because it's been so \nexpensive for these companies to set up their water treatment plants and \nthe ongoing costs. I think they would push back and say, “Well, if you're \ngoing to put those conditions on us, we won't go ahead”…. that's the sort \nof feedback I've gotten from the gas industry. We're pretty lucky that it \nhappened because if they had have known how expensive it was going to \nbe when they went into it, they wouldn't have done it. \nWhat this illustrates is that there may be opportunity within a potential threat if \ncaught early but if left too late this window of opportunity can close. While the \nsituation Ash has experienced may not be replicable, his strategic management \napproach of staying open-minded, setting aside the emotional aspect of the \nissues, being balanced and critically evaluating the evidence in assessing the \nnegatives and looking for potential opportunities, is a process that may be useful \nfor managing future perceived threats to the cotton industry. \nCommunity Liveability, Automation, and Higher Skilled Workforce Requirements \nWhen discussing potential threats to the industry Ash acknowledged that the \nreduction in labour due to automation could impact the critical mass of people \nliving in communities reliant on agriculture for work. This reduction in population \ncould see a reduction in services such as schools or community recreational \nactivities, such as social sports, that help bring people together. This problem is \nnot completely owned by agriculture or the cotton industry, but these industries \nare stakeholders in this issue as it will affect the attraction and retention of \nfuture workforce.  \nThe fabric of our communities is changing and they're not as nice places to \nlive as the populations reduced. I see that as a threat and something that \nwe need to manage. And those two issues (workforce within the local \npopulation and community liveability) actually work very closely together \nin that the less liveable our communities are, the harder it is to attract the \nstaff that aren't currently living there. It's so easy for any one of those \ncommunity stakeholders from individuals to community groups and \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 152 \n \nbusinesses to government, to handball it and say it is a problem, but it's \nnot really our problem. As a result it's just steadily declining and yeah, it's \njust a tough one to manage. \nAs opportunities in agriculture reduce in numbers due to automation, \ncommunities need to diversify the industries that provide work opportunities to \nattract and retain a critical mass of residents. Liveability is not only about \npopulation size but about community health and wellbeing. Changing social \ncultures around alcohol consumption, encouraging physical activity and creating \neffective awareness and supports for mental health were also discussed as \nimportant parts of creating thriving rural communities. The cotton industry is an \nimportant stakeholder that will need to proactively work with communities to \naddress these issues around liveability in the regions. \n \nSummary and conclusion \nThis case study provides an example of relatively smaller cotton growing \nbusiness (compared to cotton farms in earlier case studies) that has undergone \ndigital transformation. The main findings include: \n• Social-emotional skills are important for grower’s leadership capabilities \n• Supportive mentoring through a leadership experience can provide \nvaluable development for growers. \n• Restructuring work roles and learning to delegate ensures job demands \nare sustainable for growers. \n• Automation is valued for precision and reducing the risk that comes with a \nreliance on sourcing workforce to perform manual tasks. \n• Considering the diversity of the workforce in terms of life stage, \nexperience, and motivation is useful for building an effective team \n• People management can be a combination of formal and informal \nprocesses. It is an ongoing conversation, not a tick and flick checklist. \n• Approaching threats looking for opportunities can result in positive \noutcomes for cotton businesses, but the window of time to seize an \nopportunity can be finite. \n• Community liveability is a factor that is indirectly impacted by adoption of \nautomation through the reduction of workforce, and it could negatively \nimpact cotton farming business’ ability to attract the higher skilled \nworkforce required for digital agriculture.  \nPart of the motivation to adopt automation on farm was to better monitor \nresources, improve precision of farm management practices and use objective \ninformation in business decisions. The workforce impacts of these changes has \nbeen that the number of workers employed within the business has reduced, the \nfarm manager must be willing and able to work with these digital systems and \nthe grower has been able to redesign his role to focus more on strategic business \ndevelopment. These changes required the grower to develop their leadership \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 153 \n \ncapabilities, manage and develop their employee to be autonomous, and to \nidentify which tasks could be delegated to others that they would have usually \nperformed in the past. The outcome of these changes are a better work and life \nbalance that reduces the risk of burnout for the grower. Making the time and \nensuring that he has sufficient energy to develop his strategic thinking and \nplanning has meant the grower is well placed to identify and manage threats and \ncapitalise on opportunities that will benefit the business. In this way, he is \nremaining adaptable and willing to make changes for the business to continue to \nsurvive and grow into the future. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 154 \n \nChapter Nine: Discussion \nThe future of work is dynamically shaped by the people of the industry. It is their \npreparedness to grow and change that moves work forward, improves \nproductivity, sustainability, and creates a positive culture within which people \ncan pursue rewarding and meaningful jobs and decent work. Like the National \nAgricultural Workforce Strategy, the current research argues that understanding \nand enabling the adaptability of people, and their willingness and capacity to \nchange the structures and systems they work within, is the mechanism that \nshapes the future of work.  \nThis research has evolved into an investigation of the process of change within \nbusinesses built around multiple visions that are unique to their leader’s \ninterests, strengths, and strategic foresight. Owners, leaders, and proactive \nemployees each find their own ways to grow and shape these businesses. The \ncurrent study provides examples of the different ways change is happening in \ndifferent contexts within the cotton industry and offers some insights for \npotential good practice that may be transferred to other cotton businesses.  \nThe findings from the research are now discussed in relation to the overall aims \nof the research. The implications that come from the evidence are presented, \nlimitations of the research identified, and arguments made for the future \ndirections of research and interventions that focus on getting individuals and \nworkplaces future-ready in the cotton industry. \n \nResearch Aims \nThe aims of the current research included: \n• Understand factors influencing technology acceptance and adoption \n• Understand experiences of transition that occurs with the introduction of \ntechnology \n• Understand entrepreneurial behaviours and the mindsets, skills and \nstructures that encourage entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship within \ncotton businesses \n• Understand the function of the knowledge network and consultants work in \nextension and influencing on-farm change \n• Understand influences on attraction, retention, and development of \nworkforce and how this occurs in adaptable businesses \n• Identify other factors that may shape the future of work and workforce \nrequirements for the Australian cotton industry \nA summary of the findings in response to the research aims are now presented. \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 155 \n \nTechnology Acceptance and Adoption \nThe current research used the technology acceptance model to inform the \nquantitative (grower practices survey) and the qualitative (grower practices \nsurvey and case studies) studies. The overall findings of the research with \nregards to growers’ technology acceptance and adoption are synthesised in \nFigure 9.1. This diagram maps factors that are influential in growers’ movement \nalong the path to adoption of digital technology on farm. \n \n \n \nFigure 9.1 The Digital Technology/Automation adoption continuum for Cotton \nGrowers \nFrom the quantitative analysis (Chapter Two), above and beyond other factors \n(including age, size of broad acre cropping area on farm, and perceived ease of \nuse), growers perceptions that automated technology could (a) be useful in \nsaving them time, (b) reduce labour costs and effort required to manage \nworkers, and (c) be more effective at tasks than current manual approaches, \nwas the main factor that distinguished between growers who had not \nimplemented automation and had no plans when compared to those who are \nconsidering technology solutions for their farms and those who currently use \ntechnology on their farms. Some preliminary evidence also suggested that \ndifferent life stages, as indicated by grower age group, could be related to \nmoving through the adoption journey. Those more likely to be further along this \nadoption journey were younger growers aged 20-34 years old, who are in a \ngrowth stage in their career, and growers aged 45-49 years who may be \nexpected to have teenagers or young adult children and could be in a growth \nstage of their business focused on preparing for the next generation to become \ninvolved. Further research to test these inferences is required. \nThe evidence in the case studies highlights that grower consideration of new \ntechnologies is focused on perceptions of usefulness to solve a production issue \n\n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 156 \n \nthat is a strategic priority and perceptions of relative advantage of the \ntechnology in terms of being more efficient and effective than current \napproaches (Chapter Three, Chapter Four). Growers also reported perceptions \nthat technology could alleviate time pressures and help them to redirect their \nefforts into other aspects of the business (Chapter Two, Chapter Eight), and \nsolve issues with labour, in particular replacing itinerant workers and ensuring \nproduction could quickly increase when access to water was available (Chapter \nFour, Chapter Eight), also contributed to their motivation to increase the use of \nautomated technologies on farm. With regards to these two factors, it is worth \nnoting that not all production issues lend themselves to technological solutions or \nthe technological solutions available may bring their own challenges or a level of \nuncertainty that contributes to why automation may not be considered by some. \nFurthermore, those that are sole operators or have their business set up in a way \nthat makes significant use of contractors may not have the labour challenges \nthat some automation addresses and therefore it is of no interest to them at this \ntime.  \nA dissatisfaction with the status quo (Chapter Three, Chapter Four, Chapter \nEight) and an openness to experience (Chapter Four, Chapter Five) was \nassociated with considering new technology, with some growers who were not \nconsidering technology reportedly happy with their current manual approaches to \ngrowing cotton (Chapter Two). Positioning themselves and their businesses in a \nstage of growth, with the motivation to adapt and improve their farming \nenterprise (Chapter Three, Chapter Four), and their roles within the business \n(Chapter Nine) was also related to grower’s exploration of technology solutions.  \nWhen it comes to making the shift from consideration of digital technology and \nautomation to adoption, an economically sound business case tailored to the \nfarming enterprise is important (Chapter Three, Chapter Four, Chapter Nine). Not \nall technologies will easily integrate with legacy systems whether it is existing \nmachinery/technology or farm management approaches, therefore \nunderstanding the cost/benefit of these within the specific farm context may \nmean the same technology is viable for one grower but not another. Some \ngrowers factor the cost or risk of not adopting technology into the business case \nfor new technology (Chapter Four, Chapter Eight). Growers need to be confident \nin their skills and knowledge with regards to navigating the change process, as \nwell as having the resources available to overcome telecommunications \ninfrastructure issues to proceed with integrating digital technologies into their \nexisting farm management systems (Chapter Two, Chapter Four). Access to \nreliable support from digital technology and automation providers/dealerships, \ntrust that the technology will deliver results, and an actionable plan to ensure \nproduction is not impacted if automation fails also contributed to growers’ \nselection and adoption of digital technology (Chapter Three, Chapter Four). \nThese findings align with concepts identified in the technology acceptance model. \nThe results would seem to demonstrate that moving through the adoption \ncontinuum involves initial perceptions of ease-of-use informed by computer self-\n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 157 \n \nefficacy, digital literacy, and personal interests. This ease-of-use factor then \ninfluences perceptions of usefulness, in that the grower observes that the \ntechnology offers a workable solution to an issue on farm and begins to consider \npotential automated solutions. Then, when examining the business case for new \ntechnology, ease of use in terms of supports, skills to operate and the path to \nimplementation, is again factored in when assessing the relative advantage of \nmaking changes to the system through adoption of automation.  \nThere are implications from these findings for growers and agritech companies. \nFor technology providers, a solid understanding of the production issues that \nmatter to growers and the farming systems that surround these issues is needed \nto find viable solutions. The stronger the value proposition for digital agriculture \nin terms of demonstrable reliability of automation and reduction of capital cost \noutlay, the more growers will consider their solutions. A presence of tailored \nimplementation support and ongoing technical support provided by these \ncompanies will help growers who are considering solutions to adopt. For growers, \nidentifying the longer-term strategic value of digital agriculture solutions, staying \nup to date on opportunities and threats associated with digital agriculture and \nunderstanding how these technologies fit with other trends impacting their \nbusiness is an important part of staying open to considering digital agriculture \nand preparing for when costs reduce, reliability improves and the relative \nadvantage to adopt is apparent. To do this strategic work, growers need to have \nthe resources of time, energy, and capability to focus on the future of their farm, \nworking on their business rather than be consumed by the day-to-day \noperations. Furthermore, training to upskill growers or the cotton workforce in \nthe process of implementation of automated solutions, data collection, data \nmanagement and analysis, and in transformational leadership practices to help \nworkers transition in their roles when technology is introduced, would be \nvaluable to help those interested to move from consideration to adoption.  \nExperiences of Transition Associated with Technology \nCase studies in Chapter three, four, five, and eight offered insights into growers, \nagronomists and on-farm workers’ experiences of transition associated with \ntechnology.  \nGrowers and workers described an orientation to work characterised by an \nopenness to experience, with a curiosity and willingness to challenge the status \nquo. Furthermore, the humility to continue to engage in the learning process \neven when they possess considerable expertise in their roles helped individuals \napproach change rather than avoid it. These qualities were also present in \ndiscussions with growers that are adapting other ways (Chapter Seven) and as \nsuch are not specific to transition associated with technology but transition in \ngeneral. Still, they are highlighted here as important intrapersonal characteristics \nthat underpin the digital transformation of farming businesses. \nTransformational leadership practices were effectively used in a way that helped \nto support workers to adapt within their roles on farm (Chapter Three). Involving \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 158 \n \nworkers in the discussion and investigation of new technology, encouraging them \nto ask questions and to take ownership in developing a specific skillset aligned \nwith their interests encouraged team members to stay engaged and be a part of \nimplementing changes on farm. A thorough understanding of individual \ndifferences, workers strengths and preferences also meant that managers could \ntry and integrate the use of technology in tailored ways to promote use (Chapter \nFour). Additionally, understanding the job demands of workers and making sure \nthe human aspect of work was not lost in the use of technology is essential. \nManaging workers in ways that let them know that they are trusted to do their \njobs and that their contributions are valued while their jobs were changing, and \ndigital technology was increasing the transparency of their actions, is important. \nA perceived loss of trust between the leader and employee, or a diminished \nsense of valued status within the business, and people who otherwise can adapt \nwill become disengaged and resistant to change on farm (Chapter Four). \nEntrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship \nLike the mindset orientations that keep people flexible to transitions on farm, \nentrepreneurship and intrapreneurship is also characterised by openness to \nexperience, curiosity, challenging the status quo, and the humility to keep \nlearning. In addition to this, a mastery goal orientation and a passion to be \ninvolved in creating solutions moves these people beyond adapting to change to \ndriving change within the industry (Chapter Four and Chapter Eight).  Growers \nmay move through phases of entrepreneurial behaviour at times when they can \ninvest the resources (time, energy, and money) that these kinds of activities \nrequire, or they may have designed their roles in the business to be in a position \nwhere their access to resources allow ongoing entrepreneurial behaviour \n(Chapter Three, Chapter Four, and Chapter Eight). \nThe growers who were engaging in entrepreneurial behaviour had the time, \nability, and motivation to think strategically and to look outside the business to \nassess potential threats or problems. Once identified they then looked for \nopportunity within these threats/problems and took action to develop solutions in \nattempts to shape the direction of how these forces may play out and to achieve \nan economically beneficial outcome. On a larger scale this was evident in the \nStatham’s idea formation and pursuit of FibreTrace™(Chapter Four). On a \nsmaller scale this was evident in Ash Geldard’s approach to find a win-win \noutcome from Coal Seam Gas developments in his region (Chapter Eight). Both \nthese examples rely on good business skills and excellent communication skills, \nin particular the ability to communicate with industries outside of agriculture, and \nto collaborate in ways that brings together different expertise to develop a \nsolution.  \nThe agronomists interviewed (Chapter Five) were also entrepreneurial in their \nbusiness, utilising their transferable skills and knowledge to develop multiple \nincome streams . The motivation to do this was to mitigate the risk associated \nwith acting as consultants in an industry where climate variability can severely \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 159 \n \nimpact the supply of steady work. Similarly, in their observations of innovative \ngrowers in their region, they noted that it was those experiencing significant \nconstraints impacting the financial viability of their business that were motivated \nto engage in entrepreneurial behaviour. Those growers that were comfortable \nwith their economic position and satisfied with the current state of their business \nwere less incentivised to explore ways to change it. \nIn terms of intrapreneurial behaviour, this was observed within the Northern \nAustralia Cotton Industry (Chapter Six) and in discussions with the on-farm team \nmembers within Sundown Pastoral Company (Chapter Four). Similar mindsets to \nentrepreneurs are held by people who, while not farm owners, are shaping the \nfuture of the cotton industry from within these businesses. Owners of these \nbusinesses provided structures that allowed this behaviour to flourish including \nsharing knowledge networks, encouraging these workers to build their own \nknowledge networks and to bring new ideas into the business. Intrapreneurs \nrequired the skills to advocate for these ideas and present a business case for \nthe investment of organisational resources. This intrapreneurial behaviour was \nable to thrive as business owners accepted some level of risk/costs associated \nwith short-term failures that may be experienced while ascending the learning \ncurve as part of the pursuit of innovation.  \nKnowledge Networks and the Role of Consultants \nThe networks that people have formed in the cotton industry and outside of the \ncotton industry were influential sources of information and collaboration that \ninfluenced business and personal development activities on farm, and this was \nevident across all case studies. Social based learning was an influence on the \nconsideration of digital technology. Farmers who were early adopters shared the \npractical experience of making changes to their farming systems and could \ndiscuss the benefits and challenges of doing so with their networks which allowed \nothers to make informed adoption decisions. Growers collaborated with \nconsultants and researchers to conduct trials, opening their farms to host field \ndays (Chapter Three, Chapter Four, Chapter Eight), collaborated on bench \nmarking their businesses or sourcing training and upskilling together (Chapter \nSeven), or organised with others to take collective action to tackle external \nthreats (Chapter Eight).  \nWhen networks and collaboration are influential to how growers shape their \nbusinesses, it means the strength and amount of diverse expertise of the \nnetwork that growers are connected to is influential on innovation. But the more \ndiversity in the network, the more skilful people need to be in communication \nand working to understand positions that may be different to their own. Growers’ \nabilities to cultivate these relationships, engage with others with different \nperspectives or expertise, and to find places of convergence and common ground \ninform their adaptability within themselves, their businesses and ultimately the \nadaptability of the industry as whole. Similarly, the diverse perspectives and \nexpertise that growers, on-farm workforce, and agronomists possess, is a \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 160 \n \nvaluable resource that can provide an essential contribution to strengthen the \nefforts of researchers, and machinery and technology developers to find better \nworkable solutions for industry challenges. The knowledge network needs to flow \nin both directions between participants in the innovation system. Connectedness \nand collaboration are vital to the future of work for all players in the cotton \nindustry. \nThe agronomists who were interviewed had identified the value that could be \nrealised if their networks of growers were better able to collaborate with people \nthat they may not have previously formed a connection with, finding new ideas \nand support in sharing their experiences. This insight was the impetus for the ag-\ntech startup Yacker, a secure platform that encourages discussion to occur either \nonline or directly connecting to each other via a phone call. This innovation \nintroduces a new way for people in the industry to broaden their networks \nbeyond their own social groups and makes knowledge more accessible for newer \nentrants who may not possess the social capital to gain the breadth of insights \nthat are easily accessible for those who are more connected through \nlongstanding ties with the industry. Working towards equitable access to the \nknowledge network is important to increase the diversity of talent that can be \nattracted, developed, and retained within the industry.  \nDevelopment and Retention \nThis discussion chapter deliberately focuses on the development and retention of \npeople to work in the cotton industry before discussing attraction. Workplaces \nthat effectively retain staff have the structures and conditions that create an \nauthentic attraction proposition for new employees. Each employer that \nparticipated in the case study research noted the importance of staff retention to \nthe continual development of their business. Cotton growers understand the \nimpact their workforce has within their business and highly value staff, wanting \ntheir employees to feel committed to and a part of the business (Chapter Two). \nRetention is a priority as organizational knowledge, (e.g. knowledge of the farm \nenvironment, knowledge of work standards, knowledge of roles within the team) \ntakes time to develop and leads to efficiency gains.  \nThe topic of development and retention is also considered at the grower/business \nowner level. Growers committed to their own personal development and open to \nnew ideas for their businesses will adapt to survive and thrive into the future. \nFarms are complex businesses, and the people who work within them can be at \nrisk of having placed an unsustainable number of demands on themselves within \ntheir role at work. A socially sustainable business will structure work and design \nroles in a way that allows leaders to balance their time to work strategically on \nthe business and overseeing work in the business. Preventing work-related \nburnout by ensuring job demands are balanced with adequate resources is \nimportant for growers to persist in their own agricultural careers. Succession of \nroles within the business whether for family members or employees will be \nproactively discussed, planned and regularly reviewed.  \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 161 \n \nTo ensure their workload was sustainable, several growers had deliberately \nworked on developing their ability to delegate. This skill and approach to \nmanagement was successful in large (Chapter Four), medium (Chapter Three), \nand smaller (Chapter Eight) enterprises. Encouraging and assisting an individual \nworker to develop expertise in one or more aspects of the farm management \nsystem empowered these workers to take ownership in their role (Chapter Three, \nChapter, Four, Chapter Eight). This could also reduce the demands on the \ngrower/farm manager to be the main source of upskilling or support for workers \nto learn on-the-job. These leaders could behave as a connector manager by \nensuring team members knew each other’s strengths to effectively support each \nother’s learning, and how to access outside expertise to help them in their job \nperformance. Extending connections within the knowledge network as a way to \ndevelop employee’s skills and competence, encourages autonomous behaviour, \ncollaboration at work and facilitates a culture of improvement.  \nDeveloping staff through good people management practices leads to greater \nemployer satisfaction with their workforce (Chapter Two). Creating an \nenvironment where workers can contribute ideas and speak openly about issues \nat work, and can expect to receive tailored guidance, support, and feedback on \ntheir performance, contributes to their ability to adapt to changes and to work \nautonomously on farm (Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four). These \nmanagement practices are consistent with some of the characteristics of \ntransformational leadership. When skilfully employed by those in supervisory or \nleadership roles, these management practices contribute to a psychologically \nsafe culture. The impacts of this are that workers are (a) more engaged in the \nlearning process, (b) more accepting of implementation of new technology or \nnew approaches to the way they perform their tasks, (c) dedicated in the effort \nthey apply at work, and (c) committed to working for their current employer \n(Chapter Three, Chapter Four). \nThere are many reasons why staff may not be retained in cotton farm \nbusinesses. Some include reduced availability of work due to drought, or staff \nmay reach a point in their career where they have exhausted the development \nopportunities available to them and leave to seek new challenges. The \nbusinesses studied within the current research were attempting to improve \nretention and considering the ways that farm productivity solutions may \ncontribute to both issues. Implementation of automation and expansion of \nbusinesses across regions with different climatic conditions were two strategies \nused that could contribute to feasibly retaining a core group of skilled workers. \nThis group of workers could hold the organizational knowledge required to \nrapidly increase production when water became available and contribute to \ngrowing the business. Automation was reducing reliance on seasonal workers \nand increasing the skill level required of the smaller workforce (Chapter Three, \nChapter Four, Chapter Eight). Seasonal or unskilled workers often seek work on \nfarms motivated by extrinsic needs (e.g. money or to satisfy a visa requirement), \nas opposed to intrinsic needs (e.g. with a genuine interest in farming and \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 162 \n \nwanting to develop and achieve personal goals through this work). By removing \nmore itinerant workers from the business through increasing automation of \nmanual labour tasks, the expected benefits to those on-farm was an improved \nworkplace culture. It was proposed that a greater proportion of workforce that \nare unified by shared values, in terms of enjoying the lifestyle of farming and a \ncommitment to their work, would lead to a more enjoyable and satisfying \nworkplace (Chapter Four).  \nWhile many of the people interviewed were optimistic about the impacts of \nautomation, there were some concerns raised that need to be proactively \naddressed. In regions where agriculture was the main employer, a reduction in \npopulation as a result of automation replacing jobs could impact the quality of \nlife within the local community. This may negatively impact retention and \nattraction of the in-demand higher skilled workers required to work with digital \nfarming systems. The shifting demographics in farm businesses due to \nautomation will require rural communities to diversify the industries which \neconomically sustain their regions. This is necessary in order to maintain a \ncritical mass of people to support the provision of essential services (e.g. health, \neducation) and social activities that contribute to a sense of belonging. The \nlifestyle that comes with working in these communities is important to retain \nworkers. \nAnother concern is that in the past, agriculture has been an industry that offers \npeople who may have low literacy levels the opportunity to develop a rewarding \ncareer. These workers could thrive as their dedication and ability to work with \ntheir hands or be mechanically-minded has been an asset to farms regardless of \ntheir reading ability. A greater reliance on digital technology and the information \nthat it provides does require a literacy level that may be beyond some of these \nworkers. Older workers with declining vision may struggle to use screens that \nuse smaller fonts. If ag-tech can be designed to support the diverse abilities of \npeople who are attracted to farming then perhaps the industry can still draw on \nthis group of workers that have the attitude and motivation to do good work that \nbenefits cotton farming businesses. \nAttraction \nEmployers interviewed noted the potential challenges with attracting a \nmotivated, skilled next generation worker into the cotton industry. Two of the \nbusinesses studied were either invested in or considering partnerships with \neducational institutions at the tertiary and secondary school level. They argued \nthat this would help to build a pipeline of talent supported into the cotton \nindustry (Chapter Four, Chapter Seven). These business owners paid particular \ninterest to involvement with schools/colleges with whom they had pre-existing \nrelationships. There is a good argument for focusing on these institutions as the \nvalues fostered with students through their educational experience likely reflect \nvalues that resonate with these business owners. Values congruence aids \ntransition between study and employment in a way that is beneficial for both the \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 163 \n \nemployer and employee and easy transition is important in businesses where \nleaders are time poor.  \nHowever, if the future of work, as discussed in the interviews, will involve a \nhigher level of proficiency of digital skills, soft skills, and technical skills, then it is \nexpected the cotton industry will be competing with other agriculture industries \nfor talent, as well as industries outside of agriculture. Expanding these school-\nindustry partnerships beyond business owners’ pre-existing relationships may \nhelp to access a more diverse talent pool. Growers/business owners and \nschools/students that are unfamiliar with each other require support to organize \nor establish these sorts of partnerships. A successful example of this, discussed \nby one farm manager in the research (Chapter Four), was the Cotton Australia \nGap Year program that saw a student from Canberra with no connection to the \nindustry complete a successful placement on a farm. This led to his enrolment in \ntertiary study and completion of further work experiences within the cotton \nindustry. External support was provided in the form or organizing the application \nprocess and compliance-based training for school leavers, as well as connecting \nthese young people to form a peer network of “Gappies”.   \nAttraction issues were noted with the expansion of cotton to Northern Australia, \nwhere farms are remote and local workforce are not skilled in cotton production. \nWorkers are sometimes hesitant to move to unfamiliar environments, although \nthe different seasonal peaks of Northern cotton compared to Southern cotton \nmay offer an opportunity for new entrants to the industry to explore work in \ndifferent locations. A graduate program could rotate students through different \ncotton production valleys to gain experience in different environments and \ndifferent cotton production farming systems. If seeking to encourage these \ngraduates to choose jobs in unfamiliar locations, it is important that they are \nsupported to build social relationships and ties to the community. Work and \npersonal lives are intertwined and satisfaction in both domains is required to \nremain in a business and in a community. A culture of inclusion that fosters a \nsense of belonging helps new entrants to build relationships and encourages the \ndevelopment of a professional identity associated with being a part of the cotton \nindustry.  \nAcross cotton production areas, mining was a continued competitor for workers \nthat hold similar interests (working in practical ways, with machinery) to those \nthat work on farm. However, growers and workers noted the benefits of the \nlifestyle (in terms of the environmental conditions) that work on a farm could \noffer that mining could not (Chapter Three, Chapter Six). These workers could \nbetter combine their work and home life and work in environments that gave \neasy access to appealing recreational activities. Highlighting this lifestyle factor \nmakes for a distinct value proposition that could attract people away from \nmining. However, presently the digital technology used in mining is far more \nwidespread than that used on farms. When it comes to the next generation, who \nhave led lives where digital technology has had a greater presence than previous \ngeneration, jobs that use cutting edge technology may capture their interest \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 164 \n \nwhen selecting a career path (Chapter Four). The importance of having these \ntypes of tools on farm could help to demonstrate the dynamic and progressive \nnature of cotton farming and attract talented young people to the industry. \nFurthermore, the adequate telecommunications connectivity that is required to \nimplement digital technology on farm, is considered an essential service by many \npeople that is used to facilitate the increasingly digitally connected lives that they \nlead. To not have internet access where one lives and works is to deprive people \nof a service that is readily offered in many other industries. Young people expect \nto stay connected to information, entertainment, and their social networks \nthrough internet access. Unreliable access to the internet could be a factor that \nnegatively impacts job and career choices (Chapter Four). \nOther Factors of Interest \nThere were other factors of interest identified within the research that may \nimpact the changing skillsets required for the future workforce and strategic \ndirections of businesses. These were (a) data collection, management, and use, \n(b) transparency, and (c) social licence. \nThe rise of digital technology makes it possible to collect extensive amounts of \ndata on farm resources, management practices, and outcomes achieved. This is \ncreating the potential for a role dedicated to data management on farm. At the \nmoment, the economic returns for paying someone to fill this role were not \nevident. The value of data has often been discussed with regards to improved, \nobjective decision making on farm. Yet, some participants in the current research \nfelt there was little relative advantage when considering the time imposition and \neffort required to integrate the task of extensive data collection, management, \nand use on farm when compared to current knowledge and practices.   \nHowever, the value of data is also in the validation of good management \npractice. This is of interest to sectors of society who want greater transparency \nof the environmental impacts of cotton production. There is recent interest in the \npotential to diversify grower’s income through programs that pay for measurable \nimprovements in biodiversity or carbon gains. While schemes such as the \nAustralian Farm Biodiversity Stewardship Pilot are in trial stages, on Keytah (as \ndiscussed in Chapter Four), the Statham’s collection of data allowed for an \nindependent audit to verify the carbon footprint of their farm management \npractices. This is being used to substantiate the environmental claims of their \npremium brand Good Earth Cotton™. Data collection, management, and use \nskills are vital to create and demonstrate the value of this brand. \nGreater transparency of the industry is something cotton growers who are \nengaging in best practice can confidently provide. But to ensure this brings \nbenefits, skilled communication needs to accompany this transparency. \nDiscussing the amount of water used per bale of cotton means nothing to people \nwithout a frame of reference to comprehend this information. Skilled \ncommunication is particularly needed in areas such as the Northern Territory  or \nWestern Australia, where those unfamiliar with cotton growers may be concerned \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 165 \n \nabout the introduction of this crop to areas that are being developed for broad \nacre farming. The skills to build relationships with diverse stakeholders is \nessential to generating trust for the farm management standards that are \naccepted and maintained by people in the industry. The combination of data to \nvalidate claims, good communicators, and transparency are central to the social \nlicence and future of the cotton industry and the people who work within it.  \nLimitations of the Research \nThere are a number of limitations of the present research project. This includes \nthe potential for ‘survivor bias’ in the findings of the research. By only studying \nbusinesses that possess examples of successful adaptability, the research may \noverlook significant barriers to successful adaptation of businesses that need to \nbe addressed to support transitions associated with the future of work. The \nsurvivor bias of the research may also inflate the attributed impact that factors of \ninterest identified in the research have on the success of the businesses studied. \nFurthermore, the cotton industry consists of an incredibly diverse array of \nfarming businesses. With the limited number of case studies conducted, it is \nunlikely that saturation has been achieved with regards to comprehensively \nidentifying all future of work and adaptability factors. However, some factors, \nincluding the personality factors of openness to experience and humility, and an \norientation of continuous learning were repeatedly observed across different \nbusinesses. \nThe strengths-based approach (studying successful cotton farming enterprises) \nthat could contribute to survivor bias in the findings of the research was used for \npragmatic reasons. The Australian cotton industry is a small industry. The \ninformation required to describe the participating businesses in sufficient detail to \nallow readers to assess the relevancy of the findings for their owns contexts \nmeant even if names of people or places were removed, it is likely the \nparticipants would have been identifiable by those within the industry. \nConfidentiality could not be assured and ethically it was important that no \ninformation shared would be harmful to participants and their reputations. This \nmakes it not practical to study cotton businesses that may be struggling to adapt \nto the changing future of work context using the case study method that has \nbeen employed for this research. Future research that allows the anonymous \nparticipation of employers and employees to discuss issues relating to attraction, \ndevelopment, management, and retention to the cotton industry would be \nvaluable. \nFuture Directions for Research \nThe current research found that a learning culture within businesses was \nunderpinned by a psychologically safe environment. Psychological safety is \ndefined as the belief that individuals can engage in interpersonal risk-taking at \nwork without negative consequences such as ridicule or rejection (Edmonson, \n1999). This factor is associated with improved team learning and performance, \nand wellbeing in the workplace. Past research has focused on high-risk contexts \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 166 \n \nsuch as healthcare where failure by medical professionals to speak up or a fear \nof asking questions could lead to mistakes that have fatal consequences for \npatients. To date no research in the Australian agricultural context has explored \nthis construct in relation to on-the-job training and the workplace learning \nenvironment.  \nThe literature would suggest psychological safety to be an important focus for \ndeveloping capable coaches and managers in the workplace, but how this \nconcept works in the farming context needs to be tested before being built into \nany recommendations or resources for extension. Research is required to \nunderstand how psychological safety needs to be framed for growers to adopt \nthese practices, the language that needs to be used, and whether there are any \nnegatives associated with this construct in the farming context. For example, \nwould feeling safe to take interpersonal risks on farm be beneficial for emotional \nwellbeing (confidence to speak up about issues or mistakes) but create an \nenvironment where the team, free from judgement from each other, may feel \nsafe to engage in unethical behaviour? \nGiven the past research on psychological safety, learning more about the factors \nthat lead to a psychologically safe work environment and understanding ways to \nimprove this, could illuminate what may be a lynch pin to achieving a more \nsocially sustainable work environment in terms of learning and wellbeing. This \nwould be a valuable contribution, generating new knowledge that would place \nthe industry at the cutting edge of positive workplace culture and sustainability \nat work. \nFuture Directions for Development and Extension of the Research \nThe future of work is frequently described as volatile, uncertain, complex and \nambiguous and requires a capable workforce to embrace the changes required to \nadapt to new developments on farm. Best practice people management requires \ngrowers to be skilled at leading workers through change processes and to \nempower employees to take greater responsibility for developing their soft skills \nto maintain their employability and adaptability. This is central to social \nsustainability and the ‘People’ pillar of the cotton industry sustainability \nframework. \n \nAt the moment, current HR&WHS myBMP modules are very much focused on the \nregulatory compliance aspects of workforce management (minimum acceptable \nstandards). Other areas of myBMP which clearly identify best practice in the \ntechnical aspects of farm management and offer growers access to resources \nthat extend  their research investment and contribute to environmental \nsustainability standards of the industry. The current HR & WHS myBMP system \ndoes not do this in a similar way that ensures it contributes to social \nsustainability standards. For example, in the current iteration of myBMP, a \nchecklist item that could allude to best practice is ‘A performance management \nprocess is in place’ - this is supported by a best practice resource that comes \nfrom Dairy Australia. More can be done to give cotton growers an industry \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 167 \n \nrelevant framework and example actions/performance standards for best practice \nof leading people through a change process and managing/developing workforce. \nIt is proposed that extension activities from the current research should attempt \nto integrate best practice transformational and entrepreneurial leadership, people \nmanagement, and individual development into cotton industry businesses. \nFurther investigation into the development and testing of a pilot program that \nidentifies pathways to delivery and industry-relevant content/activities that \ncreate practice change is required. \nConclusion \nWhile the future of work is never certain, several trends are shaping changes in \nthe way people work in the cotton industry including the rise in digital \ntechnologies, environmental constraints, and shifting societal demands. An ability \nto adapt, respond, and capitalise on these trends will determine the ongoing \nsurvival of the cotton industry. Like the National Agriculture Workforce Strategy, \nthe current research found that it is the ‘human’ aspect of cotton businesses that \nwill be a major factor in determining whether the industry is disrupted by the \nchanging economic, environmental, or social landscape or whether it can position \nitself to be a beneficiary of new developments and thrive into the future. \nIn the current research different cotton growing enterprises formed the basis of \nsix case studies that explored the personalities, traits, abilities, skills and \nstructures that enabled people in the cotton industry to approach and embrace \npositive changes that improved the economic, environmental, and social \nsustainability of their work. The cotton industry values continuous improvement \nand within these case studies the actions that align with these values were \nidentified. Continuous improvement means continuous learning and then \npersisting in applying new learning to drive strategic change in workplaces. \nManaging this change requires great leadership, management and a willingness \nand ability of the workforce to remain adaptive. Creating the supportive \nworkplaces that enable these adaptive orientations and behaviours is essential to \nestablish the cotton industry as the employer of choice to attract and retain the \ntalented workforce that is required for the future of work. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUniversity of Southern Queensland | Contextualising the Future of Work in the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 168 \n \n \nReferences \n \nAzarias, J, Nettle, R & Williams, J.

In particular, this project collaborated with Australian cotton farmers and \nconsultants to explore values and attitudes about biodiversity practices, and what factors might motivate or \nconstrain adoption of new practices (or strengthening existing practices). We conducted online surveys \nand interactive workshops with cotton growers and other members of the cotton industry.  \nPERSPECTIVES ON BIODIVERSITY \nThere was general support for initiatives to tackle biodiversity loss, but agreement was not universal \nOverall, the majority of participants agree that biodiversity loss is a serious issue in Australia, that it is an \nimportant issue for the cotton industry to address. However, this perception is not universal, with some \nparticipants not agreeing with statements about this issue. Although most participants within the \nworkshops expressed support for industry initiatives in this area, it is important to recognise that initiatives \nmay be needed to broaden this support across the industry.  \nClear goals and support are vital for moving forward \nThere were differences in understanding about what the term biodiversity referred to. Uncertainty about \nthe term biodiversity and its relevance to farming practices could limit grower engagement in industry \nprograms. Initiatives to tackle biodiversity need to have clear definition and goals. Most participants \ndescribed that growers ‘want to do \nthe right thing’, but a range of \nstrategies will need to be deployed \nto generate widespread adoption. \nGENERAL STRATEGIES \nTO SUPPORT \nADOPTION  \nDiscussions revealed a range of \nstrategies that were perceived to \nsupport adoption of these \npractices.   \n\n \n5 \n \nPERSPECTIVES ON KEY PRACTICES  \nResults did not reveal a ‘favourite’ practice to consider for prioritising in biodiversity management targets. \nParticipants considered management of feral animals to have a strong advantage (relative to costs) and \nwas considered highly compatible with farming practices. However, participants described a range of \nopportunities and challenges for each of the four practices.  We provide a range of criteria to consider \nbehavioural prioritisation.  \n \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApproach & Scope \n \n \nRATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT \nThe Cotton Research and Development Corporation sought to better understand grower and industry \nperceptions about strategies to improve on-farm impacts related to biodiversity. In particular, this project \ncollaborated with Australian cotton farmers and consultants to explore values and attitudes about \nbiodiversity practices, and what factors might motivate or constrain adoption of new practices (or \nstrengthening existing practices).  \nPRACTICES TARGETS FOR RESEARCH \nThe Cotton Research and Development Corporation identified four practices for focusing social research.  \nThese were  \n- Strengthening targeted revegetation and regeneration  \n- Improving stock exclusion from rivers, streams and wetlands \n- Strengthening control of environmental weeds \n- Strengthening control of feral animals \nThis project recognised that many cotton growers have some existing engagement in these practices.  \nBecause the focus of the project was related to change—specifically, improving outcomes related to \nbiodiversity—this project designed questions that related to strengthening these practices, rather than \nmaintaining existing practices.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nMETHODOLOGICAL APPROACH \nThis project had two components \n1. A quantitative online survey was developed to explore existing engagement in biodiversity \nmanagement practices, and factors that may influence adoption. \n2. A series of small focus groups with growers and consultants enabled rich discussion about the \nopportunities and challenges growers face when considering biodiversity management practices.  \nThese were both conducted between June and September 2021.  \nOnline survey \nTwenty-seven individuals completed the online survey: 16 were cotton growers, and 7 were consultants. \nThe remaining respondents had other roles such as farm managers or worked in the extension industry. A \nrange of regions were represented by survey respondents: while most were from northern NSW (21 / 78%) \nother regions represented included central QLD, Darling Downs, and Macintyre / Balonne.  Respondents \nwere involved in diverse types of farms: the most frequent type was mixed cropping (74%), following by \nirrigated and dryland cropping (56%), grazing (56%), and irrigated cotton (44%).  \nFocus group discussions and workshops \n27 individuals participated in focus-group style workshop discussions. Regions represented included \nEmerald, Gwydir, Dalby, Macquarie, South NSW, Namoi and Goondiwindi.  Twenty-one participants \nwere cotton growers, four were consultants, and others were industry representatives.  \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \nIn addition to exploring perceptions of growers about individual practices, we also apply a framework to \nexplore elements of practices that may influence adoption of innovations—which in this case are \nbiodiversity management practices.  Specifically, we apply a framework from Diffusion of Innovations \ntheory.  Within this framework, practices are more likely to be adopted if  \n• The advantages of practices are perceived to outweigh the disadvantages,  \n• The practice is compatible with existing on farm issues, lifestyle, and values \n• The benefits of the practice are observable to growers and to others \n• The practice is easy to understand and adopt \n• The practice can be trialled in some way (e.g. for a period of time, or on a smaller parcel of \nland) prior to making a larger commitment   \nETHICS CLEARANCE \nThis project was conducted in accordance with the Australian National Statement on Ethical \nConduct in Human Research (Ethical clearance #5025, Queensland University of Technology) \n  \n \n8 \n \n \n \nFindings from online survey \n \n \nPERCEPTIONS ABOUT BIODIVERSITY AND BIODIVERSITY \nMANAGEMENT \nIssue agreement \nMore than half of respondents to the online survey agreed that biodiversity loss was a serious issue in \nAustralia (62.5% scoring more than 50 on a 1-100 scale, mean=64, Range 32-100).  Similarly, just over \ntwo thirds agree that loss of biodiversity on cotton farms would have a strong impact on the Australian \ncotton industry (73.9% scoring over 50, mean=60, range 7-100). Most participants agreed (79%) that it \nwas important for people in their position to do what they can to protect biodiversity.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAlignment between protecting biodiversity and contribution to the industry   \nRespondents were asked to indicate to what extent strengthening action to protect biodiversity would \ncontribute to aspects of the Australian cotton industry. Most respondents indicated that biodiversity \nmanagement would support integrated pest management (87%), support a ‘clean, green’ image for the \nindustry (83%), and support a community licence to operate (79%).  \n \nCurrent understanding about threats to biodiversity and strategies to mitigate \nthese threats \nMost respondents in the online survey indicated at least some understanding of threats to biodiversity \n(70.8%), how their practices influence biodiversity (73.9%) and strategies to protect biodiversity (78.3%). \nHowever, only a minority of respondents (1-2 respondents, 4-8%) described a strong understanding of \nthese issues.  \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nOther perceptions that could influence adoption \nBecause many cotton growers may already implement certain practices on farm to protect biodiversity, we \nexamined whether this existing engagement may pose a barrier to strengthening these practices via new \ninitiatives.  Most respondents (79%) agreed with the statement that cotton growers are not being sufficient \nacknowledged for existing practices.  This suggests that any new initiative would benefit from \nincorporating a component to communicate and share narratives of success with regard to strengthening \nexisting practices or adoption of new practices.  \nNonetheless, only one third (33%) indicated that they already do enough for biodiversity and don’t need to \ndo more, and only 12% indicated that that don’t need to take action because it’s the responsibility of \nothers.  \n \nEXISTING ENGAGEMENT IN SPECIFIC PRACTICES \nRespondents were asked whether they already engaged in each of the four practices.  The practice with the \nstrongest existing uptake was feral management, with all respondents indicating that they had engaged in \nsome form of management of feral animals. The other practice with strong rates of existing engagement \nwas weed management, with only 5% of respondents indicating that they had not engaged in weed \nmanagement practices.  The practice with the lowest rate of existing uptake was revegetation and \nregeneration practices: 32% indicated existing engagement, 32% reported ‘a little’ engagement, while \n37% reported no engagement in revegetation or regeneration practices.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADVANTAGES OF DIFFERENT PRACTICES AND COMPATIBILITY \nParticipants were asked to rate how they perceived the relative advantage of each practice, and how \ncompatible it was with farming practices. Feral animal control exhibited the highest relative advantage, \nand the highest compatibility with existing farm practices. In contrast, revegetation had the lowest scores \nfor relative advantage and compatibility.  \n \n  \nInsights for practice change – ‘go for gold’ \nThe biggest opportunity for change sits with the \npractices that have the lowest rates of existing \nuptake.  \nBased on the online survey results, initiatives \nthat focus on promoting revegetation could \nelicit greater impact than initiatives that \npromote feral management.  \nHowever, it is important to consider why this \npractice may have lower rates of uptake, and \nensure initiatives are able to address barriers. \n \nOrange area \nrepresents \nopportunity for \nimpact \n\n \n12 \n \nParticipants were provided with the option to add additional information about the benefits and \nbarriers to adopting each practice (full responses in Appendix A) \nFor revegetation practices, the described benefits related to \ndirect enhancement of biodiversity across the farm through \nproviding habitat and wildlife corridors, improving the social \nimage of cotton farming, increasing productivity, and \nassisting with carbon capture.  \nChallenges related to financial cost, time and effort, \navailability of land, and ensuring revegetation is linked to \ncorridors and sources appropriate plant species. \n \n \nThe benefits of stock exclusion from waterways and riparian \nareas involved both benefits to biodiversity generally, and a \nrange of indicators of waterway health, such as reducing erosion, \nstablising riverbanks, and improving water quality.  \nChallenges related to the costs and labour involved in fencing \nand fence maintenance, the impact of flood damage, lack of \naccess to water, and impact on pest species.  \nBenefits of strengthening weed management practices were diverse. \nResponses included increased productivity and positive impacts on \ncash crops, reduced weed seedbank, and return of native grasses.  \nChallenges of strengthening weed management practices the high \nfinancial cost of controlling some weeds, especially chemical costs, \nminimising negative impacts on non-weed species, access to certain \nareas, herbicide resistance, the availability of ‘softer’ options \nincluding non-chemical control, and lack of understanding about the \neconomic benefits of effective weed control.   \n \n The benefits of strengthening control of feral animals included \nbenefits for farm productivity and biodiversity. For example, cited \nfarming benefits included reducing crop damage and negative impacts \non crop yield, improved biosecurity, and productivity. Benefits to \nbiodiversity included greater abundance of bird and mammal species,  \nRespondents highlighted the importance of everyone contributing to \nferal animal control. Challenges to strengthening feral animal control \nincluded limited effectiveness without area-wide management, \nfinanical costs and labour, limited effective control methods for some \nspecies, managing public image, and safety. \n \nThese findings suggest that management of feral animals and weed management are perceived to have \nstrong advantages, and compatible with other farming practices.  However, based on the description of \nbenefits, there is not a clear link to biodiversity benefits, especially compared to revegetation practices. \nThis suggest that if these ‘standard practices’ are targeted/prioritised for biodiversity management, then \n\n \n13 \n \nadditional communication would need to emphasise that additional benefits for biodiversity of these \npractices.  If delivering biodiversity benefits required some change in these practices, a dependence on \nstatus quo may create a barrier to change.  \nATTRIBUTES OF PRACTICES THAT INFLUENCE ADOPTION \nParticipants were provided with a series of statements and asked to rate them for each practice (see Figure \nbelow). Overall, respondents agreed with statements that these practices are positive things to do, are \nhelpful for biodiversity, and that other farmers would approve of these practices. In addition, respondents \nlargely agreed with statement about having the capacity to engage in each practice, and that the benefits \nare observable.   \nOverall, responses for each of the four practices were similar, with a few exceptions. While revegetation \nand stock exclusion practices had the strongest ratings of being helpful for biodiversity, these two \npractices had less positive responses for a number of items.  Specifically, there was overall disagreement \nwith the statement that ‘cotton industry groups agree that cotton farmers should adopt this practice”.  This \nsuggests that the current social norms for these practices are not positive. Any targeting of these practices \nfor industry-wide adoption would need to be accompanied by communication content designed to \nstrengthen social norms – for example, emphasising wide-spread industry support for these practices, and \nsharing positive stories about growers who have engaged in these practices.  \nIn addition, responses indicated that revegetation and stock exclusion are viewed as more challenging for \ngrowers, and less aligned with other farm priorities.  This suggests that any prioritisation of these practices \nwould need to ensure synergies between biodiversity practices and other farm activities were identified \nand promoted, and that barriers to engaging in targeted practices were identified and addressed \nproactively.   \n  \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nFindings from workshops \n \n \nHOW DOES THE TERM ‘BIODIVERSITY’ RESONATE WITH GROWERS \nThe term ‘biodiversity’ is not immediately meaningful  \nA number of discussions revealed that the term ‘biodiversity’ is not immediately clear to many growers. \nFor some, it was a general term encompassing all of the natural environment. For example, as stated by \none grower, biodiversity reflects both landscape features such as rivers, wetlands and pasture, as well as \ngrasses and trees:  \n[biodiversity is] all of the environment that you've got around you… [the] river , \nwetlands…  pasture, native grasses, trees…” \nFor others, it reflected not just the abundance of plants and animals, but how they interacted with each \nother.  Some respondents emphasised the need to consider not just the larger components (such as trees or \nlarger wildlife), but also small species and insects.  \nAnother issue that emerged within these discussions was whether biodiversity should only be considered \nin non-cropping areas (with native vegetation and wildlife), or whether diversity of invertebrates and soil \nmicrobes in cropping areas was also an important component of biodiversity. For example, one participant \nhighlighted that when considering biodiversity, they view microorganisms in the soil that support healthy \nsoils and healthy crops as part of on-farm biodiversity:   \n“…for me, we most definitely have two separate areas [of biodiversity], we've got \nour natural veg biodiversity and we've got our farming country—productive \neconomic biodiversity. We need both” \nClear definitions and goals are vital for moving forward \nMost participants were interested in understanding how biodiversity linked to their farming practices, but \nthe lack of clarity about the definition of biodiversity made this difficult.  For many participants the \n‘vagueness’ of the term meant it was difficult to really think about in a specific way. For example, one \nparticipant felt that it was jargon, or a ‘buzzword’ and wanted more detail on what the focus actually was:  \n“…[I see biodiversity as]a bit of a buzzword, like sustainability … what biodiversity  \nThe lack of clarity about the term biodiversity flowed over into uncertainty about how biodiversity and \nsuccess of biodiversity initiatives would be measured and assessed.  Most respondents indicated that they \nwould not know how to assess biodiversity on their property.  As said stated by one participant:  \n“If I went in and tried to map my biodiversity, I wouldn't know where to start” \n \n \n15 \n \nMany participants felt that—for the CRDC to move forward on this issue—there needed to be clear \ndefinition that resonated with cotton growers. One participant highlighted that they felt the issue of \nbiodiversity management was currently ‘asleep’ for the cotton industry, and that they needed a clear \ncharter, and clear goals about what needed to be achieved. For example, one participant said:   \n“ [I] think CRDC need to be pretty clear as to what biodiversity… encompasses” \nParticipants identified a need to know many parts of this issue, including whether the focus would be on \nnative vegetation, wildlife, or smaller species, and whether it involved maintaining existing biodiversity, \nor supporting increasing biodiversity.  \n“…are CRDC looking to increase biodiversity on cotton farm? Or are they looking \nto promote the [areas] where it already is?” \nThere is strong support for industry leadership on biodiversity management \nOverall, participants indicated strong support for the cotton industry taking a leadership role in the area of \nbiodiversity management, and viewed biodiversity as an important opportunity to ‘do the right thing’ and \nbuild social licence for the industry. One participant described how building a social licence via activities \nsuch as biodiversity management would generate long term benefits for the industry:  \n“I agree, it’s all about social licence. I think long term benefits will come from \nbiodiversity enhancement.” \nOne participant described how engaging in these types of issues could be vital for the future for the \nindustry: “we ultimately have to do something about these things, or we may not survive…” \n Growers ‘want to do the right thing’ but need support \nMany participants identified that farmers “want to leave their land in better shape than what they found \nit”.  As said by one participant:  \n“I think we all want to do the right thing and introduce biodiversity wherever we \ncan.” \nHowever, some participants also recognised that in practice, not all farmers reach this goal, and that there \nis room for improvement.  As said by one participant as part of this discussion: “if I had a dollar for every \ntime that I’d heard that we’d be doing a lot better than we’re doing.” \n \n \nKey finding \nUncertainty about the meaning of the term biodiversity and its relevance \nto farming practices could limit grower engagement in industry programs \nOverall, most respondents welcomed industry leadership on this issue.  \nHowever, any industry-wide initiative about biodiversity should \ncommunicate a clear definition of biodiversity and specific ways that it \nwill be relevant to cotton growers  \n \n16 \n \n \nPERCEPTIONS ABOUT REVEGETATION AND REGENERATION  \nMotivating factors \nBenefits for productivity \nSome participants shared their experiences with revegetation and that they had experienced benefits in \nproductivity. For example, one participant stated that they experienced a substantial increase in \nproductivity in a particular vegetated area: “We're pushing up to 400% increase in productivity \nunderneath old coolabah trees across our landscape, that's phenomenal.” \nMany of the secondary benefits for revegetation on productivity that emerged during discussions related to \nintegrated pest management. One participant indicated that having beneficial birds and insects in vegetated \nareas saves “$50 per hectare sprays and insecticide, that adds up every day of the week”.  A number of \nparticipants indicated that it would be useful to have more information about the specific benefits of these \nservices, and to be able to put a value on these:  \n“…a big thing [regarding] this insect, bird and bat spectrum [is] trying to analyse \nhow much contribution they give to control of pest insects.” \nIn addition to benefits of natural pest management, a number of participants talked about benefits of \nshelterbelts for reducing spray drift and costs associated with pesticide use. One participant shared \nexperience of international practices, where shelterbelts could also contribute to reducing erosion, soil loss \nand spread of crop diseases.  \nAnother benefit mentioned related to revegetation and insect populations was benefits to populations of \nbees and other pollinators.  One participant mentioned that showcasing and marketing bee-friendly \npractices could be a way to promote good practices:  \n“…the whole world is aware of bees now, [if we could say] ‘no bees are harmed’, I \nthink that would really resonate [with the community]”. \nBeing able to see positive change  \nMany participants described enjoying and appreciating visible changes in the landscape or wildlife \npresence that occurred after revegetation activities. One participant described how a colleague who has \nbeen engaging in revegetation activities for some time, has started to see native grasses return that hadn’t \nbeen seen on the property for decades.  Other participants described enjoying birds and wildlife. As one \nstated: “I've never seen so many Zebra finches… it's pretty exciting to see”.  \nWith regard to seeing the benefits of revegetation, one participant described how it can be difficult for \npeople to conceptualise if they don’t yet have anything on their farm: For some participants, being able to \n\n \n17 \n \nsee the difference between their farm and other areas provided important insights about the benefits of \nrevegetation:  \n“…there was [another] farm with very little biodiversity around, that gave us an \nopportunity to see the difference” \nChallenges \nFinancial costs \nA consistent theme arising in all workshop discussions related to the financial impacts of revegetation \nactivities. The types of financial impacts discussed were diverse.  For some, the upfront costs of labour \nand materials—posed a significant cost to growers.  For example, one grower mentioned that a budget for \n3.7 km of trees (both planting and maintenance) to ensure survival for 5 years was about $50,000.   \nIn addition to upfront costs, many practices confer an ongoing negative impact on financial returns. This \nwas viewed as an especially important consideration for revegetation, which involves changing land use \nfrom production-related activities to non-production. One participant described how they would love to \nrevegetate some areas of the farm, but the ongoing financial impacts of converting cropping areas to non-\ncropping areas for revegetation activities would be too great.  Overall, participants indicated that farms \nwere businesses and needed to be profitable. As described by one participant:  \nWe want an economic return on what we do, we don't want it to be costing us money, \nevery year \nWhile funding programs (see later section) could compensate for some of these costs, some participants \nnoted that funding programs did not necessarily cover all the costs of the required actions. One participant \ndescribed applying for a grant for funding for biodiversity activities, and said “it would cost more to do \nwhat they expect than the payment that you receive in return\".   \nIn many cases, financial costs were viewed as a barrier to more widespread adoption and many \nparticipants perceived that growers would not adopt because of these costs. As described by one \nparticipant: “if you actually asked them to go and plant those trees and pay for those trees they probably \nwouldn't do it” \nRelated to financial impacts, some participants raised concerns about allocating land to non-production \nareas and the negative impacts that this would have on productivity. One participant highlighted that \nproductivity was always a priority for farming: “from a farming point of view, productivity is going to be \nthe number one.” \nBenefits accrue over long time periods  \nOne of the challenges with revegetation is that benefits are typically accrued over long time periods. For \nexample one participant indicated that if a revegetation program takes 10 years or more to deliver a benefit \nor return, then many people will be less likely to adopt the practice. Another participant described how \ntheir farm generates economic returns quicky, but ‘feel good’ projects (such as revegetation) do not \ngenerate rapid returns. This aligns with research that shows delayed rewards are less likely to motivate \nchange than immediate rewards.   \nSome participants who did engage in revegetation activities described how they had a long-term vision, \nand that the benefits were for the longer term and future generations: “it’s not for us, it's for the kids in \nprimary school now, to get the benefit… down the track”. \nCompatibility with farm conditions \n \n18 \n \nThe capacity for a grower to engage in a practice, and their capacity to expect to generate benefits, was in \nmany cases dependent on characteristics of the on-farm environment.   \nFor example, the opportunity to engage in revegetation activities can be limited by drought, or insufficient \nwater.  As one participant said, farming in a dry landscape is a barrier to thinking about tree planting \nactivities. Another participant described the challenges in ensuring newly planted trees survive and \nbecome established. \nParticipants described how farm size can impact opportunity and capacity to engage in certain practices. \nSpecifically, many participants felt that larger farms had more capacity to consider biodiversity \nmanagement practices than smaller farms.  In some cases, this related to the size of the business, where \nlarger businesses were perceived to have more capacity to consider new practices. In other cases, this \nrelated to physical opportunity to adopt new practices, where smaller farms were perceived to have fewer \nareas that could be used for biodiversity management:  \n“… the larger the farm they might have more area that they can do that. It's \nprobably a little bit harder for the smaller farm.” \nWhile a small farm was perceived to offer fewer physical opportunities to consider new practices, for \nsome respondents, poor access to certain areas of the farm could also constrain opportunity to adopt a new \npractice. In some cases, the presence of irrigation and other farming infrastructure also impacted \nsuitability of certain practices.  As stated by one participant:  \n“...Revegetation, and that kind of thing is, is, to large extent impractical when you’ve \ngot irrigation infrastructure around the place.” \nRevegetation is not simple – conceptually or practically \nWith regard to revegetation, a range of challenges were identified, related to accessing plant stock, and \npromoting effective growth in difficult conditions. A number of participants stated that it is difficult, or in \nsome cases “totally impossible” to source and access plants that are suitable for revegetation. This resulted \nin some participants shifting to practices which involved direct seeding.  As described by one participant:  \n“…[a challenge is] actually getting plants to plant, there’s hardly any nurseries, you \ncan't get the plants, so that's difficult…”  \nMany participants highlighted that keeping trees alive can be difficult, especially in drought conditions.  \nA number of discussions highlighted that revegetation is not just about trees.  One participant highlighted \nthat while “planting trees looks fabulous” that there may be greater benefits and survival of seeds. A \nnumber of participants highlighted the importance of soil health, not just in cropping areas, but across a \nrange of farm systems.  As stated by one participant: “when you start seeing grasses then we start to see \nbetter fungal numbers, so we're really focused, I guess, on how we can regenerate some of our country \nthrough getting particularly fungi back into our soils.” \nLack of information or knowledge  \nSome participants indicated that they feel their current knowledge about a practice is not sufficient to \nsupport adoption.  For example, with regard to revegetation, one participant described that they needed to \nknow where to find information, what types of species to plant, and the suitable density of planting.  \nSimilarly, another participant described wanting to know more about suitable species for their area, and \nwhat is typically required to ensure revegetation thrives.   \n“I need to know a lot more about what different species need. I don't know enough \nabout what's there and what it needs to stay there, and what it needs to thrive.” \n \n19 \n \nParticipants in all the workshops described the complex relationships between biodiversity management \npractices and impacts on diverse parts of the farm. One participant describes uncertainty about the best \napproach given the possibility of an unintended negative impact:  \n\"I think sometimes we don't know what to do, - we do something that can have a \nnegative impact\" \nDiscussions suggested that the potential for practices to have a negative or unpredictable impact on \nbiodiversity results in hesitancy to embrace these practices and could act as a barrier to adoption.   \nCompatibility with farming systems and geography \nDiscussions revealed that many aspects of the farm itself could support revegetation activities or create a \nbarrier to engaging in revegetation. For example, some respondents suggested that larger farms had greater \nopportunity—in terms of space—to engage in revegetation than smaller farms. Another participant \ndescribed their farming setting: because they had limited areas for substantial revegetation projects, that \nthey looked to introduce shrubbery in non-productive areas, such as under power lines.  \nSome participants described planning for revegetation can be constrained by the physical presence of \nfarming infrastructure.  As described by one participant:  \n“Revegetation, and that kind of thing is to large extent impractical when you’ve got \nirrigation infrastructure around the place” \nThe opportunity to engage in revegetation activities was also considered to be limited by drought or \ninsufficient water. As one participant said, farming in a dry landscape is a barrier to thinking about tree \nplanting activities. Another participant described the challenges in ensuring newly planted trees survive \nand become established. \n“…water has been quite limited. We've got some wildlife corridors, and we've lost \nprobably 50% of the trees within those areas. They're quite hard to get water to, with \nthat low rainfall.” \nBenefits undermined by secondary impacts \nMany participants described the complex relationships between revegetation practices and impacts on \ndiverse parts of the farm. Some discussions revealed that revegetation practices can provide entry points \nfor weed dispersal and undermine effective weed management approaches.  \nGrowers are at diverse stages of the ‘biodiversity journey’ \nOne issue that emerged a number of times in discussions related the need for clear goals about biodiversity \nmanagement strategies. In the context of revegetation, this related to clarifying whether protecting existing \nvegetation was considered and ‘rewarded’ in a similar way to revegetation activities. For example, one \nparticipant shared their experience of finding it challenging to acquire funding for biodiversity projects \nbecause they had established trees that required maintenance—as opposed to planning to plant new trees. \nTheir experience suggested that “people don't seem to value even trees that are say 30 years old” \ncompared to new tree planting. This ambiguity could create a barrier to engagement, especially in those \nwith established trees seeking support for maintaining ecosystem quality.   \nStrategies to strengthen revegetation and regeneration activities \nFinancial incentives and innovative ways to value biodiversity \nIn addition to traditional grants and incentives, much of the discussion about financial support for \nrevegetation activities turned to innovative ways to value biodiversity, such as carbon farming or \n \n20 \n \nbiodiversity credits. Some participants expressed enthusiasm for the opportunities that these schemes \nprovided, as shared by one participant:  \n“I think that carbon [farming] is the greatest opportunity that agriculture has ever \nseen, and I think it’ll be the greatest opportunity that I’ll see in my farming lifetime” \nWithin the context of discussions on initiatives such as carbon farming, some participants expressed \nconcerns about the negative impacts on production.  In turn, participants were concerned that reduced \nproductivity would also generate negative social impacts, such as loss of jobs, and secondary effects such \nas downturn in local communities. One participant said that biodiversity management initiatives \n“shouldn't have negative socio-economic impacts on the community.” \nInformation, education and extension \nDiscussions reveals that many participants were uncertain about identifying optimal tree or plant species \nfor certain areas. As such, much of the conversation about information provision focused on advice about \nselecting species for particular geographic areas. One participant also described a situation where farmers \non a neighbouring property were asking to see how they planted trees and maintained them, highlighting \nthe potential contribution of skills-based extension in the areas of revegetation.  Some discussions also \nhighlighted the importance of clear information and support in navigating information services.  \nA number of participants highlighted the importance of providing growers with measurement tools to both \nassess ‘where they were at’ as well as gauge success, and “knowing if you get it right”.  One grower \ndiscussed the importance of demonstration sites as a way of learning from others.   \nCreate flexible and simple entry points to encourage people with diverse needs to engage \nFeeling that an activity is achievable is an important part of building a sense of capacity.  Aligned with \nthis, many participants suggested that keeping it simple, or keeping it small to begin with would engage \nmore growers than focusing only on large-scale projects.  As described by one participant:  \n“… if people start having those small wins and then the benefit from just one thing. \nNot trying to do [everything] at once, or, you know, just to in manageable sizes that, \nyeah, that aren't overwhelming in amongst everything else that people have got \ngoing on in their life” \nSome participants highlighted that, when considering revegetation projects, they would like the flexibility \nto choose where to locate things like wildlife corridors, rather than overarching rules about what was \nrequired.  \n  \n \n21 \n \n \nPERCEPTIONS ABOUT STRENGTHENING STOCK EXCLUSION FROM \nRIPARIAN AREA \nMotivating factors \nEasy to see beneficial impacts  \nBeing able to observe the impacts of a new management practices has the potential to reinforce adoption \nand support continuing engagement in these practices. Some participants discussed being able to see on-\nground changes, such as plant growth, after excluding stock from riparian areas. One participant described \nhow they were surprised at the types of changes observed over the longer term after stock exclusion \npractices and how seeing this reinforced the impact of stock and stock exclusion practices:  \n“… to see the impact ten years down the track is pretty eye opening, particularly \nwith those native grasses, and how much they are impacted by, not just stock, but all \nanimals.” \nIn addition to being able to see the benefits over time, many participants also described being able to see \nclear benefits for de-stocking one area, compared to areas that have not been de-stocked. One participant \ndescribed being able to see the differences between one area of their property and an adjoining property: \n“You can see it. If one farms got riparian zone that are un-grazed and the \nneighbouring property has grazed area, the difference in the quality of the \nenvironment is very noticeable” \nIn some situations, de-stocking may be easier than stocking \nFor some participants, identifying riparian areas that were difficult to stock (or crop) provided an \nopportunity to take positive action for biodiversity. As they describe:  \n“…well, it was hard to stock, and you couldn't really crop it, so thought we'll do \nsomething good for the environment. Take it back to what it was.” \nAnother participant described that protecting riverine areas didn’t require as many ‘active measures’ as \nrevegetation, and all that was required was fencing and taking stock off the area:  \n“…fencing off a riverine environment. If you did that, that’ll help. You don’t have to \nplant necessarily, you just let it come back, just take the stock off.” \nDespite this practice being seen as an ‘easy win’ by some participants, it is important to note that many \ngrowers have minimal or no grazing stock. \nChallenges to strengthening stock exclusion from riparian areas \n\n \n22 \n \nCost and effort involved in fencing \nWhile some participants found stock exclusion a relatively easy practice (compared to some high intensity \npractices), many participants pointed out that the financial and labour costs of installing and maintaining \nfencing could be considerable, and a barrier to engaging in this practice. One participant described that \nwhen finances were tight, many growers would not bother:  \n“There’s capital and ongoing costs to doing all of this, which means a lot of people \njust say, oh, I can't be bothered. … water from the river is a lot cheaper than putting \na pump from a trough.” \nOne participant described how balancing the fluctuating and competing needs relating to time and money, \nand the windows of opportunities relating to water level, often meant that these activities were not \nprioritised.  As they described:  \n“When the rivers are low enough for you to do something, then you've got no cash \nand then once you're busy, you're busy cropping and getting cash flow, and it is one \nof those things that does get pushed to the back burner … when you've got the time, \nyou haven't got the money. When you've got the money, you don't have the time.” \nLoss of water access points \nSome discussions revealed that for some growers, riverine areas provided important water access points \nwith no immediately available alternative. Some participants highlighted, even when stock had been \nexcluded from riparian areas, these water access points became more important in times of drought, which \ncould led to reintroduction of stock in these areas. As described in one discussion: “all the good intentions \nin the world can come undone when finances are tight or … animals are starving” \nLimited access to some riparian areas \nA number of participants identified that in some areas, physical access to riparian areas was challenging, \ndue to certain geographical features, and that this would create a barrier to maintaining fencing in these \nareas.  Floods impacts also made it difficult to maintain fencing.  \nCost in managing unintended emergence of weed species and feral animal populations \nMany participants raised the issue that excluding stock from riparian or riverine areas would rebound \npresence of invasive weed species, and this would require additional management.  One participant \ndescribed how managing the secondary impacts of destocking were quite substantial:  \n“Quite often when we have excluded or locked up areas, they also become \nsecondary issues with bushfire, pests, noxious weeds. So a locked up area that's not \nmanaged has its own massive set of issues and challenges”. \nIn some cases, the grazing pressure from feral animals such as goats, or pressure from other feral species \nwere perceived to also undermine the benefits of stock exclusion.  \nLack of clarity about whether all stocking or only high-density stocking needed to change \nOne of the challenges with many areas of practice change is determining whether all levels of a particular \npractice need to be changed, or only practices of a certain intensity.  This had an influence on discussions \nabout stock exclusion.  Some participants suggested that low numbers of stock have a negligible impact, \nwhereas other suggested that temporary cycles of destocking and restocking might be suitable.  \nAs described by one participant: “I don't really think our stock impact our river so much… we're not big \ngraziers or anything” \n \n23 \n \nStrategies that could support strengthening stock exclusion practices \nFinancial support \nMany of the discussions raised the issue of how funding support could enhance uptake of this practice. \nThe types of funding mechanisms mentioned were diverse.  While some focused on incentives or schemes \nto cover the cost of fencing, many discussed opportunities for innovative funding mechanisms based on \nrevegetation or regeneration of riparian areas.  As discussed above in the context of vegetation \nmanagement, some of these discussions drew from carbon farming initiatives.  In response to a question \nabout what would enable them to protect more riparian areas, one participant stated:  \n“More funding and hopefully more awareness of how important carbon farming is \nand some value on carbon farming” \nNonetheless, some participants viewed that financial incentives would not lead to practice change for \neveryone. One participant described the importance of developing ‘enduring mechanisms’ where farmers \ncould benefit from biodiversity protection.   \nConcern about non-voluntary approaches \nThe discussion about whether financial incentives could motivate practice change then led into discussions \nabout alternative strategies, including non-voluntary approaches such as regulations.  Overall, most \nparticipants were wary of regulatory approaches and felt that they could undermine engagement. As put \nforward by one participant, regulatory approaches would need wide-spread industry and grower support to \nbe suitable:  \n“…regulating what you can and can't do - maybe that is the way of the future. But \nthere would have to be an awful lot of support to come with that kind of regulation to \nsay, ‘we’re not to have any livestock in a riparian area’” \n  \n \n24 \n \n \nPERCEPTIONS ABOUT STRENGTHENING WEED MANAGEMENT  \nMotivating factors \nWeed management is part of farming routine \nAll participants shared experiences and challenges related to weed management. Because the workshops \nwere held across diverse farm types, and different geographic areas, the specific weed-type that was the \nfocus for each participant varied.  \nChallenges to strengthening weed management \nFinancial, time and labour costs \nMost participants indicated that weeds posed an ongoing management challenge, and that one of the key \nchallenges related to the cost of effective weed management.  As stated by one participant about \nstrengthening weed management practices: “we would love to able to do it. It's just not something that \neconomically is viable for us”  Many participants described that weed management often requires \nextensive manual labour (e.g. spraying from backpacks, accessing areas using quad bikes) which poses \nsignificant labour costs. These costs can be hard to justify when the practice doesn’t generate a financial \nreturn. One participant described that “we can’t justify [these intensive practices] for what we're getting \nout of the country”.  \nWhile the online survey indicated that many respondents find it easy to do the specific practices on their \nfarm, discussion in workshops revealed that many aspects of these practices were challenging.  For \nexample, many participants described the challenges of effective weed management, especially in riverine \nenvironments or where accessibility is limited by thick undergrowth. As stated by one participant:  \n“controlling the weeds in these riverine areas would be very difficult to do.” \n“every time you have a flood, a brand new species of weed pops up that you didn't \nhave before” \nFor some respondents, poor access to certain areas of the farm could also constrain opportunities to adopt \nnew practices.  Farming country that had major gullies or was heavily treed was considered harder to \naccess for activities such as management of weeds or feral animals.  In some cases, large woody weeds in \nthickets makes it difficult to access areas for weed control.  \nOne participant described how in many other parts of life, new technologies make life easier, but that this \ndoesn’t apply to weed management:  \n\n \n25 \n \n“…it's difficult. Yeah, in the rest of our lives, things are becoming easier and easier, \nor more convenient. These particular things [related to weed management] are very \nhard.” \nLack of coordination and area-wide management \nParticipants highlighted that the practices of others in the region was an important influence on adoption \nof weed management practices.  It was considered very challenging to manage weeds on farm if \nneighbouring properties did not contribute to effective weed management, due to dispersal of weeds. One \nparticipant described their situation:  \n“we do our best to control boxthorn, and they [neighbouring property] don't really \ndo anything to manage their weed situation, which makes our work twice as hard”  \n \nConcern about unintended negative impacts \nA number of participants also described how certain approaches to weed management could have a \nnegative impact on other vegetation. For example, one participant describes how widespread application \nof herbicides can harm vegetation areas: “I’d love to go in there with a plane and hit that [weed species] \nbut then you bugger up your trees”.   \nAnother participant described the potential negative effects of weed removal on bird life: \n“If we do go in and clear the buckthorn, and briars and things, we may well have a \ndetrimental effect on our small bird life that's down there. So it is a real balancing \nthing” \nDifferent problem orientation \nWhile most people viewed strengthening weed management as a viable action, and aligned with farm \nneeds, not every participant shared the same perspective about the problems of weed management.  \nOne participant felt that existing practices were adequate, and that additional effort was not required: “I \ndon't see a need to strengthen our weed management program too much more, or, we've got a pretty good \nhandle on what we should be doing.” \nAnother participant indicated that they were not worried about weeds: “I'm not worried about weeds. We \ncan handle weeds—if you can grow weeds, you can grow crops.” \nA number of participants also discussed the challenge in interpreting what was a weed, and what was not.  \nFor example, some species were native, but operated as a weed in farming country. Conversely, some \nviewed weed species as part of biodiversity, and that chemical control could pose a stronger threat to \nbiodiversity than the weed itself.  \nStrategies that could support strengthening weed management \nA range of strategies were discussed that could strengthen weed management. \nCoordination and area wide management \nMost participants agreed that area-wide approaches were important for effective weed management. As \nsaid by one participant:  \n“If you're on a watercourse, especially, everyone's got to be on board, otherwise \nyou're going to be constantly spending the money to other people's problems.” \n \n26 \n \nHowever, there was recognition that coordinated approaches were not simple, and required organisational \ninput. As stated by one participant: “someone needs to run it. That's always the crux of these things” \nProvide financial support and extension \nParticipants discussed a range of types of support that would help them or other farmers strengthen weed \nmanagement.  Financial incentives were discussed as one option to offset the financial costs of weed \nmanagement. One participant said: “it’s a dollar factor. Ultimately what gets people over the line with \nthings is an incentive.” \nOther types of support discussed were education and extension, to provide knowledge about the benefits \nof weed management and the importance of ‘getting everyone on the same page’. One participant also \nhighlighted that some would also benefit from support in engaging with coordinated approaches, to offset \nthe time and transactional costs involved in reporting and applying for funding. For example:  \nthere’s quite often a bit of reporting that goes with it and trying to get even a 1-\npager filled out can be very difficult at times … it requires quite a lot of detail to \nwork within those programs. So, having someone that's helping farmers [would be] \nbeneficial” \nShare stories of what people are already doing \nDiscussions about diverse weed management practices revealed that most participants recognised that \nfarmers varied in the degree to which they engaged in strong weed management practices.  Importantly, \nthe positive practices of some farmers were seen as an opportunity to encourage others to adopt those \npractices, and that social influence was an important way to inspire practice change. As said by one \nparticipant:  \n“it’ll evolve with peer pressure. The more famers that jump in the boat and do these \nthings, [then] the guys that aren’t doing want to jump in and make sure there’s a \nseat in the boat” \nTrial planting of native grasses \nOne participant suggested that trial patches of native grasses might be an important way to test the \npotential for these grasses to spread and replace weeds, reducing the need for weed removal.  \n  \n \n27 \n \n \nPERCEPTIONS ABOUT STRENGTHENING MANAGEMENT OF FERAL \nANIMALS  \nMotivating factors \nManagement of feral animals is part of farming routine \nLike weed management, management of feral animals was a common part of the farming routine. All \nparticipants shared experiences and challenges related to the management of feral animals. Because the \nworkshops were held across diverse farm types, and different geographic areas, the specific feral species \nthat were the focus for each participant varied. Nonetheless, participants described being able to witness \nmany feral animal species.  \nChallenges to strengthening management of feral animals \nFinancial, time and labour costs \nDiscussions revealed that many approaches to managing feral animals were expensive, especially related \nto the actual costs of purchasing baiting systems. One participant described that grants did not always \ncover the full costs involved.  \nSome control methods are challenging or inadequate \nSome species, such as feral cats, were viewed as particularly difficult to bait or trap effectively.  For \nexample, one participant described the challenges of controlling feral cats:  \n“Because they like the live kill, they’re also tricky to trap. [So] apart from people \nwalking around with shotguns I don’t know what else you can do” \nSimilar to the challenges of weed management, some country was difficult to access due to the physical \ngeography, such as gullies or trees. This makes it difficult or expensive to deploy feral animal control \nmethods in these areas.  \nLack of coordination and area-wide management \nParticipants highlighted that the practices of others in the region was an important influence on adoption.  \nAs described by one participant, managing feral cats on one property is unlikely to generate meaningful \nbenefits in the long term if neighbouring properties are not also managing feral cats effectively:  \n“I think that's the whole point of biodiversity. … you can't just look after your own \npatch, it's a bigger picture —there's no point in me killing all our cats if they’re just \ngonna breed up next door…” \n\n \n28 \n \nOne participant described their frustration when, even after discussing feral dog problems with \nneighbours, a single neighbour acts without consultant or working collaboratively with neighbours. As \nthey describe:  \n“…often when you're talking to a neighbour, we, end up talking about [feral] dogs \n— and then you'll find that one neighbour has gone and done a 1080 program. And \nthey ring up to say, ‘oh, we just put 1080 round ...keep your dogs locked up’ and [I \nwill think] ‘What the hell - Why didn't we talk about this as a group?’” \nFocusing on species that impact productivity rather than biodiversity \nMany participants described that there was generally more support for management of feral animals than \nthere was for weed control. This was perceived to be related to greater issue visibility and clear negative \neconomic impacts associated with some feral species. As described by one participant in response to this \ndiscussion: \n\"[feral animals are] easier to manage and also like it’s the same cost for everyone. \nSo if everyone's involved, there's no inequity in the cost of managing it… in terms of \nanimal control, they're a much easier thing to see and control, they’re cheaper. It's \neasier to organize a group of people to do it. … Pigs will come in and cause an \neconomic impact far more than some of the invasive woody weeds. So people are \nmore willing to spend money getting rid of them” \nSpecies that had a less visible impact on crops and productivity could go under the radar:  \n“we’re not so worried about the foxes and cats just because they're not obvious and \nthey don’t seem to be doing too much to the crops themselves … they’re not front of \nmind because they're not eating the sorghum” \nWhile impacts on economic productivity was a strong motivator for participants to support feral animal \ncontrol measures, discussions revealed that focusing on species with negative economic impacts could \n‘distract’ from control of species that were more important for biodiversity. As described by two \nparticipants:  \n“we’ve got a lot of ‘roo pressure here on our wheat … even though they’re not feral, \nI think they are [a pest]” \n\"I know we talk ferals but ... 300 brolgas are every bit as damaging [to crops]… \nWhen a population gets out of whack, then, anything is a pest” \nStrategies that could support strengthening management of feral animals \nA range of strategies were discussed that could strengthen management of feral animals. \nCoordination and area wide management \nSimilar to weed management, there was general support for coordinated or area-wide approaches to feral \nanimal control. As stated by one participant:  \n“I think we need to get better at working with the neighbours, we're not great at \nthat.” \nAnother participant suggested that coordination and funding would make an important contribution to \npractice change: “co-ordination and funding are probably the two things that would get a bit of action \naround here.” \n \n \n29 \n \nAs mentioned above, discussions revealed that many participants believed that coordinated approaches \nwould be easier for feral control than weed management. This was strongly related to issue visibility and \nproblem agreement. One participant stated: \n\"Yeah, the feral animals …It seems to be much easier to get agreement between \npeople that live close by to control them whilst they’re mobile - they're almost not as \nmobile as weeds can be” \nSome discussion about area-wide approaches focused on coordinating funding or motivating individuals in \na particular area, while other participants suggested that having coordinated support for things like \nsurveillance (“having someone come in and doing surveillance on number of goats”) would help \nindividual growers and support area-wide management.  \nWhile there was a general perception of strong problem agreement about feral animal control, some \nparticipants suggested that there will always be “people who don’t want to be part of it… that’s just human \nnature” \nProvision of information and support – but avoid information overload \nProvision of information was suggested as a helpful strategy to support area-wide management. As \ndescribed by one participant:  \n“if there was a bit more advertising around that area, [for example] ‘now is the \nmonths to go after foxes’” \nHowever, some participants highlighted that information is not usually enough to support change, and that \nsome growers may experience information overload:  \n“I get the need for more education, but, how many of the information sheets that \ncome in the mailbox or on e-mail, do you comprehensively read, before you put them \nin the bin? Sometimes I feel like that stuff is wasted effort” \nProvide opportunities to learn from other growers \nIn the discussions about learning and information provision, many participants highlighted that learning \nfrom other growers, hearing about their experience and seeing it on their farm was an important part of \npractice change:  \n\" Seeing it occur on someone's farm, and that peer-to-peer discussion seems to work \nwhen you gather a group of grower's together. And they're actually visually seeing \nthe benefits\" \nWhile visiting other farms in local areas was deemed to be the easiest way to do this (from the perspective \nof time and travel costs), this participant suggested that there are also strong benefits to seeing what \ngrowers are doing in other regions.  \n  \n \n30 \n \nSTRATEGIES TO PROMOTE UPTAKE OF PRACTICES \nDevelop industry targets \nMost participants support clear industry targets \nOverall, most participants indicated support for industry-led programs with clear targets. One participant \nstated: “I certainly think there's a significant place for the cotton industry to be involved”.  Some \nparticipants emphasised the need for clear goals.  As said by one participant: “I'd really like to see some \ngoals and objectives… that we’re going to work towards as an industry… There needs to be solid \nstandards.” \nSome participants suggested that industry-led programs would be more successful than alternative \nprograms.  For example, one stated: “industry programs seem to get a lot more traction, than something \nthat government puts [out].” Another participant felt that specific directions and goals would also \nstrengthen success:  “If I had some quite strong direction from industry, … that will assist with this \noutcome.” \nTargets need to be achievable \nMany participants highlighted the need for targets to be achievable, and applicable to diverse regions and \nfarming contexts:  \n“What, I guess, what I'm hoping to get out of it, is, like, if we do have some targets, \nthey need to be realistic and achievable, and applicable for our region.” \n“Start small and build up to it, rather than a ridiculous, unachievable target to start \nwith, which would turn people away from the whole concept.” \nConsider achievable entry points \nWhile not a dominant feature of the discussions, many participants mentioned that being able to begin at a \nsmaller scale—and know the benefits of small changes—would help them to consider new practices: “if \nwe kept it basic … that would be a starting point.” Sometimes this related to accessibility and logistics of \nnew practices, whereas for other responses, this related to juggling demands of everyday life.  For \nexample, in a discussion about revegetation, one participant suggested that recommendations for large \nchanges would be overwhelming, and that starting small would be more feasible: “Not trying to do \n[everything] at once, just to do manageable sizes that aren't overwhelming” \nIn some cases, it was thought that smaller-scale projects would also have better chances being integrated \ninto farming practices and being successful.  One participant described having seen others take on large \nprojects, but ended up unsuccessful because they were not managed well.  This participant highlighted the \nimportance of being able to fit in with routines: “… it has to be, something that you can do, as well as \ndoing all the other tasks on your farm.” \nRecognise existing achievements and individual farm characteristics \nA challenge highlighted by some participants stemmed from the fact that growers may be at different \nstages on the ‘journey’ of biodiversity management. Some participants described how many funding \ninitiatives are targeted towards people beginning small scale contributions to initiatives, such as \nrevegetation initiatives. While these programs were recognised as important, they were thought to be less \nsuitable for individuals who had made some progress on biodiversity management, or who had existing \nvegetated areas on farm and were seeking support to manage these areas effectively for biodiversity \noutcomes.  When initiatives focus on providing entry points to enable growers to begin adoption of \npractices, this may create challenges for those who have made a start and would like to consolidate and \nstrengthen their existing practices. This frustration was expressed by one participant:  \n \n31 \n \n“it gets quite frustrating … there is no real talk around how we can fund the people \nthat have passed phase one?” \nThis related to the discussion about clarity of goals mentioned above, and the need to clarify whether \nindustry-led initiatives are seeking to increase biodiversity on farm, or look after biodiversity that \ncurrently exists.  As described by one participant: “the challenge is - are we looking after existing \nbiodiversity or are we trying to replant, build biodiversity?” \nPreference for voluntary approaches \nWhile most participants were supportive of industry-led targets, there was concern about whether this \nwould result in implementation of regulatory approaches that would mandate or restrict certain activities. \nSome indicated a role for mandated practices “most people won't do it, unless they have to”, and the \nimportance of clarifying what practices were appropriate: “I think that's a big thing that we need to work \nout, what people can and can't do.” However, most respondents indicated that most growers would prefer \nto apply targets in a more flexible way, and that overly restrictive approaches may not promote \nengagement. As described by one participant: “Targets always make me nervous. It's just that people \nchoose to pick up on the negative areas.” \nProvide financial support and innovative ways to value biodiversity \nStrong support for financial incentives  \nAligned with the major discussion on financial impacts of biodiversity management practices (as \ndiscussed above), part of the solutions discussed that would enable more growers to participate in these \npractices involved initiatives that provided financial support.  Incentive programs could potentially serve \nto motivate participation in new practices, and by at least partly covering costs, would increase capacity of \nmany growers to adopt new practices. As described by one participant:  \n“…there needs to be incentives - because it's not primary business probably for \nanyone to do this” \nOne participant stated that if growers had to cover the cost of initiatives such as revegetation, then this \nwould be a barrier to engaging in this practice: “…if you actually asked them to go and plant those trees \nand pay for those trees, they probably wouldn't do it.” While most participants indicated that financial \nsupport was an important part of any industry initiative, some participants also recognised that financial \nsupport alone would not motivate everyone, and that some growers are just likely to be less interested in \nthese practices.  \nConsider how to value biodiversity in new ways  \nParticipants recognised that traditional approaches to valuing farming land do not adequately recognise \nbroader values, such as those related to biodiversity management.  As described by one participant, the \ncapacity for land to generate ecosystem services is not always recognised, and therefore not adequately \nvalued:  \n“A valuer will tell you that country's only worth [a particular amount] ... But the \nscience around [what] ecosystem services … contribute to the cropping system is \npretty well established…It's just that we're not conditioned to see it.” \nDiscussions suggested that not being able to adequately value biodiversity and related ecosystem services \nwould limit uptake of biodiversity management practices.  A number of discussions revealed that specific \napproaches to valuing biodiversity on farm were complex. One participant described a conversation with a \nneighbour about the challenges of valuing things such as wildlife on farm: “…he showed me a photo of a \nkoala that he'd taken down the river on his farm and I said, I asked him how much he thought it [the \nkoala] was worth, and… we had a chat about it, like, what is it worth?.  Another participant suggested that \n \n32 \n \nolder trees should be valued in a different way to new trees, suggesting that “surely a 200-year-old tree is \nworth more than a one-year-old tree.” \nCarbon farming initiatives provided a potential example of how environmental services could be \nfinancially valued and provide ongoing credits to farmers. One participant described the importance of \nmarket-based financial incentives: “We need a financial reward and the way you have financial reward is \nto have a trading platform that you can trade your biodiversity …” \nSome participants had positive experiences of carbon farming programs, and many others were interested \nin the potential benefits that a program could generate. The enthusiasm that some participants expressed \nabout these initiatives was seen in one comment: “ that's the brilliant idea to talk about carbon farming. \n… at the end of the day to have some sort of a payoff.”.   \nMany participants were curious about whether a ‘biodiversity credits’ system would be feasible for the \ncotton industry: “people are asking the questions - is there a way that we can offset the cost of doing this \n[biodiversity management] in country that's currently not productive?”  \nSome participants discussed that, while there may be some overlapping practices that supported both \ncarbon credits and biodiversity credits, there may be points of divergence in goals. In particular, one \nparticipant describe how this might play out when planning revegetation initiatives: if carbon was the only \nfocus, then this would support planting trees, but important ecosystem elements to support biodiversity \ncould be overlooked, such as understory and ground covers.    \n“…if they're not on the biodiversity [pathway] early enough, people will go down \nthe carbon route, simply revegetating with tree—not putting in the ground covers, \nand the lower story stuff, which is all really important to get a fully diverse \necosystem. So, they're going to have to be on the biodiversity with carbon \nbandwagon”  \nAnother participant highlighted the importance of acting quickly to value the more complex elements of \nbiodiversity management practices, suggesting that if the industry didn’t act on the current opportunity, \nthen the opportunity could be lost: “you already have a new industry out there, which is the carbon \nindustry. … I think if the biodiversity isn't part of that somehow, then I do feel like biodiversity will get \nlost.”  \nRecognition that other financial influences may emerge  \nSome participants highlighted that banks and financial programs were beginning to consider the \nsustainability of agriculture as part of their financing approaches, and suggested that ‘green financing’ \napproaches would also have an influence on how the industry tackled challenges related to biodiversity. \nOne participant stated: “I notice banks and insurance are really looking closely at this side of \nagriculture.”  \nWhile this may not be something the cotton industry can directly influence, understanding the broader \ncontext of financing may provide opportunities to integrate industry-led initiatives with the broader culture \nof financial systems. In addition, some emerging discussion suggested that growers could benefit from \nsupport tools that enabled them to assess their status with regards to sustainability. For example, one \nparticipant was asked by their bank if their farm had a ‘sustainability statement’. Because they didn’t \nknow what this looked like, this participant suggested that support for developing these tools would be \nuseful:  \n“We were asked in our annual relationship meeting with our banker if we had a \n‘sustainability statement’. ‘Actually, no we don’t, what does that look like? Just send \nus an example and we'll develop our own.’ …I don't even know what that looks like.  \n… so creating some tools for growers around that would I think be a real \nopportunity for us” \n \n33 \n \nOne participant highlighted that stronger performance on environmental indicators may also influence \ndecisions about investing in farms, where farms with strong performance on environmental management \nmay be more attractive to buyers.  \nInformation, education, and advice \nProvide clear information and advice \nMany participants described a need for information and advice about which practices were recommended, \nand how to implement these in their particular circumstance. As said by one participant”  \n“We're engaged, we‘re keen  - [But] what do we need to do? … That's where we \nneed some help” \nParticipants provided examples of areas where more support would be beneficial, related to all of the four \npractices. This related to both scale of the problem (e.g. “what damage cats are doing to the system”) and \ninformation to make better decisions (e.g. “if there was, it's a possibility of more weather stations to be put \nacross the region. that would go a long way to helping [reduce chemical inputs].”). With regard to \nrevegetation, many participants described needing more information about many aspects of this practice, \nincluding the types of plants that were appropriate for their area, where to get plants or seed, how to \nminimise negative impacts, and how to maximise growth.  \n“I need access to education … [such as information on] the sort of thing you should \nplant here and where to get that? Or, if I have to seed it myself, how do I do that? I \nstill need more education on just how to do it well...” \nIn some cases, participants highlighted the importance of more active support, such as consultants, which \ncould provide more tailored analysis of the whole farm and support an overarching management plan.  \nProvide opportunities to learn from others and directly experience new approaches \nMuch research describes how learning from others is a powerful way to support learning and promote \nadoption of new practices.  Aligned with this, many participants described the value of learning from \nneighbours and other growers.  As two participants stated:  \n“I think the successful thing is, neighbours talking to neighbours \n“I think it'd be great to look a lot more into what guys are doing around the district” \nSome participants highlighted the value of demonstration projects as a way to experience different \napproaches, while others described the importance of learning from researchers or overseas:  \n“we're starting to see some examples around the world, doing things very \ndifferently, and encouraged by that and we're starting to think about looking to do \nsome of those things ourselves.” \nIn addition to providing learning opportunities, participants also recognised that showcasing the practices \nof other growers can activate positive norms that motivate others:  \n“I think it’ll evolve with peer pressure, the more famers the jump in the boat and do \nthese things, the guys that aren’t doing it they want to jump in.” \nOne participant highlighted that demonstration projects may also be a means to strengthen community \nperceptions of the industry.  \nProvide tools to clearly gauge impact \nThe capacity to visualise a problem, or see the beneficial impact of a management practice, can influence \nadoption of a new management practice. However, discussions about the potential benefits of biodiversity \nmanagement revealed that many participants described finding it difficult to gauge the benefits of diverse \n \n34 \n \nmanagement practices. A number of participants highlighted the potential for management practices to \nhave a negative impact on biodiversity, and indicated that they would like feedback on whether they are \n‘doing the right thing’.  For example,  \n“some of it, too, is about knowing if you get it right. What are we trying to do? Is it \nactually a positive or a negative impact?” \nFor some, being able to measure the positive impact was important for justifying decisions about \nbiodiversity management practices, especially when there were trade-offs with production.  For example, \none participant described shifting pest management from insecticides to beneficial insects  \n“…trying to prove that decisions we're making around trying to trust beneficial \ninsects to carry the load when most advice is to use insecticides, has been one of the \nmore difficult things...” \nRecognise inter-connectedness of farm systems \nWhile a large part of the workshops involved asking participants about the four targeted practices, an \nimportant element to come out of these discussions is that participants don’t view these practices in \nisolation, but see them as integrated.  \nIt's a systems approach, we can't look at biodiversity just as the creek that's got a \nfew trees around it and a bit of grassland or some weeds. It's that whole systems \napproach, we need to change the mindset - it's all these sorts of things, like how this \nriparian area or biodiversity area is actually contributing to the rest of the farm \nFor example, in discussions about revegetation, discussions included secondary impacts on weeds or feral \nanimals, and the need to integrate, say, weed management, into revegetation initiatives.  Similarly, in \ndiscussions about stock exclusion from riparian areas, discussions involved investing in revegetion \nactivities in these areas and the need to manage weed dispersal via water flows.   \nCoordinated approaches \nConsider area-wide management \nParticipants described how many practices—especially those related to managing weeds or feral \nanimals—are likely to be more effective is everyone within a region engages in the practice. For many \nparticipants, this results in a discussion about the importance of area-wide management approaches.  As \none participant described: “you can actively manage [problem weeds] and then next door can be doing \nnothing. And I think that's always been an issue … the group approach is the only way to do it” \nIn addition to strengthening the impact of weed and feral management strategies, discussions revealed that \narea-wide approaches could also motivate greater participation in practices; “if you feel everyone is \nlooking to do this, then you're more likely to get involved, than if you try and do it on your own… and that \ncreates some motivation too.” However, some participants highlighted that when neighbouring properties \nwere not involved in farming, their motivation to participate in area-wide schemes may be limited.  \nCoordinated information and support services \nDiscussions about the different sources of information and support available to growers considering new \npractices revealed that many participants found it difficult to navigate the different organisations involved \nin this process. Some participants highlighted that the processes to support their engagement in sustainable \npractices were not clear. In some cases, this was confusion about which organisations were the most \nappropriate target for support. As stated by one participant: “knowing where to go to get help … is half the \nstruggle.”  For some participants, the diversity of organisation providing grants or funding opportunities \ncreated confusion. One participant described it as: “because so many people operating in these spaces, it's \nreally hard to get your head around it all.” This lack of clarity acted as a barrier for growers to apply for \n \n35 \n \nfunding. As stated by one participant: “It's awfully hard as a grower to chase down grants and things”. In \ngeneral, there was agreement that greater coordination of support and funding opportunities would be \nbeneficial for growers considering strengthening biodiversity management practices.  \nPartnering with research institutions \nA number of participants suggested that stronger partnerships with universities and research organisations \nwould be beneficial for growers and the industry. One participant highlighted the importance of  “making \nsure that we have the information coming through from researchers, and then practical examples in the \npaddock where that's working.” \nAnother participant indicated that there is a disconnect between research and on-farm practices, and \nvoiced their support for stronger alignment between these areas: “I think the CRDC need to put a lot of \neffort into bringing that expertise to the table for us.” \n  \n \n36 \n \n \n \n \nSynthesis & Recommendations \n \nGENERAL READINESS TO ENGAGE IN BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION \nOverall, workshop participants expressed interest and enthusiasm for the discussions about biodiversity \nmanagement, and valued the opportunity to share their views and experiences.  In general, the majority of \nparticipants in both workshops and the online survey shared their support for the cotton industry moving \nforward on the issue of biodiversity protection. Nonetheless, a small subset felt that biodiversity was not a \nmajor issue for cotton growers and that some were ‘doing enough.’ It is important to note that participants \nin these activities may represent a more engaged subset of growers and consultants, and that the level of \nsupport for industry action on biodiversity may be lower in the broader cotton industry. So while many \nsupportive beliefs were shared, it is important to continue fostering a sense of importance and \nresponsibility across all growers.   \nCONSIDERATIONS WHEN CHOOSING A PRACTICE TO PROMOTE \nDiscussions in the workshops were wide-ranging and demonstrates that growers and other cotton \nprofessionals can identify benefits and barriers for all four of the practices discussed.  These discussions \ndid not reveal a ‘favourite’ practice to consider for prioritising in biodiversity management targets.  \nIn order to facilitate decisions about practice prioritisation, we apply a behavioural science lens to both the \nonline survey and workshop discussions, and provide a series of reflections to guide decision making.  \nHigh opportunity for change \nOne factor to consider in prioritising practices is identifying which practice has the lowest existing rate of \nadoption.  Such a practice has the potentially greatest capacity to elicit change.  Quantitative survey results \nshow that revegetation and regeneration practices have the lowest existing uptake.  This means that \npotentially, any effective strategy to promote greater adoption of revegetation could create change in the \ngreatest number of growers \nThe corollary of this is considering why this practice may have the lowest uptake: are there particular \nbarriers that need to be overcome when promoting this.  \nCompatibility with existing practices \nBiodiversity management practices that are compatible with existing on-farm practices and production \nneeds are more likely to be adopted.  In this case, both online surveys and workshops indicated that \nmanagement of feral animals and weed management have the strongest alignment with existing practices. \nThere are a number of potential challenges working with ‘high compatibility’ practices. As mentioned \nabove, high rates of existing uptake may limit the opportunity for change.   \n \n37 \n \nImportantly, many growers may have scope to intensify their current practices, which we recognise can be \nconducted on a spectrum of frequency or intensity. For example, existing engagement in feral \nmanagement practices could reflect high-level feral management using the latest techniques, or more \nsuperficial engagement in basic feral management. The research methods used here tried to focus \nquestions on ‘intensification of practices’, in the recognition that many growers may engage some \nmanagement practices, but that many will not have reached the ‘upper threshold’ for feral management \nopportunities on farm.  \nHowever, there are a number of challenges for promoting practices where individuals have some existing \nengagement:  \n(i) When faced with initiatives promoting the practices, individual recollection of existing \nactivities could displace consideration of new practices, and reduce the perception that change \nis required.  \n(ii) If these practices are strongly aligned with production outcomes (e.g. reducing animal impacts \non crop damage), then any attempts to extend application of these practices for biodiversity \noutcomes could be weakened if growers retain a strong emphasis on production benefits.  \nIf the industry does decide to prioritise these highly compatible ‘spectrum’ practices, we recommend that \nclear information and tools be provided to ensure that specific biodiversity targets are achieved, \nmaintained, and celebrated.  \n \n  \n\n \n38 \n \nGENERAL APPROACHES TO SUPPORT ADOPTION  \nClearly define terminology and goals. Communicate these well \nMany discussions about biodiversity indicated the potential to consider biodiversity on a number of levels \n– mainly, nature and wildlife occurring ‘separate to’ the farming system, or elements of the farming \nsystem such as soil microbiology. Such ambiguity is not only a barrier to effective communication, but \nalso can be a barrier to change: where an individual is encouraged to engage with a vague or poorly \ndefined practice, they may connect with elements of the practice that they are already doing, rather than \nseeing an opportunity for adopting new practices.  \nWhile many respondents raised concerns that many strategies to protect biodiversity are likely to have a \nnegative impact on productivity, some discussions also highlighted that some practices may generate a \nproduction benefit.  If a practice has the potential to generate a production benefit, this needs to be \ncommunicated clearly, and growers should be provided with tools to maximise this benefit.  \nProvide specific methods or tools to measure goals and gauge success \nA key driver of adoption of new practices is the perception that the practice is able to generate an expected \nbenefit.  In the context of practices to protect biodiversity, the lack of clarity about the exact nature of \nbenefits, and subsequent uncertainty about how these benefits might be assessed is likely to constrain \nadoption.  Being able to measure a benefit will also support continued engagement in new practices and \nreduce risk of dis-adoption.  \nWhen promoting new practices, it is important to provide specific examples of the types of benefits that \nthey generate, and tools that enable growers to assess the degree of benefit occurring on farm.  \nPromote observability and feedback \nMany participants highlighted the importance of being able to visualise or monitor the benefits that \nspecific practices have for biodiversity.  Much research in behavioural science and adoption highlights the \nimportance of feedback for enabling continuing performance of a practice. While feedback can take \nvarious forms, in this circumstance, if growers are able to see (directly or via monitoring reports) the \nspecific benefits attributable to new practices, this would support continuing to engage in these practices.  \nAnother opportunity to promote observability and feedback is via demonstration projects or peer-to-peer \nlearning initiatives.  Opportunities to see an initiative and its impact in real world settings that are \nmeaningful to growers is an important part of gauging the advantage of new practices. Geographically, \ndiscussions indicated that these experiences do not need to be limited to the target region to be beneficial – \nbut there are benefits to a region focus regarding local farming context and costs of travel.   \nConsider the adoption targets and audience \nFor any scheme which intends to promote new practices (or strengthening existing practices), it is \nimportant to clarify whether a scheme requires only a small number of growers, or a large proportion of \ngrowers to engage in the practice to be successful.  The type of strategy best suited to adoption will vary, \ndepending on whether a scheme is targeting a small group of growers with strong existing motivation, or \nif a broader range of growers are targeted. If widespread adoption is the target, then it is important to \nrecognise that this group will encompass growers with diverse levels of motivation, capacity and \nopportunity to adopt.  As such, it is important to consider how to make support available to diverse types \n \n39 \n \nof growers. For example small vs larger farms, different farming systems, or those with strong existing \nbiodiversity on farm vs those newly introducing biodiversity practices. If the perceived or actual equity in \nthese processes is poor, this can limit program success.  \nSPECIFIC TOOLS AND STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ADOPTION \nProvide good information and extension as part of broader approach  \nThe need for access to information and support is a key component of practice change, and the need for \ninformation and support applied to all the practices discussed.  However, it is important to recognise that \npractice change research suggests that information may be a ‘necessary but not sufficient’ ingredient to \nsupport new practices.  For those with existing motivation (as represented in many of our workshop \nparticipants), information can help overcome the threshold for change; for those without motivation or \ncapacity, information alone is unlikely to elicit change. As such, information and extension services need \nto be part of a multi-faceted approach.  \nShare stories of success \nLearning from others is an important pathway for motivating change.  Seeing how others have adopted \npractices, and sharing stories of what worked and didn’t work, is an important part of peer-to-peer \nlearning. Seeing what others have done can also strengthen social norms, which are an important influence \non action. Both of these influences were recognised in these findings, and supported by growers. This \nhighlights the importance of creating opportunities to share stories of those who have successfully adopted \nnew practices.   \nCoordinate approaches \nCoordination can potentially occur on a range of levels. Area-wide management reflects coordination of \non-ground activities within a particular region, whereas information and support services could also \nbenefit from coordination at regional or national levels. Strategies such as area-wide coordination were \nviewed as especially important for weed management and feral animal control. In addition to \nstrengthening effectiveness of weed or feral management strategies, area-wide management approaches \ncould also strengthen social norms and social pressure to engage in these practices. When area-wide \nmanagement approaches are initiated, it is important to communicate these well, as perceptions of trust \nand neighbours’ action is an important part of the process.  \nWhile success of revegetation or vegetation management initiatives were less immediately dependent on \nthe actions of one’s neighbours, there may be benefits to link these programs within area wide approaches, \nas part of broader landscape connectivity (e.g. wildlife corridors), to strengthen social norms and to share \npractices and stories of success.  \nConsider financial tools – especially when there are significant costs and \nimpacts on production \nParticipants recognised that some practices can deliver a range of productivity benefits.  Nonetheless, \nmany of these practices have the potential to incur a high cost to growers.  In addition, some practices—\nespecially certain stock exclusion and revegetation programs—require significant upfront costs and have a \nnegative impact on ongoing financial returns. There was wide-spread consensus that any initiative that \n \n40 \n \n‘actively encouraged’ or ‘required’ growers to meet certain biodiversity targets, should consider not only \nthe financial cost but ongoing impacts on returns.  \nMake it easy to apply for financial support  \nApplying for grants and engagement in other schemes often comes with a high ‘transactional cost’ related \nto the time and effort to complete applications and gather necessary information. If funding schemes are \ndeveloped or made available, ensure that these are designed to be do-able for most growers, and provide \nsupport to ensure a smooth and easy application process.  \nExplore opportunities to create innovative financial tools – biodiversity credits \nMuch discussion centred around the potential for innovative financing mechanisms—similar to carbon \ncredits and carbon farming schemes—to provide direct support for farmers engaged in biodiversity \nmanagement practices. While it is beyond the scope of the current report to review biodiversity credit \nschemes, our findings suggest that there is interest from growers in exploring these options. Many growers \nare gaining experience with carbon credit schemes, and see these as a way of the future. A system of \n‘biodiversity credits’ could strengthen both motivation and capacity for growers to dedicate time, effort or \nland to activities which would not normally contribute to production.  \nFrom a social perspective, experience with other funding mechanisms indicates that pursuing such a \nscheme for the cotton industry could consider a range of factors, such as transactional costs and equity of \naccessing such schemes, alignment with existing schemes and support systems, potential for negative \nsocial impacts, and ensuring goals and purposes are communicated effectively.  \n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \n \n \nAppendix A.

Three main sections are provided:  \n- Overall perceptions about biodiversity and biodiversity management on cotton farms \n- Perceptions about key biodiversity management practices \n- Perceptions of industry approaches to promote biodiversity \nFor each of these themes, the following tables indicate the key topic that the theme emerged within, and how frequently this issue was \nraised.  \nTOPIC   RATING  \n1 \nIncrease understanding around the meaning of \nbiodiversity \n \nA Commonly shared or raised \n2 \nNeed for knowledge and skills, monitoring, \nassessments, non-financial resources \n \nB Somewhat shared or raised \n3 \nBiodiversity occurs in whole farm context and at a \nlandscape scale and management of impacts \n \nC \nNot commonly shared or \ndifferent thinking \n4 Economic cost and value of biodiversity  \nD \nAbove/beyond common \npractice or opinion \n5 Recognition of good stewardship and practices  E Question raised \n6 Leadership opportunities for industry    \n7 Climate variability poses long-term challengers    \n \n \n  \nWhat does biodiversity mean to you? \nTOPIC \n RATING \n1 A \nWant to increase own understanding of biodiversity and how we can capitalise it and access funding to really have a good \ngo at it \n1 A Want to know what CRDC means by biodiversity - this is the purpose of the session to gain grower understanding \n1 A Would like greater awareness and understanding of what biodiversity is  \n3 A Having a look at all of the environment around you – river, wetlands, pasture, native grasses, trees, riverine areas \n3 A It is everything and the balance between all of that \n3 A Abundance of plants and creatures, they are all playing in a symphony together \n3 A Buzz word for sustainability, working within the environment, understanding whether it is natural biodiversity \n3 A Understanding how it interacts on our farm, not just the big animals, but the little bugs and don't know what is there \n3 A What do we need to do to keep biodiversity here \n3 A \nUnderstand how natural biodiversity interacts with farming biodiversity to optimise farming and achieve coherent \nproductive results \n3 A Thinking diversity of flora and fauna, and diversity of microbiology \n3 A \nRiparian and other projects focused on tyring to improve biodiversity in grazing enterprise, it is the first time we've every \nhad a discussion about biodiversity in cotton \n3 A Working with the landscape around your farms \n3 A Includes flora and fauna and how you can fit in it for the best outcome for your farm \n3 A Biodiversity is part of the natural environment \n  Biodiversity on cotton farms? \n1 A Some scepticism, not from a practical sense, but the measure of what biodiversity is and use of the word \n1 A \nDefinition of what is healthy or not, the condition rather than health, equate, some of the problem is condition and the \nquantum pressure of productivity or profitability than impacts biodiversity \n \n46 \n \n1 B \nIt is the quality of biodiversity, either in the crop, land or water, remnant or regenerated vegetation, the condition or health \nis a much more difficult thing to pin point and manage \n2 A \nLike to know what is working well, and what isn't, what is thriving and how can we protect those species that are more \nthreatened \n2 B Can't improve what we don't measure, bury your undies, wetting and drying and can have positive impact \n2 B \nWe don't know what we don't know, getting handle on issues around soil health, wasn't aware of the impact we have had on \nsoils, the focus is on inputs with little focus on soil biology \n2 A \nIt is about measurement, can't do measurement on anyone else's farm, internally tree lines are maximum 2km from a \ncentred area \n2 B Funding for more weather stations to help with spray control \n2 B \nFinding ways to make it more public knowledge and information more readily available to chemical users one way to \nimprove on biodiversity affected by off target sprays \n2 A Trying to get understanding and greener outcome in our practices \n2 B Getting plants to put in are hard to get from nurseries \n2 A Don't know a lot about it, where to get information to learn more about it and where do we go to look? \n2 A Types of species, most appropriate and works with others in the environment \n2 B \nHeavily timbered areas with big rain events hold water, areas we could be planting if we knew more about it and \nmethodology \n2 B Not a lot of native nurseries around, direct seeding needed \n3 B Need to get away from a total monoculture and having a mixture of all sorts of things \n3 A Don't really know, I get a picture of a natural theme, having a diverse range of flora and fauna and need to co-exist \n3 A \nA level of activity, I am drawn to remnant vegetation because it has an increased level of environmental activity from a \ndiverse and abundance of number of species \n3 A You can be in a cotton field and still experience a level of activity in the soil and insect life  \n3 A General level of activity, total abundance or numbers \n3 A Basic level, health of plants and levels, you can have plant and animals and not be a good indicator of biodiversity \n3 B When asked to assess biodiversity, I wouldn't have thought about it in relation to the paddock \n3 B \nOne of things we need to do better is to see the bigger picture and where our farm fits within it, we are all interconnected \nand where we fit in it \n3 A Value is beneficial insects, recruitment of insects to the monoculture, proximity to the crop is a big thing \n3 B Water quality, distance of riparian between creek and paddock is critical value for maintaining water quality \n3 B We can destroy value, dilemmas we have are around destruction of condition \n3 C \nDuring travels got to see how other countries are approaching biodiversity and are now under legislation, large bare fields \nare no longer possible, need to have shelter belts to slow movement of air and preventing erosion, benefits for biodiversity \nand disease control \n3 A How does farming interact with biodiversity  \n3 A \nMy understanding of biodiversity is everything, micro bacterial and fungi through to macro animals and what are the \nthreats, such as low variety or diversity of soil micro organisms or farming system practices that gives you good diversity \nof species \n3 B Soil ecology is really an area which is sadly lacking in the cotton industry and cropping industries in general \n3 B \nBiodiversity management is around balance, the animals comfortable carrying a number of kangaroos in diversity with \nother animals to improve \n3 A \nYou’ve got your own farm and looking at how to manage landscape for pest management, not thinking more broadly past \ntheir own farm, landscape looking at pests but not for beneficials and where are they coming from  \n3 B \nKeen to be responsible for what happens on our farm and across our neighbours, and know more about development of \nchemicals and spray control \n3 B Trees affected by defoliation, message all need to contribute to spray control \n3 A Shelter belts \n3 A Identified as sensitive areas, selectively grazed, weed control, planting, fencing off \n3 B Intensive irrigation area harder to manage remnants that are left \n3 B Companies have biodiversity blocks in the irrigation areas \n4 B For some it may not mean anything because they don’t have diverse areas on their farm \n4 B Some areas are big blank canvas, having a creek we have a head start  \n4 A From a farming point of view, productivity is always going to be number one and will come before biodiversity  \n4 B \nA lot of pressure on the business of farming, rather than worrying about the condition of something that is seen as a \nliability instead of asset \n4 A \nI see them separately, production vs biodiversity areas and waterways and corridors, think of these areas as an offset to \nproduction \n4 B Paddocks are man made biodiversity, I don't know how to bring both together or if you want to  \n4 C \nThe issue of flow between paddocks and natural areas, or lack of it, is something we are conditioned to. Valuation of \nproperty says vegetated areas only worth 5% of cleared areas, however the science supporting of the value of these areas of \nremnants and environment can contribute to the cropping and farm is established but we are not conditioned to see it \n4 C How much is a koala worth? In one way they are priceless because they are the last representation of their species \n4 B We understand there is an interaction between natural areas and production, but we use language like 'unproductive' land \n4 A Farming unproductive land costs more to farm that area, we could use it for use to another purpose to benefit the farm \n \n47 \n \n4 A Comes back to value of land, if you have a massive debt you need to do what you can to sustain it \n4 A \nIts one thing for a person to recognise the benefits, needs to be wider benefits such as creeks and beneficials that everyone \nbenefits, but you need to manage your own farm still and there is a level of independence that doesn't always align with \nbiodiversity \n4 A Carbon project, looking at where value lies in locking it up \n4 A What is the value of biodiversity, is there a financial profit to the farm \n4 B \nAll funding to biodiversity go into places that need to happen now because its so bad, or areas that have already been doing \nit for a while \n4 B \nApplied for grants, challenge that small projects are picked up but not the big projects that have large creek areas, \ndisconnect between large biodiversity areas to acknowledge in the farm, compared to small area locked up or planting trees \n4 C Biodiversity conservation trust application to lock up areas, but the area proposed was too big, but smaller projects got up \n4 B The biodiversity challenge is do we protect what we have or create new biodiversity areas \n4 A \nHow do we do both? Important thing, as a farmer, there wouldn't be anyone who isn't looking for a financial incentive, \ncan't lock it up for no return and that is the challenge \n4 A Biodiversity will fall over unless there is a financial incentive \n4 B \nTo be paid for biodiversity offering - what does this look like? Proposed to maintain the area in its natural vegetative state, \nbiodiversity officer to address weeds, pests, no wood gathering, fenced, plus small return based on locking out stock, \npreferred in perpetuity but put in 20 year plan,  \n4 B Hectare rate $50, cost more than expected for payment \n4 B Will re-stock if can't get financial incentive to maintain as natural area \n4 C Biodiversity is asleep, we don't have a charter and don't know what everyone is doing \n4 C Biodiversity outcomes driving production decisions and beneficials, trying to measure it to provide it has an outcome \n4 A Remnant is very valuable and very expensive to manage \n4 A Revegetation is expensive, needs to be well managed  \n5 A A fine balance between being conservative and letting nature do everything that it can before you step in and alter that \n5 A Lots of timber strips, monitoring it and protecting it \n5 B Have done flora and fauna surveys \n5 B \nHave a block have locked up for 15 years with surveys done, no startling results but have seen improvements from taking \ngrazing out \n5 B Old irrigation land slowly regenerating  \n5 B \nSoil health, soil biology has been decimated from grazing or cropping practices in the past, involved in project looking to \nreintroduce and re-establish beneficial biology in the landscape \n5 B Changing grazing practices seen improvements, looking at irrigation country to improve soil health \n5 C Looking at examples from around the world to improve ecology \n5 A Every farmer wants to leave the farm in a better way than they got it \n5 B Want to introduce as much biodiversity as we can \n5 B \nGrowing cover crops to protect the soil and erosion, which is helping with beneficial complex and soil microbial \nbiodiversity and helps control verticillium  \n5 D Learning how to manage diseases with biology and fungi in the soil \n5 B \nWorking with IPM and using riparian areas and tree lines for beneficials for pest management, and release beneficials in \nvegetated areas \n5 B Areas cleared of trees historically would have benefited from keeping tree lines \n5 A \nShelter breaks benefits are for drift management, break for wind to restrict movement, native vegetation for animals or \nrefuge for insects and bats etc \n5 B \nLarger farms will have increased demand for getting shelter belts and corridors through them, realise the benefits of them \nand how clearing has impacted wind and pesticide movement and prevent sand blasting impacts \n5 B \nBiosecurity has been a big thing for the insects bird and bat spectrum to analyse how much contribution they give to \ncontrol pest insects, been the focus nearly exclusively \n5 A \nStarting to look at biodiversity above and in the soil and driving crop rotation and crop decisions and how it relates to flora \nsurrounding the farm \n5 A Adjoin the Council, weed managment not conducted making it hard to control and do the right thing \n \n  Revegetation and regeneration \nTOPIC \n RATING \n    Views and experiences \n2 A Need to know what we have got and what we should be doing \n2 A Ground truth it first \n2 B Wanting to clear out area on creek but told not the touch it \n2 B Research between tree planting vs fencing areas to regenerate, exciting to see how quickly things can regenerate \n2 B What species will get past 2 decade period for survival  \n2 B It has to be such a long term vision and you to commit to it for 50 years, it is not a 5 year project \n \n48 \n \n2 C Trees in places where not naturally grown for carbon forests \n2 A Carbon is the greatest opportunity for agriculture, how can we sequester carbon into soil and be rewarded, not into trees \n2 A Work done on soil carbon sequestration and want to see more in this area from the industry \n2 B \nBurning helped to promote regeneration, more information about how to best management burning for areas and \nknowing besting conditions \n3 A Nothing since the drought \n3 B Trees on creeks have died \n3 B On the scheme, cleared and the tree scape is limited \n3 B Lost 50% trees from previous Landcare project years ago \n3 A Dry years can really impact on best intentions \n3 C The natural condition has been disrupted to the extent it is hard to find areas to work on  \n3 B Focus on existing natural areas, revegetation is impractical with irrigation around the place \n3 B The negative impact the extent of dry has had on native veg and amenity of the farm \n3 A Tree planting can be a lot of work but succumb to drought \n3 B On a landscape that is very dry, tree planting is not part of our thinking, focus on regeneration \n3 C Journals of Sturt and Mitchell, more trees now, previously open grasslands \n3 A Haven't done to much other than fencing and weed control \n3 B \nRevegetating to close to the river causes issues during flood, want to pick areas for a wildlife corridor rather than blanket \ntree planting \n3 A Greater diversity, getting everything to live is the challenge and establish the species that will grow \n3 B \nMix around five species of trees and shrubs based on local seed and soil types, trees outgrew the shrubs, three lines of \ntrees along the riverine corridors and split farm into units and connect farm with riverine areas \n3 B People have planted trees, people concerned growing trees with defoliation and tree corridor impacts \n3 B Reseeding for revegetation for regeneration of area, waiting for right conditions to take off \n3 C Running surge water off through bushland, helped it take off \n3 B Natural areas should be able to regeneration with out reseeding \n3 B \nRedgum forest suckers taking over after wet years, about a balance and area wide management and regional view instead \nof doing it on own \n4 B We know there is a value on it, but it is a value on paper \n4 A \nManaging for weeds and loss of productive area, set cost every year and loss of income such as cropping which adds up \nover years and significant financial impact \n4 A \nDesire to create a sustainable landscape, way to offset some of the cost is how we see it working going forward which is \nwhy we are interested in the carbon, we know there will be increased biodiversity but it is without financial return \n4 B Carbon projects regular flow benefits, during drought when grazing  \n4 A Fitting around revegetation with infrastructure, designing new developments to include tree lines and is a big cost \n5 A Small area revegetated \n5 A Effort is making sure they live \n5 B Motivation to plant, habitat is more sustainable if there are corridors \n5 B I'm a bit of a greenie \n5 C Never were trees on the creek, a few old ones, young ones coming back \n5 A Have been planting some corridors and paths \n5 A Looking at tree planting, but water is limited \n5 B \nPockets of vegetation left, used to be burned but now removed burning regime due to neighbours not burning and have a \nlush area \n5 C \nStrips on farms for insects in Europe, strip of wildflowers for beneficial insects to thrive resulting in 2 less insecticide \nsprays \n5 B All farming, areas of grazing and dryland as well as irrigation.  \n5 B Farming can put back to grass, can see where that needs to happen \n5 B There is a good system of corridors \n5 B Focus on areas where we take water from the river, and care to manage vegetation in areas to access the river \n5 B \nLegacy of dryland cropping, have dropped out poor areas and return to grass in spectacular period of time in good \nconditions \n5 B General rule with staff that only feral animals are shot/culled to not have a negative impact on native animals on the farm \n5 A \nSpoken about with carbon farming, growers are asking the question can we do this in country that is not productive and \noffset the cost and ongoing cost of managing regen area \n5 B Entire focus of grazing operation is regeneration, don't focus on animals, focus on grass and landscape health \n5 B \nPreviously involved in significant tree planting program, but big company had situation where they could water during \ndrought \n    Strengthen practices? \n2 B A lot of tools out there at the moment for grazing, about controlling numbers myGrazing \n2 B Assessment done on old cotton country, very slow regeneration \n2 B Barriers are legislation, what is it and what we can and can't do \n2 B Can’t get access to stock to plant \n2 B Case studies on revegetation and nature strips and spray drift management \n \n49 \n \n2 C Fast tracking tools to calibrate impacts on soil carbon and investment in technology to measure using desk top assessments \n2 B Getting access to tools, better understanding impacts to soil carbon \n2 A Having information about where to plant and small steps to take \n2 A Knowing if you get it right, what do we do and positive and negative impact \n2 A Knowing what can do, know limitation \n2 B Not doing anything in case you have a negative impact \n2 B Recipe or guide book and funding for fencing, willing to pay but costs over a long period of time \n2 A Would do what is recommended, to encourage habitat through retention or regeneration \n3 B Add vegetation spots on farm where can \n3 B Brolgas can do a lot of damage on farm during the dry \n3 B Council weed officers don't have many options for roadside control, slashing and chemical \n3 B Don't see a lot of overlap with cotton and grazing business, new area of work to look at regenerative ag and cotton systems \n3 B How can it be made better if we can't touch it \n3 B Lots of micro bats on farm, trying to ensure they have access to water \n3 B Planted native trees, big exercise and need to be interested in it to do it \n3 B Revegetation by direct seeding, mixed results \n3 B Slash roadways, have finches and have an area we don't slash to ensure they have cover \n3 B Synergy between cotton and grazing would be through soil biology \n4 B \nFarming practices working towards with all growers is improving in field biodiversity to foster a sustainable farming \nsystem and seeing a financial gain which is a significant driver, different biodiversity infield and other natural areas which \nis why people are investing in filed because the financial return is higher \n4 B Fixing an environmental problem vs development limitation  \n4 B If don't have a vested interest in environment it is financial \n4 A \nNatural vege and biodiversity and productive biodiversity, infield will see the economic reward much areas, just won't see \neconomic return from natural areas \n4 B Run cotton and other areas as two separate businesses \n4 A Want an economic return, don't want it costing us money every year to manage it for public good \n4 A Where is bang for buck, best planting to do \n5 C Compost to improve soil biology and how to get into cotton areas \n5 C Desilting hole back to original depth and natural state, work on being able to this \n5 B Part of the biodiversity is farming practices, changing biodiversity in micro level in the soil to improve productivity areas \n5 B \nTook some areas back to natural landscape, took a fortune to do it, hard for stock and couldn't crop it and in the future \nmight be worth something as carbon \n6 B Lack of input, management and control from LLS \n6 A Regional view needs to be coordinated \n3 B Some growers are happy to do the easy options such as plant trees \n3 A Hard in flooded areas to plant trees \n4 A Don't know how to put value on riparian areas such as beneficials and put a monetary value on it \n4 A Dollar factor \n4 A Incentive gets people over the line \n4 B Incentive BCI BMP premium for biodiversity management \n6 A Publicity and warm fuzzy feeling for the public, we just do it, but outside people think it is great \n4 C \nCotton as a clothing product, this is our point of different, cotton can make a positive contribution to the environment, \njump on before it is green washed \n4 C Trading house to capitalise on it \n4 C Kangaroo and koala photos on products \n    Motivate to strengthen practices? \n1 A More funding and awareness on carbon farming important to do more \n1 B Haven't looked a biodiversity credits, but carbon because it is important for the future \n1 B \npeople more than happy to move back to natural state if it they are no longer able to make a return, financial incentive vs \nlack of return,  \n2 B Prove it works, beneficials living in shelter belts will reduce the number of sprays \n2 A Learning process, such as birds and bats have an impact too \n2 A Better understand when beneficials will work or wont work \n3 B \nCan't farm to the river, taking 40m off river bank wont change production area, using riverine areas and native recruitment \nand tree lines in the grazing areas \n3 B Fits in mixed farm well, full irrigation lateral systems costs a lot to move or change for tree lines \n4 B can't put a value on it and left it to grow back to natural scrub \n4 B Don't want to lock it up because don’t know what value it has in the future \n4 A \nMarket for cotton with no sprays and premium for it, potential cost is losing yield needs to be offset with sustainability \nreturn \n4 B Hard to justify taking production land out of production to plant shade lines, prepared a little bit, but need to see a return \n4 C In areas of the cattle industry, if you dedicate 10% to corridors it directly corresponds to 10% improved production \n4 A It is not easy to analyse, but need the demonstration and measure of benefit and cost benefit \n \n50 \n \n4 B Time, money, motivation - not at top of priority list \n    Help or Solutions? \n2 A \nAssistance to demonstrate what can do and design, benefits of what to put where and define what the outcome is and trying \nto achieve against a vision \n2 B Big on demonstration sites and case studies, people are doing things differently to high input agriculture using biology \n2 B Challenges gets back to value in our current system, can't value these resources and their function properly \n2 A Consultant to look at whole farm plan, management plan over 5 years best plan of attack and advise better on practices \n2 A Getting a good look at alternative ways of doing things and demonstrating that \n2 B Have a plan to measure, issues and how to address it with options \n2 A how many bats does it take to control insects, we don’t talk about these benefits in IPM \n2 A How to measure biodiversity? Need to know it is being looked after.  \n2 A Kept it basic and recipe to encourage what to do would be a good starting point \n2 A Need to know a lot more about what species need, what is there and what they need to thrive \n2 B \nReally can't improve what we can't measure, done some testing and was expensive but didn't understand what was saying \n(soil) \n2 C Salinity from cleared areas and water table rising, advice to manage it \n3 A Doing things now, how to do it in an enduring way and will take a long time to fix \n3 B Few of us are having saline issues, encouraged to put trees back, opening there that it could help cropping \n3 C I was destroying the landscape, not improving it, and I didn't know that \n3 C In France, look at IMP and whole region biodiversity and address disruption chemistry has done \n3 B It has to be whole of, not piece by piece, takes a lot of cooperation \n3 B Know it is not going to happen overnight or get results quickly \n3 B Left black wattle because they have survived through the drought when eucalypts haven't \n3 B \nPeople see black wattle as a weed, but it is only a weed because it comes in after disturbance, it is a legume and fixes \nnitrogen for the next generation of vegetation \n3 B Trees around during the drought is a bit of a mental boost \n3 B Working with neighbours and what they have got \n4 B All the focus is on tree planting, but how to we fund those that already have passed stage one and improve biodiversity \n4 A \nBiodiversity funding really interesting, funding is about tree planting and regeneration, but interesting that old growth is \nnot valued, will take a long time for tree planting to achieve the value that 20 year trees already have, agree with zoning \n4 A Cost of maintenance over a five year period to establish, especially during drought where there was only 30% survival \n4 B \nCredit points for cotton industry, there are answers, can control pest insects through IPM but what is the incentive to \nmanage it \n4 A \nDepending on the incentive, could be game changing if value is placed on the area and put a return from it, people are \ngoing to want to do it \n4 A Doing a portion of our selves, assistance would speed it up \n4 A Ecosystem services and wind protection value of native vegetation strips \n4 B Gowers would welcome assistance and support to do things in the pipeline, not for every grower \n4 A \nHappy to set aside areas that are not suitable for farming, cost is a big part of what needs to be done, if there is carbon \ncredit scheme for ongoing management would help that to occur \n4 B \nIf the country is costing more, such as flooding and constantly doing soil works and not as productive for farming, if \nfunded to turn it back to native vegetation and give financial incentive to manage it properly and offsetting the cost of \nmanagement such as weeds etc \n4 A Lock up land, depends on returns, sometime unpractical to put boundaries on what can and cant' do \n4 B \nLooking at the big picture of climate change, look at different ways, it is treated as a crop for ongoing benefit, not just the \ncost of planting but has to be something ongoing so there is a return on the land we have as a bigger picture for all farmers \n- monetary incentive instead of just losses \n4 B \nManagement fees to improve the country or maintain it at the same level, expert classes land based on diversity and putting \nvalue on country, if they are improving the class of country they need to be incentivise  \n4 A \nMonetary incentive to offset cost to managing area, so you are no longer losing money as it is costing money of low \nproductive area to manage \n4 A Need to be looking at things differently, old trees and been there a long time should be valued different than tree planting \n4 A Primary producers have to carry the farm for the community, wearing the cost but sharing the benefits \n4 A Program cost, time, resources - maybe 50% costs \n4 B \nPublic good on riverine area planting, controlling weeds, water quality, fish breeding and public funding comes into play to \noffset costs for beneficial outcomes \n4 A Question is about how to help with the cost \n4 A \nThe ground that makes money vs ground for natural areas, shift in income may increase value and area for tree corridors \netc \n4 B Threatened species are hanging on in the older areas and areas not cleared and left, those areas are the most valuable \n4 A \nTime and money, interest if know other neighbours would meet consultant to get advice and target to make improvement \nand have unified approach \n4 B \nTwo fold biodiversity -

Quotes from workshops \n \n \n \nThe following sections highlight key quotes from the workshops that correspond to the results sections \nabove.  \nPerceptions about the term biodiversity \nBiodiversity is ‘the natural environment’ \nIt's really just having a look at all of the environment that you've got around you. So whether \nit's river , wetlands, whether it's pasture, native grasses, trees… it's looking at the whole \nenvironment that you've got around you and working with it. \nbiodiversity is just part of the natural environment. \nBiodiversity is not just all the plants and animals, it’s the little things too, and how they \ninteract \nI'd say an abundance of plants and creatures and you know, that’re all playing in a symphony \ntogether. \nfor me it's more understanding what's out there and how it interacts with each other, and how \nit works on our farms ... Especially the little things like the bugs and the small things. We don't \nknow what's there - so, learning about what's here and what you need to do to, to keep what’s \nhere here \nSome participants viewed soil microorganisms and parts of cropping systems as part of \nbiodiversity by some, but not all participants came to the discussions with this view.  \nThose microorganisms that are in there, the fungus bacteria - they will help us grow better \ncrops if we've got healthier soil. And so that is to me, part of the biodiversity of our farming \npractices, changing the biodiversity in our soils on a very micro level. So for me, we most \ndefinitely have two separate areas - We've got our natural veg biodiversity and we've got our \nfarming country, productive economic biodiversity. We need both \nI would have just thought if you were asking me to assess biodiversity in a farm we've been in \na farm we’ve been in now, I wouldn't have thought about it in relation to what the paddock, I \nwould have thought about it in relation to the other areas of the farm so ... I saw them \nseparately, which is probably needs to be a shift in thinking, really. \nThen yeah, you're working on yeah, your paddocks where you’re farming is , I guess it's \nbiodiversity, isn't it, but it's a, it's a man-made biodiversity, it’s a different system altogether \nThe vagueness of the term biodiversity, and the different ways it could be inte rpreted was a barrier to engaging with \nthe topic. In particular, some people found it a bit ‘jargony’ \n…a bit of a buzzword, like sustainability … what biodiversity [do] you really want? ... I’d like \nto increase my understanding of biodiversity and how we can capitalize on it within our \nfarming system. \nI'm probably at a basic level as well … you can have plants and animals, and that not be a \ngood indicator of biodiversity. …I guess to be honest [I have] some scepticism around \nbiodiversity \n \n62 \n \nIf I went in and tried to map my biodiversity, I wouldn't know where to start, or wouldn't know \nwho to ask. \nParticipants felt that if the cotton industry was going to more involved in biodiversity \nmanagement, then they need to develop clear definitions and clear goals with regard to what \nthey were trying to achieve.  \nI think biodiversity’s asleep. I don’t think there’s a real charter, as to what we're all trying to \nachieve. Because none of us really understand the true meaning of it or will have a different \nmeaning. And I guess that's why I wonder where CRDC are going with the \nbiodiversity...Whether they are looking for big native vegetation stuff, or whether they're \nlooking for the more small scale in field, diversity of small species \nI think the biodiversity challenge is - Are we looking after existing biodiversity or are we \ntrying to replant, Build biodiversity? And I think that that's the challenge. And for us, are \nCRDC looking to increase biodiversity on cotton farm? Or are they looking to promote the \nones where it already is? \nTo have a clear vision, definition, picture of what they are promoting as biodiversity, because, \nobviously, even from this call, there are varied opinions on what that is. So, I would think \nCRDC need to be pretty clear as to what biodiversity… encompasses \nAnd, so, there is this kind of way that we can contribute to shaping things for the sector. There \nis recognition that we have to, you know, we ultimately have to do something about these \nthings, or we may not survive. …what the things that we're talking about mind, you know, \nthey're challenging, but they also may very opportunities for the future, So, we have this \nopportunity to lead again \nI agree, it’s all about social licence. I Think long term benefits will come from biodiversity \nenhancement. \nYeah, that's where we've got to get to, and I think our, one of the best, yeah, the most focused \nthings we could do is, it's crack that leadership opportunity. \n…if it [biodiversity protection] is not something that's a priority, we do have that risk that t he \nindustry does come under fire, because it's not something that we're addressing enough… \nYeah, I do think I see it as something really beneficial for our industry \nMotivations to do the ‘right thing’ \nevery farmer wants to leave their land in better shape than what they found it and, you know, if \nI had a dollar for every time that I’d heard that we’d be doing a lot better than we’re doing.  \nI know that every farmer I’ve talked to wants to leave the land in a better way than they found \nit. There is, that approach on a family farm might be different to leasing country so that’s a \nthing to consider but, yeah, in general, I think we all want to do, do the right thing and \nintroduce biodiversity wherever we can. \nI would like to do something for smaller birds, some sort of different species of trees, or \nwhatever to encourage them \n… what he was saying earlier, you know, people need to have a vision for it  \nSome inherent value for biodiversity: we've got a problem on our farm at the moment - Well, \nit's not a problem. It's, it's, it's actually really interesting, but it's an old billabong area that \nwas hooked up through the cotton channel, into our farm. And it's got a endangered species \nliving in it that no one can find it anywhere else at the moment. So we're working with the DPI \non that. But it's, it's a little bit yes, it's in our cotton fields, its this little snail, and, and we have \nto look after him. So, yeah, you know, we sort of recognize that. You know, we have to look \nafter these areas as well. Yeah, so it's just a balance \n \nRevegetation \nMotivating factors –benefits for productivity \n \nTrees supporting productivity \n \n63 \n \nWe're pushing up to 400% increase in productivity underneath old coolabah trees across our \nlandscape, that's phenomenal. \nOne thing, I would like add is the change in my view around trees. I would go out to people's \nfarms … and the only good tree was one that was that was burnt in the corner of the paddock. \nSince we've changed our grazing practices here, what we've started to see is our most \nproductive land is under our trees, so that's, that's a pretty significant change.  \nYou know there’s does research in the cattle industry up on the tablelands, where if you put \n10% of the land down to tree lines you actually gain that exactly the same amount of \nproductivity back and the cattle are warmer, grow better and there’s less liquid in the plants. \nSo there's actual data and studies around that. We're yet to have that in our arena here. So it's \nidentifying how you get a return out of it.  \nHabitat supporting beneficial insects and natural pest management \n[re promoting insects] It was really common throughout Europe to have..., to do a strip of wild \nflowers were attractive to beneficial insects, and they were doing that along each field  to try \nand promote benefits of moving into that particular area, that wasn't touched throughout the \nseason.  [Did they see results from that?] Yes. There was  less insecticide sprays in those \nfields. \nI think that the language around the benefits of what things like your birds, bats =  are doing \non farm, you know, eating their own weight in insects, if we can provide that habitat and then \nsort of, I guess how many bats does it take to control this many insects,  providing through \nextension some of the. The tangible outcomes of these, these wildlife on your farm, would be \ncertainly be helpful at the moment. \nHaving this bank of beneficial insects and birds living in that tree line over there that saves me \nputting on $50 per hectare sprays and insecticide, that adds up every day of the week \nMotivating factors - Seeing the benefits  \nthe further we get into it, the more species we start to see returning, things that, you know, we \nhave mate of ours who’s been doing this longer than us, you know they’re seeing spec ies their \nmother hadn't seen for decades, and suddenly they start to see grasses, returning that, this \nlady, hadn’t seen since she was a kid or something, you know, that's, that's really encouraging  \nThere’s a strip - I've currently got a whole heap of Zebra finches. I'm just, I've got quite a long \nstrip that we're not slashing so that they've got somewhere to hide – they’re in the chickpeas,  \nthey’re just everywhere, I've never seen so many Zebra finches before in my life, so it's pretty \nexciting to see. So I'm just sort of trying to be aware of the areas that we do slash and make \nsure that they've got some cover around. \nYeah, we've got pockets that we've just left. they used to be burnt semi regularly and we've now \ntaken the burning program out of that particular area cause one of our neighbours has an \narea that's never been burnt and it's, it's really quite lush, and it's, you know, come back really \nwell. \nI do think that most farmers have got a bit of interest in native vegetation trees in general \naround here \nTo some it actually means nothing to them, because they don't have anything on farm to really \nbe worried about, like, the only trees they’ve got are around the house, the only lawn that \nthey've got or any sort of pasture might be around the sheds or the back of the sheds. \n…there was [another] farm with very little biodiversity around, that gave us an opportunity to \nsee the difference between that farm and the other farm and there was some difference.  \nChallenges - financial costs \njust an example, a budget for 3.7 kms of trees on the, and get them through for five years to \nkeep them alive and growing, is about $50 000      \nSo there’s just the budget for doing that. It's not necessarily a cheap exercise, especially, it's \nnot just plant a tree, you gotta keep alive, water them, spray around them, all of that stuff. So, \nit's, it's not a cheap project \nevery minute of the day, your time's worth something, and all your employees, you’re paying \nthem – they don’t go home saying oh, don't pay me only for the second half, because we've \nbeen planting trees You know, that, every minute of every day, for every machine, and every \n \n64 \n \nunit of labour it costs money - That's as a business owner. That's the first thing across my \nmind. Anytime we look at anything, that's, what's it gonna cost? \n… I would be losing income…  it's no longer productive on your farm and landscape and just \ncosting you money to manage ... there has to be something ongoing, I think, so, a return on \nthat land that we have. \nwe've got a large stretch of the creek...  it's absolutely beautiful… I'd love to bring the river \nback a bit, you know, reclaim some of this wheat country. But every time it comes back to \ndollars, and at the end of the day, it's a farm, and it needs to make money, Yeah, his quick \nanswer is, ‘when is the government going to pay us to grow trees, the same sort of money as \nwe can out of wheat.' So, I think, at the end of the day, we have these beautiful areas of land \nbut they are also farms, and when you're borrowing money to buy farms and things, they have \nto be profitable \nthe area is good cropping area. So, a major cash incentive I guess [to not use for biodiversity]  \nWe want an economic return on what we do, we don't want it to be costing us money, every \nyear to be doing it just to make somebody feel better about it \nAnd they’re quite happy to plant trees and do the easy options because it's funded for them but \nif you actually asked them I would confidently say that if you actually asked them to go and \nplant those trees and pay for those trees they probably wouldn't do it. \nBecause, you're asking people to spend money. Which, obviously, we know that there's gains \nfor an increase in biodiversity on farms and sort of stuff. But, you’re asking an outlay of costs \nwith no dollar return, which ultimately is a business like anything else. That ends up being the \ndriver for a lot of growers \n[on funding and labour force] I feel like those opportunities of sort of dried up bit, unless I'm \njust not looking in the right spots. It seemed like Lls and landcare have invested more in \npeople we’d be happy to do tree planting and things like that but to me, it seems like by the \ntime you find a grant they are only open for 5 or 6 weeks and we'll miss a deadline and then, \num, once again, if you don't have the labour to do the planting and things like that, it would be \ngreat to see some collaboration with the people who are looking for work  \nit's very hard to, you know, put 50 or $60,000 into a program. Um, so, uh, Like some guys, just \nbecause they’re not in a financial situation, they probably not in a position to do it. \nWe are actually planning to put in tree lines but you can imagine there's some big costs…  \nSo there’s just the budget for doing that. It's not necessarily a cheap exercise, especially, it's \nnot just plant a tree, you gotta keep alive, water them, spray around them, all of that stuff. So, \nit's, it's not a cheap project  \nChallenge – impacts on productivity \n \nYou can, you know, put country back to grass, and you can see where that needs to happen. \nBut, again, it comes down to, back to productivity., \nfrom a farming point of view, productivity is going to be the number one....Productivity is \ngoing to come before biodiversity still I don't know if that's the right thing, but I thi nk that's \nprobably the normal thing for most, most farmers. \nChallenge – Benefits accrue over long time periods  \nA lot of it’s how they’re structured financially as well, guys that probably have  just struggled \nthrough the drought, so it's very hard to, you know, put 50 or $60,000 into a program that's \ngoing not to don't give you any return for at least 10 years or see any benefit for probably 10 \nyears or more. Like some guys, just because they’re not in a financial situation, they probably \nnot in a position to do it. \nin field, we're going to see the rewards economically much faster. We're not necessarily going \nsee that in our feel-good areas. Oh, we love them— but we're not getting an economic return \nfrom them \nWhat did I actually try to achieve in the first place, and to know that it's not going to happen \novernight  You're not going to get results quickly, But I imagine that through the drought, you \nknow, like, I know you'd like to have trees around, it probably gives a bit of a mental boost \nwhen you've got trees around. \n \n65 \n \nIt's really hard, it's got to be a long-term vision. You’ve really got to commit to it for 50 years, \nyou know, like, it's, it's not a five-year project. \nacacia takes probably 20 to 30 years to go through that cycle. So we are locking up a bit of \nland to recreate a remnant. And black wattle takes over and everyone, in the business goes \nlook what you've done – you’ve just created all this weed but it’s not for us, It's for the kids in \nprimary school now, to get the benefit of, one day down the track. \nto implement that's going not to don't give you any return for at least 10 years or see any \nbenefit for probably 10 years or more. \nand to know that it's not going to happen overnight  You're not going to get results quickly \nChallenge- revegetation is not simple, conceptually or in practice \n \nDifficulty accessing plant stock \nactually getting plants to plant, there’s hardly any nurseries, you can't get the plants an d \nthings like that - so that's difficult …  \nI agree… there’s not a lot of native, um, plant nurseries around it seems to have gone more \ninto direct seeding \nAnd, as I said before, you might want to but you can’t, find access to -  I'm trying to find some \nsalt bushes at the moment, it's totally impossible. \nEstablishing trees is difficult \nThe trick is getting everything to live, especially when you've got a hostile environment of no \ntrees there already, sometimes you’ve just got to establish the species that will run. The second \nthing is, it's really hard to go back and replant or thicken or increase the diversity of a tree \nplot that’s there because a lot of the moisture gets taken by the crops that are there. If you \nhave a tree die it's actually quite hard to get another one to live in that spot. because all of the \nsurrounding trees take all of the moisture and there's a lot of competition for light and \neverything \nEncouraging tree growth was not always a straightforward process:  \n… that's really promoted that natural bush to come along throughout the farming operation. \nand helps with the wildlife. But it struggles to take off unless you burn some of it. The new \ntrees can’t regenerate because of the ground cover. We’ve had the odd lightning strike, but it's \njust understanding the time when to burn or how to manage that undergrowth to promote that \nnatural revegetation \nRevegetation is more complex than just trees \n and things that look really good – like planting trees looks fabulous.  But if we were to plant \nseeds, it's actually more beneficial. And we’re more likely to have survivorship through \nplanting seeds, than to plant saplings \nI'm really convinced that when we look at plants that germinate following events, it's very \nmuch to do with, you know, the dominance of either fungi or bacteria in our soils and, \nunfortunately, we haven’t got too much of either….  you know when you start seeing grasses \nthen we start to see better fungal numbers, so we're really focused, I guess, on how we can \nregenerate some our country through getting particularly fungi back into our soils \nThat's, that's, it's, it's a whole new, it's a whole new area of work at the moment in looking at \nregenerative ag and cotton systems. But, you know, it's about, I guess it’s about healthy \nbiology. \nI guess one of the things that, back on the soil health stuff..  we feel that soil biology’s \nbasically been decimated, whether it's through grazing practices or through our farming \npractices in the past, we feel that we've got very small quantities of soil biology and poor soil \necology … We've changed our grazing practices over the years to go from traditional set stock \ngrazing to time control grazing, so rest and recovery, is a big part of our program. So now we \nknow we spent a lot of return of perennial grasses, shrubs back into the landscape. \nYeah, that's the entire focus of our grazing operation is around regeneration. You know, we \nknow that the capacity of a landscape today is nowhere near what it was once and you know, \nman made it what it is today and we're making the assumption that man can  turn that around \nand so, you know, yeah, our focus is around you know, we no longer focus on animals. we \n \n66 \n \nfocus on grass and when make all our decisions based on the grass or the landscape health, as \nopposed to animals. \nChallenge – lack of information or knowledge \nI need to know a lot more about what different species need. I don't know enough about what's \nthere and what it needs to stay there, and what it needs to thrive. \nI think sometimes we don't know what to do, - we do something that can have a negative \nimpact \nChallenges - Alignment to farm systems and geography \n \nFinding opportunity and space for revegetation projects \nYeah, I think probably the bigger the farmers are the more likely they are to do something, \nrather than the smaller farmer. … the larger the farm they might have more area that they can \ndo that. It's probably a little bit harder for the smaller farm. \nI’ve been trying to increase the amount of shrubbery underneath power lines that are quite \nlow, …there's not a lot of space to plant trees—that would take out really high, productive sort \nof parts of the farm. So I'm looking at spots where I can add some vegetation and not sort of \nimpact negatively on the field… \nHard to access certain areas \nit's hard to get access and hard to manage those areas and, and to even know where to start \nwith, sort of, I guess, getting rid of some species and encouraging others. \n...Revegetation, and that kind of thing is, is, to large extent impractical when you’ve got \nirrigation infrastructure around the place, \nUm, it's predominantly now availability, fitting it around the farming infrastructure that's \nthere… \nDrought and water scarcity \nwe're on a landscape that is very dry and so, tree planting is not something that's been part of \nour thinking. [So] our regeneration is all around controlling our grazing pressure. \nThe trick is getting everything to live …sometimes the you’ve just to establish the species that \nwill run. If you have a tree die it's actually quite hard to get another one to live in that spot. \nbecause all of the surrounding trees take all of the moisture \nAnd we've been trying to be involved with some biodiversity projects for the last five years. \nAnd water has been quite limited...we've got some wildlife corridors. And we've lost probably \n50% of the trees within those areas. They're quite hard to get water to, just with that low \nrainfall. So I'm trying to work out how to work with [our local NRM group] and sort of look at \nwhat trees are actually suitable for the region that will get past that two decade perio d and \ncope in those really hot, extended dry periods  \nFlood \nit's really hard to manage those river areas particularly with revegetating too close to the river \nbecause of flood coming through \nChallenges - Benefits undermined by secondary impacts on weeds, pests, or feral animals \nYeah, the only thing you'd do is enhance the remnant with the understory. \nbut what happens now when the water recedes, we'll have all the weeds from everywhere to \ncontend with and that's an issue river country is known for \nI don't know that there's a great deal more that we could do apart from linking up those \nwaterholes which would have been in a corridor for small creatures and whatnot. But there's \nsort of not much point to doing that if we've got a feral pig problem, that's, you know, that sort \nof negating anything positive in terms of making it a nice environment or making a habitable \nenvironment for smaller critters. \nif we leave country uncultivated, especially near the river, but generally speaking the \npioneering species will, will, um, colonize immediately and often they’re weeds. \nSo, we described him as a weeds. \n \n67 \n \n sometimes we do things that do have that secondary impact, and because someone's trying to \nsolve a solution, I witnessed just the multi species cover cropping. And it was a regulated thing \n… and they had a list of 20 species that are allowed to put in there, and they're actually \nbridging pest insects into their next following crop. \nChallenge – supporting revegetation vs protecting existing vegetation \nThis is where we've found biodiversity funding, really interesting and all the projects that come \nout about regeneration and tree planting, which is fabulous, I have no issues with that, but I \nfind it really interesting that people don't seem to value even trees that are say 30 years old \ndon't get the value..  But I would just be a bit wary about always funding the new stuff, and not \nrewarding or acknowledging the old stuff as well \nStrategies - Financial mechanisms \n… the other underlying one is funding, isn't it? If we want to go fence all these areas off or if \nwe to go and plant trees, it’s who's paying for that and we’re willing to pay but it’s just if \nwe’re paying it's over a longer period of time.  \nI guess it's something that's been spoken about quite heavily as the whole carbon farming \nInitiative has sort of taken off in the last few years. So growers are asking the question, is there \na way that we can offset the cost of doing this in country that's currently not productive ... It's \ndefinitely a desire to create sustainable landscape, but I think finding a way in which we can \noffset some of the cost \nI think that carbon is the greatest opportunity that agriculture has ever seen, and I think it’ll \nbe the greatest opportunity that I’ll see in my farming lifetime To me, it just, it just, it all sets \nup and it's about how can we sequester carbon back into our soils how can we be rewarded for \nthat? So I don't see sequestering carbon in trees as being the future, it's, it's about how we can \nsequester carbon in soils, and I've been really disappointed that I'm not sort of seeing more \nenergy from the cotton industry in how we can sequester carbon in soils because there was \nsome work done by Rocky, that sort of gave some pretty encouraging indications that we can \nsequester carbon in cotton soils.  \nBUT certain schemes (such as carbon farming) could have negative social impacts:  \nit shouldn't have negative socio economic impacts on the community \nI guess that’s my point, so we don't want biodiversity to head that way … locking up country \npurely for the grant or reward. \nStrategies – information, education, extension  \n \nInformation about what species to plant and where, and how to maintain them  \nin the first instance, gaining information about where to look and how to learn more about it. \nI'm not sure -Is it as simple as, do you guys have comprehensive information on your websites? \n… If we learnt more about what would be the most appropriate types of things, to be planting, \nor to the population per hectare. what sort of rates? What sort of methodology? Yeah. To be \nable to learn more about that, would be an advantage \nFor me, I, I think I need to know a lot more about what different species need, to start with. I \njust don't know enough about what's there and what it needs to stay the re, and what it needs to \nthrive \nFirst of all, as I said before, we really need to know what we've got there and what, what we \nshould be doing to make that better, or sustain it, or whatever. So we probably need to ground \ntruth first I reckon \nAnd really where we're the bang for buck is going to be, I’d love to plant these trees but I want \nthem to be the right ones that are going to really make more of an impact. \n[advice] Well, I guess it would be based on what is actually recommended, what is the best \nbiodiversity and nature strips to have or revegetation, like, what are we encouraged to plant? \nAnd, and we'd look to go and do that or strengthen the existing strips   \nI actually think there is a bit of a lack of knowledge…I was surprised, we had a drone tree \nplanting field day, did everything and two neighbours, they tell us they’ve never seen how we \nplant a tree, which I thought was a pretty common thing, with the land care around the \ndistrict. So there's potentially a lack of knowledge to make a start out ther e. It really surprised \nme, you know we’ve had lots of discussions about insects and tree lines and everything over \n \n68 \n \nthe years but the question they asked me was, well how do you get a tree to live? And so that \nsurprised me a bit, so there's potentially a lack of knowledge there \nInformation about benefits \nI think that’d probably drive a few them. If they saw that they saw that you know I’ve got less \nthan 2% of trees on my farms and there’s a bit of knowledge around that more trees will help \nwith beneficial insects and everything. Certainly I think there'd be some interest there.  \nYou know, there's just a big gap of information about the soil health, and how can we manage \nit going forward? What are the best things to do, like the information if it's there, it's  not \ngetting to the growers. \nInformation about getting started and navigating systems \nI reckon that idea of a bit of a recipe or a guide book would be, would be great  \nI think if you, it’s not going to happen overnight, but if we kept it basic and there wa s a recipe \nalmost to encourage us what to do that would be a starting point \nBut I think it's more, knowing what people can do, knowing their limitations, and knowing \nwhere to go to get help, because I think that is half the struggle, that's half the issue,  we just \ndon't know what we can do, what we're able to do, that sort of thing.  \nI think some of the barriers is probably legislation, so not really knowing what the legislation \nis, and what's allowed to happen and I suppose, the restrictions of those legis lations, so I think \nthat's a big thing that we need to work out, what people can and can't do.  \nMeasurement tools & support \nSome of it, too, is about knowing if you get it right. What are we trying to do? Is it actually a \npositive or a negative impact \nMaybe you can get a self assessment template, or document where a grower can go and do \nyour own self assessment. Then, you know, whether you do a ranking or rating I don’t know.  \nI suppose if you could get yourself a self assessment and see exactly where you a re that might \ndrive a few of them  \nDemonstrates sites / learn from others \nI guess, I'm big on demonstration, we need case studies. There are people that are starting to \ndo things very differently to traditional high input agriculture and just really encour aging \nstuff, You know, there’s guys in New Mexico in in the US that, you know, are growing high \nyielding cotton crops on predominantly biology. And, so, you know, we need to be able to \ndemonstrate it because, you know, I felt I was always doing the right thing, you know, we're \ntrying to leave our landscape in better shape to the next generation well you know it's pretty \nbloody clear to me that I've been destroying the landscape, not improving it.  \nProvide flexible entry points \nPeople basically want to try things within their sphere. I wouldn't discount just running some \nmore simplified workshops.  \n… that takes a lot of commitment and co-operation. Sometimes, I think we try to put, put it \nacross as … It just becomes overwhelming, because it's too much, like, whether we can bring it \nback to just a bit at a time, you know, things that are manageable, and, and have those if \npeople start having those small wins and then the benefit from just one thing. Not trying to do \n[everything] at once, or, you know, just to in manageable sizes that, yeah, that aren't \noverwhelming in amongst everything else that people have got going on in their life  \nwe would like to pick some areas where we would have a like a wildlife corridor or something \nlike that and promote that that rather than sort of blanket tree planting or shrubs or anything \nlike that. \nStock exclusion from riparian and riverine areas \nMotivating factors: seeing the benefits \nI guess looking at landscapes and looking at the improvements that we've made, some really \nencouraging responses to what he was, what he was identifying and seeing improvements in \n \n69 \n \nsome of those perennial plants, even through the drought. We feel we're making some real \nheadway just by changing our grazing practices,  \non one of [our properties], we did fence off 14 or 15 km of river there, but to see the impact of \nthat sort of 10 years down the track, it is pretty eye opening, just particularly with those \ngrasses, native grasses, and how much they are impacted by, not just stock, but all animals. \nBut I've certainly seen the extreme damage that stock on riparian areas can have to the bank, \nand the structure around, you know, the roots of the trees that are along that bank line, \nespecially if it's overgrazed riparian areas. And, you can see it if one farms got riparian zone \nthat un-grazed and the neighbouring property has grazed area the difference in.. I guess the, \nthe quality of the environment is very much noticeable. \nBut then It's amazing to see how quickly it all comes back…  it's amazing to see, it's been \nfenced off from grazing for 15 years and the stark fence line differences there.  \nIt’s just chalk and cheese when you go to our boundary with our beautiful grass and trees and \nbig riverbanks into maximum eroded banks that are moving probably a meter a year every \ntime we get a big flood or big flow events in the river.  \nI think we’ve seen the positive changes in that and we're looking to do it on our, on our other \nriver country as well. \nMotivation – in some circumstances, de-stocking is less effort than stocking \nWell, it was hard to stock, and you couldn't really crop it, so thought we'll do some thing good \nfor the environment. Take it back to what it was. And in the future, it may be worth something \nas carbon. \n… fencing off a riverine environment. Even if you did that that’ll help you don’t have to plant \nnecessarily, you just let it come back, just take the stock off \nBUT not everyone has stock \nNot everyone has stock: a lot of feedback from cotton growing peop le is that they are either \nlightly stocked  \nChallenges – cost and effort \nMaintenance on fencing is, I guess, it's just been difficult to address those issues once again, it \nrequires people, labour, time. \nIt's just been a matter of cost, you know, with the drought and things like that, that's probably \nthe barrier. \nSometimes it's a profitability, thing, really. \nthere’s capital and ongoing costs to doing all of this [fencing riparian areas], which means a \nlot of people just say, oh, I can't be bothered. I’ve got neighbours that say they’re graziers and \nthey’ve got eroding riverbanks. But they work on a low-cost model and water from the river is \na lot cheaper than putting a pump from a trough. \nWe took some areas back to the natural landscape but not a great deal … as we said, the \ngovernment doesn’t support you to do it. \nWe’ve fenced a lot of country, you know, we've probably done close to 30 kms of riparian \nfencing \nit's all about just having the people to be able to address some of these issues  \nThe other thing is the, you know, the, the maintenance on riverine fencing …requires a lot of \nwork,  \noriginally, we put these fences in over 10 years ago now and, I guess, we tried to leave as \nmuch country outside of the area that we fenced on the riverine areas to maximiz e our grazing \nopportunities. But in hindsight what we should have done is it's probably moved our fences \nback out into some more hospitable fencing country I guess, rather than sort of running down \ngullies and stuff, probably taken away a little bit further from the river and that would’ve \nalleviated some of the maintenance issues that we've come across. \nit’s almost like when you’re dry and the rivers lower enough for you to do something, then \nyou've got no cash and then yeah, once you're busy, you're busy cropping and getting cash \nflow, and it is one of those things that does get pushed to the back burner if it's not, you know, \n \n70 \n \nwithin your whole farm system. Yeah, you're trying to make next repayment on a new header \nor whatever you thought of those things get pushed to the back burner. But when you've got the \ntime, you haven't got the money. When you've got the money, you don't have the time.  \nChallenges – loss of water access points \nYou can do all the right things and fence off your creek and riparian areas, [and then you \nhave] a raging drought and…  we'll just let the cows go in there….Now that's all we've got left.  \n…all the good intentions in the world can come undone when finances are tight or … Animals \nare starving \nChallenges – physical access to certain geographical areas \nwe find it difficult to [do that] at times, just due to the fact that riverine country is just so \ndifficult to get around in because of gullies and trees. \nwe also have other areas on farm with naturally-vegetated floodway. And other riparian areas \nthat we didn't put in [to a grant application], because it was just too difficult, we couldn't \nmaintain roads, We couldn't maintain flood banks. It wasn't going to be, practical, on a cotton \nfarm to be able to do that, [to] put that into that conservation trust \nChallenges – secondary negative impacts \nquite often when we have excluded or locked up areas, that they also become secondary issues \nwith bushfire, pests, noxious weeds, So A locked up  area that's not managed has its own,  You \nknow, massive set of issues and challenges that go with it. \nProbably the biggest challenge there is just controlling the weeds and the pests that that creek \nwill harbour.  \nThe tree lines are fenced off from the cattle. But there are some circumstances on the creek \nwhere we do crash graze the banks trying to knock down weed species and trying to establish \nthe native grass species on the banks to stabilize the banks and that's been highly successful… \nBut as a rule the tree lines are fenced off from stock unless we have a particular model like \nthat. \nI don't know that there's a great deal more that we could do apart from linking up those \nwaterholes which would have been in a corridor for small creatures and whatnot. But there's \nnot much point to doing that if we've got a feral pig problem, that's, you know, that sort of \nnegating anything positive \nSo we've excluded domestic animals from there, I guess, what we need to do more is, we need \nto clean that country out to try and get rid of those goats on a much more frequent basis to try \nto take that consistent grazing pressure away.  \nLike, you know, the biggest thing is the weeds. You know, you can have it all beautiful native \ngrasses and whatnot, but the cost of actually controlling the weeds and you've got this \ncontinual flood waters that are coming over, the cost to the individual landholder is just \nastronomical… and you’re lying low because you don't want someone to come in and say, \nlook, you've got to control those weeds in that area because 400 acres when you  don't actually \ngetting an income off it, it's a lot to be controlling these weeds. \nChallenge – lack of clarity about stocking density requirements \nOk, Well, I don't really think our stock impact our river so much  So it's not a It's not a big \nthing. I don't see it as a bigger issue as what it might be in other areas anyway. And it's not for \nus because we have cattle and the most that would have on that river is like 20 cows and \ncalves sort of thing. So, it's not, like thousands of head on it, or anything,  you know. We're not \nbig graziers or anything \nAnd locking livestock out might not be the right scenario in some situations. It might be that \nyou have to, only have them in for two months of the year, or 50% capacity  \nStrategies to strengthen adoption \n \nFunding mechanisms \n[What would it take to put more areas back?]More funding and hopefully more awareness of \nhow important carbon farming is and some value on carbon farming \n \n71 \n \nit would be good to come up with a more enduring mechanism to support that across a ll of \nagriculture, not just cropping systems. There are a lot of different mechanisms that could be \nused. You know, deductibility is another one…A deduction rather than a payment, so that when \nyou do make a profit, you have this extra recognition for what you've carried on behalf of \nsociety. And I think there's a pilot program now within the Federal Department of DAF, too, to \nlook at rewarding natural asset protection development... grabbing those opportunities and \npromulgating them across the industry so that you get this sort of lead/reward cycle, \nhappening where people are piloted into … programs. That become an example for the rest of \nthe community. \nBUT \nFunding is not always the answer \nI don't think the answer really, is probably cash, I think it's something that you're either \ninterested in, or you're not, you know, that's, um, yeah, that'd probably, probably wouldn't be a \nmajor motivator for, for a lot of, a lot of farmers. \nIts ‘complicated’ \nI don't know how you do that,. ... how do you [generate] any benefit from that value? Is it just \nthat managed assets [are] worth more, or are you getting a payment for not using it? ... How \ndo you get the value from locking it up? \nConcern about non-voluntary approaches \nOh, I don’t want to be told to do anything with it. That's sort why I’ve kept my head down on \nthis, because I don't really want someone coming legislating that I’ve got to do this or I’ve got \nto do that..  \nI think the big stick is just going to terrify people. And I didn't even consider that that wo uld be \na part of it, but now hearing about it, I think, yes, that is a problem. You know, you sort of \nreluctant to put your head above the parapet in that situation. \nThat's regulating what you can and can't do. And maybe that is the way of the future. But there \nwould have to be an awful lot of support come with that kind of regulation to say, ‘we’re not to \nhave any livestock in a riparian area’ \nStrengthening management of weeds \nChallenges – time and cost \nthe biggest thing is the weeds... You know, you can have it all beautiful native grasses and \nwhatnot, but the cost of actually controlling the weeds and you've got this continual flood \nwaters that are coming over, the cost to the individual landholder is just astronomical  \nSo it is because of the way, because of the country that it is down there… It's a very difficult \narea to access. And so it's not just the initial going in and removing [weeds, its] getting rid of \nall of the suckers and the seedlings that come up afterwards - all the re growth.... - we would \nlove to able to do it. It's just not something that economically is viable for us \n…We [applied for funding for a] biodiversity officer… employed on managing that country, to \nget rid of the feral species, weeds, pests…. It had to be locked up, there co uld be no wood \ngathering, there could be no bikes, there could only be horses to retrieve other stock, it had to \nbe fenced.  And we had to provide a budget to do that, and so we, went and budgeted, all of \nthose things… [but] it would cost more to do what they expect than the payment that you \nreceive in return \nthey sort of, start spending a few dollars and start cleaning up the weeds … and then all of a \nsudden, they get a flood and they seem to have gone backwards. Some farmers seem to get \ndisillusioned in that process and they seem to have gone backwards \nwe’re quite capable of saying ‘yes it’s great for the beneficials, it’s an ecosystem for them to \nbuild up’, but there’s no actual figure on how many beneficials come out of those weed areas \n… if you could actually put monetary figures on it, you might get more of a shift, but if there’s \nno monetary figure on it I don’t know how you actually convince people that management of \nthose areas is probably a huge benefit for them \n \n72 \n \nin our grazing country, Which is heavily wooded areas, so it's quads & backpack sprays pretty \nwell, which we can’t justify for what we're getting out of the country even on grazing let alone  \nleaving it to natural vegetation….  \n We've got a farm that we do actually graze and the cattle country there costs an absolute \nfortune to keep the roly poly and keep the grass growing instead of sapling trees and roly poly \nat least, and briars. Think last year for about 600 acres it was about $90K \nIt would be exceptionally expensive for us to take that [weed management] program on \nourselves, because of the area that we have down there. It's not somebody else's 10 hectares \nremnant vegetation along the fence line - it is a vast area. It's $70 a hectare to be an able to do \nit. \nAnd you're looking for ways, always looking for ways to sort of minimize inputs and the costs \naround that. \nChallenging practices \nthe controlling of the weeds in these riverine areas that you just it's, it's very it would be very \ndifficult to do. \nBoxthorns are very difficult to try and control, especially in every heavily timbered areas. \nSimilar with the fleabane -  very difficult to control… yeah, it just spreads everywhere \nOne other tool that I'd like looked into is actually, with the natural boxland and the \nshelterbelts - is to actually to do a controlled burn through them to actually help manage some \nof the undergrowth and allow access to get into for to control some of the weeds, because \nsome of it, it's virtually impenetrable \ntrying to control some of the weeds in these areas, but not hit the native things that are \npopping up as well. Yeah, trying to because there's lots of small native things that you want to \nkeep. So, really, it comes down the backpacks [a time-consuming technique] and it's just \nimpossible \nit [the challenge] is being able to get in there and do it, and it is -  a lot of that is inaccessible, \nA lot of it is very wet a lot of the time. And it is a person with a backpack or the it is just very \nlabor intensive to be doing it \nI think, definitely accessibility - in those areas, getting in and being able to manage the weeds, \nits extremely time consuming, labor intensive. And also, there's a higher chance of missing \nareas, or not doing the job that's needed to fully control the different weeds \nOur problem is feathertop rhodes - when you see them, try and pull them out - Quite hard to \nget out during the dry weather \nThere's another side to this because it's difficult. Yeah, in the rest of our lives, or in a lot of \nother areas of our lives, things are becoming easier and easier, or more convenient, These \nparticular things, are very hard. That's going to have to be something that one's about...smart \nsolutions, like biological control, or maybe selective use of drones and that kind of thing, \nselective destruction, purpose, introduce., that kind of thing. There is no easy answer to that \nquestion about strengthening weed control. \nIt's more the weeds the controlling of the weeds in these riverine areas that you just it's, it's \nvery it would be very difficult to do.  \n \nChallenges – compatibility with on farm conditions \nBut the trouble with river flood country, every time you have a flood, a brand new species of \nweed pops up that you didn't have before \nits impossible the accessibility… probably 80% of it is pretty hopeless ..  \nBut the trouble with river flood country, every time you have a flood, a brand new species of \nweed pops up that you didn't have before then that changes sizes that population,  like now \nwe've got ]a new weed] that we didn't have before, and then how do we manage tha t going \nforward? \nWe had a really quick turnaround, from no allocation to deciding to plant a winter crop and \nthe, the period of time to be able to spray this year has been extremely narrow to get on top of \nweeds, and then juggle what's happening around the area as well in terms of chemical choice, \n \n73 \n \nand crop emergence. That, you know, it's been quite a challenging year for weeds this year \neven though it's been excessively dry. \nSeasonal conditions…while they make it tricky, they also provide really good opport unities to \nget on top of things as well. You know, we've had a run of dry summers, which has been really \ngood for getting some things under control \nSo it is because of the way, because of the country that it is down there and the flooding and \nthe way it floods and cuts across the landscape. It's a very difficult area to access.  \n \nChallenges – lack of coordination and area-wide management \nwe do our best to control boxthorn, and they [non-farming neighbours on one side] don't \nreally do anything to manage their weed situation, which makes our work twice as hard. … \nthey're not managing their noxious weeds as everyone should, so it sort of impacts on growers \ndoing things right, and leads to more cost to eradicate the problem, to start with.  \nif we just ignore what's coming down the river and say its too hard We're just gonna get re -\ninfested, we wouldn't do anything… So, either we say, OK, we've got to do what we can do, or \nwe just say, we're not doing anything, because it'll just keep coming. And we would choose to  \nthink, we can do something in the hope that eventually other people will, and it'll start to \nreduce numbers of what's coming down. \nChallenges – concern about unintended negative impacts \nIt's in the riverine area [that’t challenging]. I’d love to go in there with a plane and hit that \n[weed species] but then you bugger up your trees you know. \nBecause the way they [weeds]  invade, waterways and develop very heavy stands in the right \nconditions, you know, usually, after medium to high flows floods.  Yeah, so that can be quite \ndamaging to the level of condition \ninterestingly, on that riverine environment— speaking to some of these scientist guys, that we \ntalk to about it when they came down, to do the ...vegetation, flora and fauna surveys  - If we \ndo go in and clear the buckthorn, and briars and things, we may well have a detrimental effect \non our small bird life that's down there. So it is a real balancing thing \nthe boxthorn some of the boxthorn are quite big, and the briars are quite big. So when we do \ntake those out, we then find that we can have a negative impact on some of the other \nbiodiversity - The small insects and the small birds that are using those areas as protected \nareas from the bigger birds, and the predators. So, by removing that weed species, the invasive \nspecies, we can be having a negative impact on some of the other biodiversity in there. So it's a \nreally tricky sort of thing. \nChallenges – different problem orientation \nI don't see a need to strengthen our weed management program too much more, or, we've got \na pretty good handle on what we should be doing \nI'm not worried about weeds. We can, we can handle weeds, if you can grow weeds, you can \ngrow crops. \nSo we’ve got to look at, um, how these other weeds are managed and whether we look at the \nweeds and I know this is a bit of a left, left sided approach but whether we actually look at \nthem as not weeds but we encompass them into the actual the whole system. And we look at \ntrying to control them in a form of whether it's slashing or whatever before they seed. So, \nthey're actually looked as ground cover and keeping soil together rather than as a negative \neffect of being termed weeds, if you know what I mean. \nsome farmers just think it is probably not their issue, not their problem \nit seems like we're saying Roly Poly is a weed. But Roly Poly is actually a native So it's, -  what, \nwhat are we looking for? And, yeah. So to have a definition around that. And then to have the \nfunding based on that would be great \nBecause it [particular species] is considered a weed in a grazing management scenario. And \nactually in a biodiversity scenario, maybe it's not a weed. Maybe it is one of those ground \ncover, low story, essential species? \nThe one thing that I've noticed, I now see weeds all the time - they become part of a furniture \nalmost.  and if I point them out, you know, if you drive past the same plant 100 times, it's sort \n \n74 \n \nof almost becomes oblivious… and that's, that's definitely a risk with all farmers, that what you \nsee all the time can quite often just be…, not something that they notice, if they're not looking \nfor it \nBut I like their idea of not thinking of them as weeds in riverine areas, thinking of them as \nground cover and try to no let them set seed because the other way from a biodiversity \nperspective is that, yes, that's where some of our pests come from, but that's also where a lot of \nour beneficials have the ability to build up, because obviously, if we don't have any crops \nthere's no way for them to live so the weeds in riverine areas and the sides of roads and those \nsorts of spots are where they're going to come from. \nI think weeds are part of biodiversity and how we're trying to do that is by doing everything \nbasically with spot sprays and cutting down the amount of chemical we're putting into that, in \nthe environment \nFactors that would support strengthening weed management  \n \nCoordinated approaches  \nIf you're on a watercourse, especially, everyone's got to be on board, otherwise you're going to \nbe constantly spending the money to other people's problems. And I guess that's also a big \ndriver for people wanting to manage their own country as well, is like those weeds are moving \nout into farming areas who are having to manage them. So if we can manage them as a whole, \nwe're still going to be better off in our own farming systems but if you can get everyone on \nyour watercourse involved, you're not going to have that weed spreading every time we get a \nFlood event. It just moving straight back in again, and youre, starting from scratch, again.  \nneed to look at that area wide-systems as well - so it's, it's one thing for person to have it under \ncontrol, but, two places upstream, but they don't do anything. So, that stuff's really hard and I \ndon't know how you implement that, that level of co-operation \nI mean, everyone has to manage their own system, but it's gotta be part of a bigger system  \nHowever, coordinated approaches were not simple:  \n[but] someone needs to run it. That's the always the crux of these things [re area wide \nmanagement].  \nOther types of support \n \nFinancial incentives \n, it’s a dollar factor. Ultimately what gets people over the line with things is an incentive. \nEducation \nSo it's I think education is probably the biggest one is to say, well, look, you know, these are \nthe benefits, if you if you do it, do it long term \nSo, you know, our charter is to engage everyone, not individuals, in a positive min dset… we've \ngotta get everyone on the page and you know, Change takes time, but results speak for \nthemselves So, I think that's part of the charter. is to come in saying, we all agree that it needs \nto change \nSupport with engagement with systems \nI think another thing with those programs—theres quite often a bit of reporting that goes with \nit and trying to get even a 1  pager filled out cam be very difficult at times. And if you've got to \nsit down and work out which areas need control and the problem areas, the weeds, How are \nyou going to control it? That's, it requires quite a lot of detail to work within those programs \nso that they've got recordable outcomes as well. So, definitely have someone that's helping \nfarmers along with that particular requirements is beneficial \nShifting norms \nI think it's, sometimes it can, it’ll evolve with peer pressure, the more famers the jump in the \nboat and do these things, the guys that aren’t doing it they want to jump in and make sure \nthere’s a seat in the boat \nYou want to try to use the top 10% or 20% are your target, those growers, they’re usually the \nearly adopters, and I think once you target those and it becomes a success the other guys \nfollow. \nTrial new approaches \n \n75 \n \nBut I mean if we shouldn't be doing some sort of trial patches to see what we can do with it? I \nmean, if you put patches of, planted patches of kangaroo grass or blue grass or whatever it \nmaybe it’d spread out eventually, maybe that's what you gotta do, start sort, of nurseries along \nthe length of the creek to let it naturally spread because there's no way you're going to get with \na tractor or spray rate or whatever. \nStrengthening management of feral animals \nChallenges – cost \nThe new sodium nitrate baiting system that developed originally researched by the invasive \nanimal CRC....so that could essentially lead to very effective wild pig management across the \nnation, let alone you know.in our section of the river or whatever, …but the bait Box itself, \nwhich is part of the label for the baiting Program, is 600 something dollars  \nAnd then the program of placebo baits is another like 200 than the actual baits is three or \n$400. So its over $1000 for one program.  You get to keep the box and use it again, but still. \n…We [applied for funding for a] biodiversity officer… employed on managing that country, to \nget rid of the feral species, weeds, pests…. It had to be locked up, there could be no wood \ngathering, there could be no bikes, there could only be horses to retrieve other stock, it had to \nbe fenced.  And we had to provide a budget to do that, and so we, went and budgeted, all of \nthose things… [but] it would cost more to do what they expect than the payment that you \nreceive in return \nChallenges – difficulty \n[on controlling feral cats] Because they like the live kill and they’re also tricky to trap that \napart from people walking around with shotguns and being a very good shot, but really I don’t \nknow what else you can do widespread to control it \nBut in achieving the NRM goals that we had originally intended, we've found it difficult to do \nthat, and we find it difficult to even get the goats at times, just due to the fact that riverine \ncountry is just so difficult to get around in because of gullies and trees. We’re now using gyros \nto, to get the goats out of there, which is much more effective. \nThe barrier is, a couple of the areas that we could look at excluding is known as the jungle, \nlike, it's hard to get access and hard to manage those areas and, and to even know where to \nstart with, sort of, I guess, getting rid of some species and encouraging others.  \nChallenges – lack of coordination and area-wide management \n...often when you're talking to a neighbour, we, end up talking about [feral] dogs — and then \nyou'll find that one neighbour has gone and done a 1080 program. And they rings up to say, \noh, we just put 1080 round ..., so keep your dog's locked up and what t he hell - Why didn't we \ntalk about this as a group? We talked about dogs all the time and then one person goes and \ndoes something. \nit's lack of a focal focus point around co-ordination that, that sort of causes that. We talk about \nthe problem in the community kinda way, but we actually go and do individual things about it \non our farm and somehow we need … there is this opportunity there for better co -ordination, \nwhere are we, where we can coalesce that motivation everyone has, but not necessarily to do it \nin a coordinated and more effective manner \nProbably, one of the main issues with it is that we don't really have any neighbours on that \ncreek who would share, you know Queensland gas and coal mine are on the other side so \nthey’re not desperately concerned about a pig's population or mother of millions problem \ndown there \n[on pigs] We basically have an area wide management approach on that because of working \nwith neighbours on that with the country. There's no point in chasing them off yours with a \nchopper onto someone else's. \nArea wide management easier with ferals than weeds: Yeah the feral animals …It seems to be \nmuch easier to get a agreement between people that live together close by to control them \nwhilst they’re mobile - they're almost not as mobile in water as weeds can be. They don't travel \nas far. Probably as weeds can travel through the whole valley, in the in floodwaters.  \nLike, the biggest issue for us is goats.We have a little of difficulty controlling goats on the river \nand, know, we spend a lot of time trying to increase ground cover, when it's dry and the river \n \n76 \n \nis not flowing, goats can basically can just walk across the river from other country and graze \nthose areas that we've been trying to protect. \nFocusing on species that impact productivity vs species that impact biodiversity \n \nThe capacity to visualise a problem, or see the beneficial impact of a management practice, can influence adoption of a \nnew management practice.  With regard to conceptualising the ‘problem’ —issues that are easily visualised generated \nstrong problem recognition in participants.  For example, certain feral animals are visible to growers,  \n[Why do you think it's easier to get people to work together on ferals and not weeds?] Yeah, \neasier to manage and it’s the same cost for everyone. So if everyone's involved, there's no \ninequity in the cost of managing it, and then you also get funding from LLS and that sort of \nthing....in terms of animal control than weed control, really, they're a much easier a thing to \nsee and control,  they’re cheaper. It's easier to organize a group of people to do it. So, they get \non pig baiting or on their pig shooting. Everyone gets on board, and Almost far easier. To get \npeople to do it, pigs will come in and cause an economic impact far more than s ome of the \ninvasive woody weeds will in farming areas. So people are more willing to spend money \ngetting rid of them \nWe've certainly seeing quite a lot of cats getting around. When I say, quite a lot on one block \nof 2000ha there would have to be a family of 20 odd cats getting around, see them at night \nwhile irrigating … I've noticed them a lot more than ever before. That cats are getting pretty \nout of control I think.  \nThere are a few wild dogs there that I'm sure, you know, maybe they've got 10% dingo in them, \nbut there's they're mostly just feral dogs. I think they probably put a fairly good dent in the \npigs, Um, you know just making their own sort of balance. I suppose that I don't, it's not a very \npopular sort of opinion, but I don't mind a dog or two in context to controlling a pig or ten. \nBut we’re not so worried about the foxes and cats just because they're not obvious and they \ndon’t seem to be doing too much to the crops themselves people just don't worry about them so \nmuch, or they’re not front of mind because they're not eating the sorghum or they’re not eating \nthe corn or they’re not eating the cotton, so that’s probably why they’re not in front of mind. \nBut it'd be nice for them, to be able to do something with them so that they're not taking out the \nnative species … when the mice disappear they’re going to eat something else, so I just don't \nknow how you keep on top of the cats because it's a bit sneaky.  \nOne potential challenge with high visibility and high compatibility issues, such as those rel ated to feral animals, is that \nthe focus of discussions veered towards focusing on goals related to farm productivity, which may not necessarily \noverlap with biodiversity-related goals.  \nMain problems are pigs and dogs which affect productivity - the smaller [feral] animals \n[such as cats and rabbits] … they're not necessarily economically important. You know, what \nthey are they do go under the radar a bit... like you'd talk to Control Officers in the Council \nabout rabbits and they can be quite dismissive that rabbits aren't really a problem, they just \ncall them homestead pest, just around houses and that kind of thing \nwe’ve got a lot of ‘roo pressure here at the moment … We've got a lot of pressure on our wheat \nat the moment … even though they’re not feral, I think they are [a pest] \none of the downfalls of having larger wildlife is brolgas … they certainly can do a lot of \ndamage in wheatfield in in a day. So as much as I love having the wildlife on the farm, I did \nspend a lot of time driving around the fields, just shooing them [away] \nIf it's a bit tricky to when, I know we talk Ferals but, but, you plant a crop or something... 300 \nbrolgas are every bit as damaging… or Wallabies, Kangaroos anything… When the \npopulation gets out of whack, then, anything is the problem  - a pest I suppose \nThings that would support strengthening \n \nArea wide management  \nI think we need to get better at working with the neighbour’s - we’re not great at that. \nSo lot of these things that you really would like to be concentrating or spending more time on \nit's just really difficult to do that. So, you know, have could we address that?  \n \n77 \n \nI think it's not unlike the weeds question, in a way… harnessing area wide moti vation to act, \nyou know, so co-ordination and funding are probably the two things that would get a bit of \naction around here. \nI think that's the whole point of biodiversity. You know, you can't really, you can't just look \nafter your own patch, it's gotta be, it's a bigger picture there's no point in me killing all our \ncats if they’re just gonna breed up next door… \nI can't even imagine them [my local council] doing the programs that you're talking about. I \nimagine [such programs] will led by councils like Scenic Rim and Lockyer Valley and places \nwhere there's high numbers of landholders. Their drivers are around their natural landscape \nand visitor and tourism, so that council has a benefit … [whereas] this council… in our \nregion… we don’t even hit their radar I don’t think \nMaybe we could have, you know, someone coming in and doing surveillance work on numbers \nof goats we've got it riparian areas. You know, trying to help us to sort of because it's difficult \nto understand just how many you’ve got in there. \nInformation & education \n, if there was a bit more advertising around that area, know, nows the months to go after foxes \nor now's the time to go after the pigs or whatever \nMore information isn’t always the solution \nI get the need for more education, but, I mean, how many, how many of the information sheets \nthat come in the newspaper, or the magazine, or in the mailbox or on the e -mail, do you \ncomprehensively read now, before you put them in the bin? Sometimes I feel like that stuff is \nwasted effort \nPeer support \nI think seeing it occur on someone's farm, and that peer-to-peer discussion seems to, you know, \nwork when you gather a group of grower's together, or a group of farmers together. And \nthey're actually visually seeing the benefits and the or the economic losses happen.   \nI definitely think there's value in going to other regions to see what they're doing. But it also, \nthere's a time cost to that. And expenses, in getting away, and leaving the farm to see what's \nhappening elsewhere, but there's certainly some massive benefits to doing it, as well. \nOther comments about feral management \n \nGeneral experiences suggest strong problem recognition \nCertainly some aerial shooting in some area groups I think that's been a bit of a success with \npigs. \nI'm not sure whether you guys have too many cat problems, but it's unfortunately with cats. I \nthink it's not so much that you can see them digging up the crop, it's just that you see them, you \nknow, crossing the road at night and there's just a lot of unseen damage, I beli eve, with them \nwith feral cats. That would probably be, you know, the number one thing I'd love to solve right \nnow.  \nPigs in a practical way straightaway, but, um, I think cats are probably a big one that knock \naround bird life  \nCertainly a bounty on feral cats, I think that'd be great, it’d also bring in a few, I'm sure \npeople would enjoy it, that's probably one thing. \nWe’re kind of fortunate, our farming land borders the town, so we don't tend to see too many \npigs. We just are involved with the aerial shooting, I've think I’ve done three times in the last \n12 months and then just baiting for the pigs.  \nBut there's always going to be challenges. And I guess it could be people that don't want to be \na part of it as well. There be some people that, And that, and that's just, it's human nature.  \n \nStrategies – industry targets \nSupport for industry targets \n \n78 \n \nindustry programs seem to get a lot more traction, than something that government puts [out], \nso if we can be proactive in addressing some of our issues that are going to meet sustainability \ngoals and it's implemented with the input of growers... I certainly think there's a si gnificant \nplace for the cotton industry to be involved \nIf I had, like, some quite strong direction from industry, like, you know, plant X amount of \ntrees in this location, then, that will assist with this outcome. \nI'd really like to see some goals and objectives bought out of it [this CRDC project]. That \nwe’re going to work towards as an industry, and then some steps of strategies to improve - \nwhether that's on farm or as an industry and where that puts us… But I think going on, from \nthat, there needs to be solid standards. \nas an industry, where [are] we going and what [is] the end goal so that we can get everyone \non board. And then in work towards a common goal. \n \nTargets need to be achievable \nMany participants highlighted the need for targets to achievable, and applicable to diverse regions and farming \ncontexts:  \nWhat, I guess, what I'm hoping to get out of it, is, like, if we do have some targets, they need to \nbe realistic and achievable, um, and I guess, applicable for our region. \nA fairly obvious [starting point] would be set a very realistic target in the first instance, … \nyou’re trying to get people to get motivated to commit to it.. start the bar quite low to get \npeople involved and progress from there …. Yeah, to get those targets achieved, but yeah Start \nsmall and build up to it, rather than a ridiculous, unachievable target to start with would turn \npeople away from the whole concept. \nConsider achievable entry points \nif we kept it basic … that would be a starting point \nif people start having those small wins and then the benefit from just one thing. Not trying to \ndo [everything] at once, or, you know, just to in manageable sizes that aren't overwhelming  \nJust to start with, maybe we can pick patches that are a bit more accessible \nit comes back to manageability - I've seen other people take on these large tree planting \nprojects - But then I had more than half of them die because they weren't able to manage them. \nWhereas, if you start with maybe 10 trees that you have the capacity to manage until they're \npast that establishment phase and then work up … it has to be, something that you can do, as \nwell as doing all the other tasks on your farm \nPeople basically want to try things within their sphere. I wouldn't discount maybe just running \nsome more simplified workshops. \nRecognise existing achievements \nI guess for us, … we don't really have anywhere that we need to replant trees. It's happened. \nIt's done… So for us it's probably not about revegetation, it's about increasing the biodiversity \nin the vegetated areas that are already there. How we do that, I'm not really sure? And it gets \nquite frustrating for us … there is no real talk around how we can fund the people that have \npassed phase one,  they have the trees, they have the macro,  how do we increase the other \nthings like [small threatened species]. \nyou put in a [funding] submission [to protect existing vegetation] … ours came back, as ‘no, \nit's too big an area’, It's not financial’... no disrespect to the smaller projects, but I think the \nbiodiversity challenge is - are we looking after existing biodiversity or are we trying to \nreplant, build biodiversity? Are CRDC looking to increase biodiversity on cotton farm? Or are \nthey looking to promote the ones that where it already is? \nPreference for voluntary approaches \nTargets always make me nervous. .It's just that people choose to pick up on the negative areas. \nThe only other things, too, I find when you have targets and things like that. the only n egative \nthing I find is it's often the same people who do the heavy lifting for the majority of the industry \nand that can be a bit tiring after a while \n \n79 \n \neveryone has their own ideas on what's the best way to work this piece of land… it's really \ntricky –you can’t be prescriptive in how things are done farm to farm, there's a level of \nindependence there that doesn't necessarily. work with you [re] biodiversity  \n I don’t want to be told to do anything with it. That's sort why I’ve kept my head down on this, \nbecause I don't really want someone coming legislating that I’ve got to do this, or I’ve got to \ndo that \nI think the big stick is just going to terrify people \nat the moment, we're talking about things that are voluntary and that sort of thing.  Yeah, I \nguess if we become more transparent about the biodiversity on farms and, you know, in most \nscenarios I think people are doing everything in their power to manage a nd to the best of their \nability, um, but, you know, whether, we become more transparent. And they start looking at \nthings a little bit closer and then yeah some things become mandated that potentially weren’t \nin before. I think there's obviously the risk of that, as you, as you start to publicize these sorts \nof things, you open up to greater scrutiny on what we are doing. … I would agree with what \nshe said about - there is a real risk that we do get out there and say, we have these great areas \nof biodiversity. And the government then puts serious restrictions on what we can do in those \nareas. \nStrategies – Provide financial support and innovative ways to value biodiversity \nStrong support for financial incentives \n…if you actually asked them to go and plant those trees and pay for those trees they probably \nwouldn't do it. \nincentives, there needs to be incentives. Because it is, you know, it's not primary business \nprobably for anyone to do this \nthe revegetation stuff, its quite expensive, it needs to be fairly well managed and dedicated… \ncould be some form of subsidy for revegetation \nBut financial incentives wont change everyone \nI think it's something that you're either interested in, or you're not, you know, , that probably  \n[cash] wouldn't be a major motivator for a lot of farmers. \nConsider how to value biodiversity in new ways \nIf you get a valuation, the valuer will tell you that, that country's only worth, you know, 5% or \nsomething of your developed area...But the, the science around, over the ecosystem services \nand what the what those areas of remnant environment can contribute to the cropping system \nand to the rest of the farm is pretty well established…It's just that we're not conditioned to see \nit. \n…he showed me on his phone, a photo of a Koala that he'd taken down the river on his farm \nand I said, I asked him how much he thought it [the koala] was worth, and… we had a chat \nabout it, like, what is it worth? In central Queensland? What is a nail -tailed wallaby worth? \nHow to value existing, older trees? \n... it's got old trees in it, and that it's been there for a long time - it should probably be valued \ndifferently to just someone going out there and planting a few new trees like, surely, know, a \n200 year old tree is worth more than a one year old tree. … Because to me, that the old stuff \nthat's been there forever surely is more valuable [than] regenerating, replanting new areas  \nConsider innovating financing mechanisms, learn from carbon farming initiatives  \nthat's the brilliant idea to talk about carbon farming. … to get a benefit out of it for 10 years, \nbut if they've got a 10-year plan in place. …they'll get a financial benefit from it, but on the \nway they've made an improvement to the sustainability of the environment …bird life has \nimproved, weeds have been able to be controlled, but at the end of the day… o have some sort \nof a payoff At the end of the program. \nWe need a financial reward and the way you have financial reward is to have a trading \nplatform that you can trade your biodiversity … the only way to work out the value of \nbiodiversity and for that matter carbon, is to put it to the open market. \n \n80 \n \nThis led to many participants questioning whether a ‘biodiversity credits’ system would be feasible for \nconsideration?  \nthe whole carbon farming Initiative has sort of taken off in the last few years. So I guess people \nare asking the questions, is there a way that we can offset the cost of doing this [biodiversity \nmanagement] in country that's currently not productive ... It's definitely a, a desir e to create \nsustainable landscape, but I think finding a way in which we can, I guess, offset some of the \ncost. … which is why there's been an interest in the carbon farming side of things.  \nBeware divergence in goals \nyou already have a new industry out there, which is the carbon industry. …you need to look \nhard at how carbon to doing it… going forward if it becomes ‘carbon is tradeable biodiversity \nis tradable,’ it's the same as growing wheat or barley. People will end up going for whichever \none is going to be the most economic benefit for them. … I think if the biodiversity isn't part of \nthat somehow, then I do feel like biodiversity will get lost. Because when it comes to carbon… \nit's far more established already than the biodiversity is. And it's a crazy system because the \nbiodiversity should be first. Carbon is a by-product. So, I find it really confusing, perplexing \nthat biodiversity is this hard to get off the ground \nSo, if they're not on the biodiversity early enough, people will go down the carbon wr ote all \nsimply read vegetating with trees, not putting in the ground covers, and the lower story stuff, \nwhich is all really important to get a fully diverse ecosystem out there. So, they're going to \nhave to be, I think, on the biodiversity with carbon bandwagon or people are going to pick up \ncarbon, because economically, that's where they're going to see a return. \nRecognition that other financial influences may emerge \n…the other thing here, too, is I notice, banks and insurance are really looking closely at this \nside of agriculture  \nThe green financing is probably where a lot of the drivers for prioritizing biodiversity on farm \nwill, the push, will come. Whether it's insurance companies or banks that want those particular \nareas managed, well managed, and prioritized on farm and, you know, as a result, a reduction \nin, say, say fees or, lending, you know, lending interest fees.  \nWe were asked in our annual relationship meeting with our banker if we had a ‘sustainability \nstatement’. ‘Actually, no we don’t, what does that look like? Just send us an example and we'll \ndevelop our own.’ If you can give us a bit of an idea of what you think the template looks like \nfor a farming business, then we'll be happy to do it’. But right now, I don't even know what that \nlooks like.  …, so creating some tools for growers around that would I think be a real \nopportunity for us \nOne participant highlighted that stronger performance on environmen tal indicators may also influence \ndecisions about investing in farms:  \nthe thing about the carbon path … it could be a traceability [issue], one where preference in \ntime is to buy from a carbon neutral farm that is measured.  So, you could attract the firs t \nbid… we could see, a more attractive client base to our product. \nStrategies – Information, education, and advice \nProvide clear information and advice \nwe think that it's got value - we're engaged We ‘re keen . What do we need to do?  How do we \nneed to get there? - That's where we need some help \nin terms of support, I guess it's a good understanding of —usually people need numbers and \nresearch and that sort of thing. So, having a really good understanding of what what's driving \nthese ecosystems and what we can do, like what influence we can actually have based on \ndifferent management strategies. \nI need access to education -  I don't want to plant anything on the farm that's not already here, \n… this is the sort of thing you should plant here and where to get that or, you know, if I have to \ngrow myself and seed it myself, how do I do that? I still need more education on just how to do \nit well. ...How do we plant well, and regenerate well, and do it properly - not just throwing \nanything in there and spraying weeds, knocking out something else that's important  \n \n81 \n \nA lot of our native species tend to like a fire to get them activated in the seed pods and things. \nBut yeah, I'd like to see a lot more information about how to best manage things like that, to \nactually promote them \nif it was based on [a carbon farming approach], I mean, we need more info… What grants are \navailable? You know, what sort of population is of trees do you need to plant per square meter \nor square hectare. What are the rules and regs, and what, what are the impacts? What are the \nbenefits along the way? \nImportance of more active support, such as consultants:  \nwhat would probably best suit our needs is, like a consultant, they could sit down and look at \nthe whole farm plan, and areas, and do a management plan , a 4 or 5 year plan. What's the \nbest plan of attack to do all the tasks at hand?  \nMake positive outcomes measurable \n \nBeing able to observe the impacts of biodiversity management practices has the potential to reinforce adoption and \nsupport continuing engagement in these practices:  \nAnd, you know, the further we get into it, the more species we start to see returning, \n…suddenly they start to see grasses, returning that [they] hadn’t seen since [being] a kid, you \nknow, that's, that's really encouraging \nMany benefits of biodiversity management are not immediately visible. This highlights the importance of being able to \nmeasure impacts as a way of feedback on practices:  \nsome of it, too, is about knowing if you get it right. What are we trying to do? Is it actually a \npositive or a negative impact?  \nHow would you measure biodiversity? How would you how actually measure it? Yeah, I can \nsee acres and whatever, but you need to know in those acres [that] you're doing the right thing \nand things are thriving and it's being looked after as well - so to me that's a little bit tricky. \n…trying to prove that decisions we're making around trying to trust beneficial insects to carry \nthe load when most advice is to use insecticides, has been one of the more difficult things in \nterms of production decisions.  First of all I need to identify what biodiversity outcomes can we \nfirstly achieve and then secondly, can we measure? to try to measure, and prove it does is \n[important]. \nI'd like to know what is working well here and what isn't - like, what, what things are thriving \nand what's working well, and what things need help, sort of thing. Just to know, how we can \nhelp different species ...You know, how can we protect those, those things that are more \nthreatened \nI guess if we knew a little bit more about the actual benefits of those beneficial insects and \nanimals that are in our crop systems … If that was maybe highlighted a bit, it might give, quite \na few people a handy way to justify contributing to the situation, across the industry as well If \nit was well known  how that how the good impacts can be done. \nProvide opportunities to learn from others and directly experience new approaches \n I think the successful thing is, neighbours talking to neighbours \nI think it'd be great to look a lot more into what guys are doing around the district  \nDemonstration projects \nI'm big on demonstration, we need case studies. There are people that are starting to do things \nvery differently to traditional high input agriculture and just really encouraging stuff, …  we \nneed to be able to demonstrate it \nduring my travels, I've got to see how other countries are broaching biodiversity, and it's  now \nunder regulation in many countries, and the large, expansive fields, with no trees, no, \nvegetation is not something that they practice any longer …we have the potential to catch up.  \nwe're starting to see some examples around the world, doing things ve ry differently, and \nencouraged by that and we're starting to think about looking to do some of those things \nourselves. \nShowcasing the practices of other growers can activate positive norms that motivate others :  \n \n82 \n \nI think it's, sometimes it can, it’ll evolve with peer pressure, the more famers the jump in the \nboat and do these things, the guys that aren’t doing it they want to jump in.  \nYou want to try to use the top 10% or 20% are your target, those growers, they’re usually the \nearly adopters, and I think once you target those and it becomes a success the other guys \nfollow. \nDemonstration projects can strengthen community perceptions of the industry:  \n…To let them view 1 or 2 or 3 projects, that can actually see what has happened, what's \nhappening, and then, that's a big thing everyone driving around these days. Um, then, if you \neducate one person like that, it probably feeds back to hundred others eventually  \nEmphasise diverse benefits  \n \nHighlight integration with biodiversity and other parts of the far m system \nThings happen so slowly out here so regeneration is not quick but to be honest, you know, \nwe've almost run these things totally separate. I don’t see a lot of overlap between what we're \ndoing in our grazing operation and what we’re doing in our cotton business but you know \nwe’re keen to change that. \nIntegrated pest management  \nHaving this bank of beneficial insects and birds living in that tree line over there that saves me \nputting on $50 per hectare sprays and insecticide, that adds up every day o f the week \nI think that the language around the benefits of what things like your birds, bats -  are doing on \nfarm, you know, eating their own weight in insects, if we can provide that habitat and then sort \nof, I guess how many bats does it take to control this many insects,  providing through \nextension some of the. The tangible outcomes of these, these wildlife on your farm, would \ncertainly be helpful at the moment. \nBiodiversity for me - has been a big thing in this insect, bird and bat spectrum for us trying to \nanalyse how much contribution they give to control of pests insects. \nI suppose, as an agronomist, we're sort of trying to work in that regard with IPM, so using any \nof those native vegetation areas or tree lines through beneficial management, for pest and \nbeneficial management \nWell, I guess I'm, um, the really obvious one in terms of cropping system, is beneficial insects. \nSo, yeah, the recruitment of all those insects into a monoculture basically in the productive \narea, like the cropping area, They have to come from somewhere. [if]  they’re further away, \nand it's going to take longer time.…Proximity to, to the crop is a big thing. \nReduced chemical use \nSpray Drift is a big part of management, getting better understanding on. We run, shelterbelts, \na few shelterbelts to try and protect most, to try to find a better option and practices in \nfarming, \nPollination \nI think, particularly in relation to, you know, the whole world is aware of bees now, know, and \nthat's probably something that, you know, that we need to also get on board with. And if part \nof that is, you know, reducing our pesticide use to get to literally one spray, or, I think, I think \nit'd be great if we could set some really ambitious targets too, you know, to just have zero \ncollateral.Yeah, I don't know how you could do that but I think that'd be a pretty admirable \ngoal really, and I think that would probably resonate a lot with a customer more so than trees \nplanted etc if it's, you know, no bees are harmed in this, in fact, they are important pollinators \nfor us, et cetera, et cetera, I think that'd be, that would really resonate. \nSo, doing shelterbelts between very large fields. And it's, you know, so reasons like not only \njust wildlife corridors, but it's also to slow the movement of wind where they have a lot of the \nextended drought periods. They [are] really moving away from that that large expensive \nprairies to slow that management of the air across large fields. Which then is preventing \nerosion as well…. It's also being used for biosecurity purposes. You know, to prevent that \nwind-spread of diseases, as well. … it's something that we're probably a long way behind, \nExperiencing wildlife \n \n83 \n \nI might be very amazed at how much effect those cats are having. All those small lizards and \nthings things you spoke of. You know, there was a real benefit to some of those animals in the \nwhole ecosystem, and cats are taking part of that away, well,  \nOn a positive note, I can sort of remark on what we've experienced in the last year or two with, \nparticularly the moment with wetter seasons. I reckon this year, for the first time in our lives, \n…  we've got a big, big flock of pelicans on our storage dam at the moment. it just takes water. \nwe've definitely noticed a lot more bird life…Pretty positive… … you know, it shouldn't be \nenvironment versus farming, when you're farming, you're providing that irrigation \nenvironment. Yeah. We get brolgas and all sorts of beautiful birds \nThe other thing that I've been really excited to see, we have a lot of straw-necked ibis and lots \nof microbats around at the moment. \n…he showed me on his phone, a photo of a Koala that he'd taken down the river on his farm \nand I said, I asked him how much he thought it [the koala] was worth, and… we had a chat \nabout it, like, what is it worth? In central Queensland? What is a nail -tailed wallaby worth? \nI've currently got a whole heap of Zebra finches. I've got quite a long strip that we're not \nslashing so that they've got somewhere to hide – they’re in the chickpeas,  they’re just \neverywhere, I've never seen so many Zebra finches before in my life, so it's pretty exciting to \nsee. So I'm just sort of trying to be aware of the areas that we do slash and make sure that \nthey've got some cover around. \nEcosystem services \n… we see great opportunities arising out of this project. You know, we're looking at what other \nrevenue opportunities might be around? You know, we’re obviously looking at soil carbon and \nthat's, that's one of the focuses of the project but we're also looking at being able to, what \nother ecosystem services can we cash in on? You know, and, you know, I guess biodiversity is \none of those that we're looking to measure through this project. \nStrategies – Coordinated approaches \nConsider area-wide management \nI think it's that group approach, because you can actively managing and then next door can be \ndoing nothing. And I think that's always been an issue … It's got to be, the group approach is \nthe only way to do it \n… Totally  agree, it needs to be an area wide management strategy. \nI think there's, you know, in most cases people want to be good neighbours and using that to \nthe best advantage in the area wide management setting \nI think a strategic approach, like a, you know, an area - if you feel everyone is looking to do \nthis, then you're more likely to get involved, than if you try and do it on your own  … And that \ncreates some motivation too \nNot all farmers are motivated to participate in area-wide schemes  \none of the main issues with it is that we don't really have any neighbours on that creek… \n[large, non-farming industries] are on the other side so they’re not desperately concerned \nabout pig populations or mother of millions problem  \nNeed to coordinate support services \nit's more, knowing what people can do, knowing their limitations, and knowing where to go to \nget help, because I think that is half the struggle, \nAnd also sort of access to funding and things that could help us to improve that if it’s there, \nit’s a minefield that there's so many people operating in these spaces, -  it's really hard to get \nyour head around it all \nwe need someone central to co-ordinate this type of thing, but is the LLS [Local Land \nServices] already supposed to be doing that? \nIt's managed by lots of different groups, rather than being managed as a whole distributed \nthrough the groups. I think that might be a bit of an issue with the fu nding. It's awfully hard as \na grower to chase down grants and things \n \n84 \n \n[on funding and labour force] I feel like those opportunities of sort of dried up bit, unless I'm \njust not looking in the right spots. It seemed like Lls and landcare have invested more i n \npeople we’d be happy to do tree planting and things like that but to me, it seems like by the \ntime you find a grant they are only open for 5 or 6 weeks and we'll miss a deadline and then, \num, once again, if you don't have the labour to do the planting and things like that, it would be \ngreat to see some collaboration with the people who are looking for work  \nif it was based on [a carbon farming approach], I mean, we need more info… What grants are \navailable? You know, what sort of population is of trees do you need to plant per square meter \nor square hectare. What are the rules and regs, and what, what are the impacts? What are the \nbenefits along the way? There’s a hell of a lot to it, - so someone to co-ordinate what all that \nmeans, and make it [information] pretty accessible, that'd be great start. I reckon that would \ngive the program some real legs. \nWe've just been noting all the way through the conversation of area wide management. An \noverview, from, from a regional point of view, from someone who's a cen tral body, That can \ncontrol the whole picture, instead of, you know, people trying to do it on their own, and people \nindividually, you know, putting their hand in their pocket to do these sorts of things… I mean, \nlittle areas within regions vary according to that surrounding attributes, but a regional view \non it probably needs to be co-ordinated to be better than is has been. \nPartnering with research institutions \nFrom a consultancy perspective, and from a grower perspective, it's just, I guess, making sure  \nthat we have the information coming through from researchers. And then practical examples \nin the paddock where that's working and then pushing that out to the rest of the industry.  \nthere's a real disconnect between, uh, the universities, and on farm - that needs to be brought \ntogether. I think CRDC need to break that wall down, and to break that disconnect … I think \nthe CRDC need to put a lot of effort into bringing that expertise to the bring that to the table \nfor us to, to sort of all work together. And if you, if you can, put like minds together, it's \namazing what you can do. \n \n  \n \n85 \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix D.

There are some important differences between simple behaviours in the home and agricultural \npractices that add complexity to the task of practice change.  For example, water-saving behaviours are \nsimple actions typically performed multiple times daily that are automatic.  In contrast, most agricultural \npractices are more complex ‘sets of behaviours’ that are performed less frequently.  Rather than being \nautomatic, these are often planned actions that may be strongly linked to livelihood success and cultural \nidentity.  \nDespite these differences, this document is included to provide an overview of behavioural science and \napproaches to behaviour change.", "meta": {"filename": "00294fcd04e8_NLP2103_QUT_Final_Report_%25283%2529.pdf", "path": "data/raw/00294fcd04e8_NLP2103_QUT_Final_Report_%25283%2529.pdf", "size_bytes": "2916609", "mtime": "2025-08-22T17:52:13.413940", "source_url": "https://www.insidecotton.com/sites/default/files/article-files/NLP2103_QUT_Final_Report_%25283%2529.pdf", "source_page": "https://www.insidecotton.com/categories/2021-final-reports", "title": "Perceptions of strategies to strengthen biodiversity management - Perspectives from the cotton industryDeans, Angela (Queensland University Of Technology, 2021-12-01)", "year": "2021"}}

The broad aim of the project case studies was to evaluate how MAR \nmight be feasible for irrigated cotton production and associated cropping systems in the focus regions, and make \nrecommendations on further work to evaluate local hydrogeological conditions, plan the necessary site-specific \ninfrastructure, and establish the legal, social and organisational conditions for implementation of MAR. \nThe focus of this report is the third case study of the MAR feasibility project, the Lower Namoi valley in the Namoi \nRiver catchment. This case study experiments with using a desktop analysis to initiate discussion from an \noperational, site specific perspective based on currently available data that draws on, but distinguishes it from, the \nprevious work on MAR in the catchment. The area of interest (AOI) for our sub-regional analysis is the area of \npreviously mapped high MAR suitability in the east of the Lower Namoi groundwater source (between Narrabri and \nWee Waa). This area is part of a highly developed irrigated agriculture industry (where cotton is an important crop) \nthat already makes use of large capacities of farm dams, conjunctive surface and groundwater use, and flood water \nmanagement.  \nThe broad approach taken was to draw on evidence from a holistic feasibility assessment to scope a set of plausible \nbut widely different opportunities (“scenarios”) for MAR, and to test and refine these scenarios with local \nstakeholders and state government stakeholders. Given the developed nature of the AOI, any new water \nmanagement solution (in this case MAR) is an attempt to optimise an existing capability rather than an initial \nattempt at meeting a need. In this respect, gains from optimising the status quo are unlikely to provide new water, \nbut rather to provide greater control over where and when water is available. \n \nOpportunities for MAR in the area of interest \nThe ‘status quo’ \nOn-farm water storages are critical to irrigators’ ability to store and access water in normal conditions, in dry years, \nand from wet years, but they suffer from high evaporation losses. Between years, certain water allocation licence \n(WAL) types allow carryover of unused water up to a point. Increased use of groundwater during dry periods can \nprovide further water security to irrigators with both surface and groundwater licences. Many irrigators already have \nboth surface and groundwater licences, and on-farm storages and infrastructure, and to some extent monitor both \nresources. Historically, additional water in wet years could be accessed through overland flows (floodplain \nharvesting) and announced supplementary flow events. Rules around supplementary water and floodplain \nharvesting are currently in flux. Growth in use is still likely to be restricted and the impacts of rule changes on \ngroundwater recharge are still unclear.  \n \nScenario: MAR for low loss water storage \nMAR could allow greater storage with reduced losses compared to on-farm storages. Storage of water in on-farm \ndams leads to significant evaporative losses and, with climate change, evaporative losses per unit area of water are \nexpected to increase. MAR would be run on single farms by an individual owner or land manager and delivery of \nsurface water would use existing infrastructure with on-farm storages used for temporary storage of MAR water. A \nwater accounting grade estimate of recharge is critical to being confident that MAR provides an advantage over \ninvesting in reducing infiltration “losses”, and to allow an allocation to be issued. As an initial step, MAR pilot studies \ncould work with state government to test water accounting of recharge quantification methods in dedicated trial \ninfiltration basins and test injection wells. Reducing uncertainty about evaporation and recharge rates is critical to \ncomparing MAR as a low loss water storage solution to other evaporation or infiltration reduction alternatives. If \nii \n \nland managers invest in improving understanding of aquifers under their land and quantifying seepage and \nevaporation over time, this will incrementally reduce uncertainty on the effectiveness and viability of MAR. \n \nScenario: Moving water north \nIn the Lower Namoi, there are areas of high drawdown north of Wee Waa that have been subject to trade \nrestrictions, and water salinity tends to increase in the west, especially for the water table aquifer. Increasing \nrecharge north of the river through MAR would involve moving water through existing channel infrastructure for \nrecharge closer to drawdown areas, ensuring that groundwater is available when it is needed and reducing the risk \nof potential regional impacts. The initial use of syndicate channels and existing on-farm storages for temporary \nstaging of MAR water, later supplemented with new infrastructure, requires collaboration between several land \nowners and protocols to determine how benefits, costs and responsibilities would be shared. Regulatory change is \nneeded for recharged water to be accounted for in available water determinations. \nA project to move water north could commence already. Increasing infiltration by selective filling of leaky channels \nor fields does not need approval, and would be approached as pilots with appropriate monitoring to support project \napprovals for new infrastructure and potential water injection. A partnership approach would bring together local \ndata holders, infrastructure owners, regulators and expertise. The project could be set up to have an incremental \nmandate, starting with local data collection, knowledge management and sharing, moving on to supporting \nlandholder water management, and then to development and operation of a larger MAR scheme, similar to that \nalready operating in the Burdekin catchment in Queensland. \n \nScenario: River recharge as MAR \nRiver leakage is a major contributor of recharge in the Lower Alluvium, with recharge increasing when the river is \nhigh or in flood. In principle, river regulation could also target groundwater recharge, raising water levels in reaches \nwith high seepage to not just the water table but also the deeper production aquifer. Managing river recharge would \ninvolve a long-term transition to active self-management by a dedicated cooperative, led by landholders and \noverseen by government. Consensus would need to be reached on operating rules that reflect local context, respond \nto changing environmental circumstances, and target the economic, social and environmental sustainability of local \nirrigation communities without jeopardising downstream outcomes.  \nThis scenario envisions a transformation of river operations, regulations and attitudes to water management but \nacknowledges the potential efficiency of river recharge to deliberately shift water from the surface to underground. \nThe science to support active management is increasingly within reach through methods to identify high recharge \nreaches (which have already been applied in parts of the AOI) and high-resolution remote sensing to monitor and \nmodel the system. Investing in understanding the impact of existing river levels and management on groundwater \nrecharge, and relative contribution of river recharge to recovery of aquifer drawdown, would build capacity to \nmanage river recharge for multiple outcomes.  \nActive self-management of river recharge by collectives of irrigators is a radical change that would require long term \nsocietal and regulatory change. Building the necessary trust, capacity and relationships might need to start with \nother shared endeavours, such as the project described in moving water north.  \n \nCreating an enabling environment for MAR \nStemming from this case study, the general recommendations for CRDC, State government, landholders and/or \nother parties are to:  \n• Build a culture of and capacity for understanding groundwater dynamics at farm scale, and infiltration and \nrecharge at field and channel scale.  \niii \n \n• Invest in pilot studies of MAR that develop regulatory and farm management understanding of recharge \nconsistent with water accounting requirements. \n• Engage in the development of the policy framework for MAR within the NSW strategy to ensure that water \nsharing plan, pilot project, and collective management options remain possible in future. \n• Explore the range of possible paradigms for managing aquifers as reservoirs to minimise impacts and \nmaximise benefits \nA staged approach to operationalising and implementing these recommendations should target initial no-regret \nactions that minimise initial investment and provide value regardless of which management paradigm and MAR \ninnovation are later pursued. In principle, as the value of water increases, telemetry and automation have the \npotential to dramatically increase understanding of an irrigation system, provide savings through condition-based or \npredictive asset maintenance, and in the process yield high resolution understanding of infiltration and evaporation. \nSimilarly, increasing farm data availability increases the benefits of information sharing and greater involvement of \nfarmers and other emerging data holders in regulatory review and development processes. Investing in precision \nagriculture water management could therefore lay the groundwork for MAR in future.  \nAll scenarios developed for the Namoi case study rely on the establishment of organisational structures and research \nand development support that will gradually increase local to subregional hydrogeological understanding. They place \nan emphasis on enhancing the ability of irrigators to evaluate the costs and benefits (in relation to the farm water \nbalance and enterprise resilience) of proposed changes to their operational water management. There is a need for \nmulti-stakeholder efforts to experiment with new regulatory frameworks and policy innovation niches that support \nsustainable irrigation industries. These are changes that would also be desirable more widely to improve capacity for \nwhole-of-system water management in NSW and Australia. MAR is an ideal case to develop this improvement in \ngovernance but would also benefit from investments in improvements through other pathways, such as through \ngreater cooperation in operational water delivery or regional system efficiency improvement mechanisms.  \n \n \n \niv \n \nContents \nExecutive summary ............................................................................................................................................................ i \nBackground .................................................................................................................................................................... i \nOpportunities for MAR in the area of interest ............................................................................................................... i \nThe ‘status quo’ .......................................................................................................................................................... i \nScenario: MAR for low loss water storage ................................................................................................................. i \nScenario: Moving water north .................................................................................................................................. ii \nScenario: River recharge as MAR .............................................................................................................................. ii \nCreating an enabling environment for MAR ................................................................................................................. ii \nFigures ............................................................................................................................................................................... v \nTables ............................................................................................................................................................................. viii \n1.

Introduction \n1.1 The Australian cotton industry \nThe Australian cotton industry is an important sector agriculturally. The majority of the industry is focused in the \nsouth-east, through Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria1. Small areas of cotton production are \npresent in the North of Australia (Western Australia (WA), Northern Territory (NT) and QLD)2. Family-owned farms \ndominate the Australian cotton industry3. The Australian cotton industry is a large exporter, with export earnings of \n$2 million annually4.   \n \n1.2 The implications of water reforms and climate variability on irrigated cotton production \nThe majority of cotton is produced from irrigated systems. In the past, the high water use of the Australian cotton \nindustry attracted criticism, but the industry is now one of the most water efficient cotton industries in the world 5. \nBetween 2002 and 2012, the industry increased yields as a result of improved crop management, advances in plant \nbreeding and the adoption of genetically modified varieties, while being more efficient users of water. These \nchanges improved industry wide water use efficiency (WUE) by 40% (Roth et al., 2014). Select examples of farm \nmanagement changes that led to the observed improvements in WUE, described in The Australian Grown Cotton \nSustainability Report 2014 (Cotton Australia and CRDC, 2014), include:  \n• A 30% increase in the use of soil moisture probes since 2006, which are now used by 70% of irrigators  \n• 96% of furrow irrigation systems have been improved or changed to alternative systems  \n• 49% of irrigators have updated the flow or size of siphons  \n• 35% of irrigators have redesigned fields; for example, decreasing the distance between dams and fields to \nreduce evaporation losses  \nEven after the recent improvements in WUE, irrigated cotton production varies substantially between years (Figure \n1), depending on water volumes available for irrigation (Cotton Australia and CRDC, 2014). The gross value of cotton \nlint is strongly associated with the area of irrigated crop production (Figure 2), decreasing in times of low water \navailability (Cotton Australia and CRDC, 2014). It follows that a key limiting factor on the cotton industry in Australia \nis water security, exacerbated by the potential for further policy changes to water allocations and future climate \nunknowns.    \nOn average, groundwater contributes 15% of water used for the production of irrigated cotton (Cotton Australia and \nCRDC, 2014). In dry periods, dependence on groundwater increases. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) could be used \nin this context by the Australian cotton industry; as a management strategy in the face of future surface water \nscarcity. Is it also possible that MAR has a place in ‘greenfield’ production areas to increase water security from the \nonset of industry development, limiting the unintended water scarcity seen in established regions. \n \n1.3 A brief history of MAR schemes in Australia \nMAR involves the purposeful recharging of aquifers using surface water, whether from rivers and other water bodies \nor recycled water, to be extracted when needed. Overseas MAR has been used to increase water security, with \ninterest in MAR continuing to grow in Australia. MAR projects in Australia date back to the 1960s and the focus of \nthese schemes are mostly urban (Dillon, 2009); MAR remains in its infancy in Australia in an agricultural setting.  \n            \n                                                            \n1 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n2 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n3 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n4 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n5 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n2 \n  \n \n \n \nSouth Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA) are home to the majority of Australia’s MAR schemes (Dillon, 2009). \nThe longest running MAR project in Australia is in Queensland’s Burdekin Delta. The infiltration based system has \nmaintained groundwater levels in the regions, preventing the intrusion of seawater, for decades (Dillon, 2009). \nInfiltration systems have also been used in WA since the 1980s as a way to recycle wastewater to irrigate public \nspaces, including playing fields (Vanderzalm et al., 2015). Multiple regions in SA inject stormwater runoff into \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n3 \naquifers, to be recovered as a water supply for irrigation and industry (Barnett et al., 2000, Miotliński et al., 2014, \nYuan et al., 2016). Several MAR sites around Adelaide (SA) treat stormwater via artificial wetlands before injection \ninto saline aquifers (Barnett et al., 2000). Water recovered as part of this project is of reduced salinity compared to \nthe levels of the native aquifer, and can be used for irrigation purposes (Barnett et al., 2000). The Salisbury aquifer \nstorage treatment and recovery (ASTR) scheme in SA spatially separates injection and recovery wells, allowing for \nthe treatment of injected water during residence in the aquifer (Miotliński et al., 2014, Yuan et al., 2016). Pre-\ninjection artificial wetlands are used to filter out total suspended soils, reducing clogging of wells (Yuan et al., 2016).   \nThe MAR schemes currently operating in Australia show that well-planned projects can be successful. Although \nuptake in agricultural settings is limited, some have suggested that more MAR developments would increase water \nstorage capacity and water security in a way that is economically viable compared to dams and other surface \nstorages (Dillon, 2009, Khan et al., 2008). \n \n1.4 The CRDC MAR Feasibility project \nThe ‘Feasibility study of managed aquifer recharge for improved water productivity for Australian cotton production’ \nproject (here-on-in referred to as the MAR Feasibility project) was funded by the Cotton Research and Development \nCorporation (CRDC) to investigate the feasibility of MAR at a regional scale in established and developing cotton \ngrowing regions in Australia. MAR has been discussed as an option in cotton regions previously, so the MAR \nFeasibility project has focused on whether MAR is a more feasible option then the current or alternate surface water \noptions. Seven feasibility criteria based on those developed by Ticehurst and Curtis (2017) are used in conjunction \nwith scenario development. Further research and resources should be directed to the more feasible options \n(scenarios), whether it be MAR or other water management options. \nThree case study regions were selected in consultation with the project steering committee: the Murrumbidgee \nregion in southern NSW, the Namoi region in northern NSW and the Gilbert region in northern Queensland (Figure \n3). The Namoi and Murrumbidgee regions were selected as representing agricultural settings where the likelihood of \nMAR being feasible should be high, based on what was previously known about these systems across the different \nfeasibility criteria. If the outcomes of these case studies did not support MAR, it would suggest that MAR should be \nruled out as a water management option for the cotton industry. \nThe Lower Namoi is a mature irrigated agriculture region that already makes use of large capacities of farm dams, \nconjunctive surface and groundwater use, and flood water management. In this context, MAR would likely be \nconsidered an attempt to optimise an existing capability rather than an initial attempt at meeting a demand. In \nSection 4, we focus on three key capabilities here relating to ability to store and access water 1) in normal \nconditions, 2) in dry years, and 3) from wet years. Several studies have looked at aspects of MAR feasibility in the \nNamoi valley (Arshad et al., 2012, Arshad et al., 2013, Arshad et al., 2014, Fuentes et al., 2020, Fuentes and Vervoort, \n2020, Rawluk et al., 2013, Woolley et al., 1994). The niche of this case study is that it takes an operational, site \nspecific perspective based on currently available data to develop plausible scenarios for how MAR could work at a \nproperty to sub-regional scale.  \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n4 \n \nFigure 3 Location of the project case study areas. This report focuses on the Namoi case study.  \n \n1.5 Structure of this report \nThe Namoi catchment case study seeks to investigate and resolve some uncertainties associated with MAR at an \noperational level (individual properties to sub-regional scale) in the Lower Namoi (focusing on an area between \nNarrabri and Wee Waa). Past investigations on MAR have  \n• investigated the technical feasibility of MAR at particular locations or potential suitability across the \ncatchment,  \n• compared the cost and benefits of dams, infiltration-based MAR and injection-based MAR in the Lower \nNamoi, and \n• elicited the perspective of irrigators in the Namoi catchment on MAR as a concept.  \nThis report draws on existing investigations and stakeholder expertise to critically assess the potential feasibility of \nMAR in the region and to identify next steps for research and development to guide investment by government or \nother funders. The approach and methods used to assess the feasibility of MAR is provided in Section 2. This is \nfollowed in Section 3 by a description of the Namoi River catchment system and the focus area in the case study. \nThree scenarios representing MAR options are identified and evaluated in Section 0, and discussed in relation to the \nstatus quo of irrigation water management. The development and evaluation of these scenarios drew on the \ndetailed results of the feasibility criteria assessment provided in Section 5. For the final report to be submitted in \nDecember 2021, responses to these scenarios from local engagement (conducted online) will be reported and used \nto revise the scenarios and feasibility assessments. The report concludes in Section 6 with a statement of the \npotential for MAR in the region and recommendations for the CRDC and local and state-level stakeholders going \nforward.  \nGilbert\nNamoi\nMurrumbidgee\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n5 \n2. Overarching approach \nAn argumentation approach has been used to guide the case study development. This reflects the high uncertainty \nin both project requirements and consequences associated with MAR innovations. A staged approach is more \nsuitable in these situations, rather than trying to eliminate all uncertainty in one go. By firstly using available \ninformation to identify whether it’s worth taking the next step in investigating the innovation, strategies that \nincrementally address critical uncertainties around the potential innovation can be identified. In this case study, our \nintent is to identify scenarios that support the hypothesis that MAR could be part of strategy centred on conjunctive \nuse that attempts to optimise the ability to store and access water in normal conditions, in dry years, and from wet \nyears. The questions guiding the 11 steps of the argumentation approach are shown in Figure 4; while represented \nas distinct steps in the diagram the process was highly iterative and underpinned by engagement throughout the \nduration of the case study.  \n \n \nFigure 4 Argumentation approach used to investigate the potential feasibility of MAR in the Gilbert River case study.  \nThe Framing phase identifies what we could achieve in the project, who needed to be convinced of the potential \nviability of MAR (the ‘agents of change’), and what part of the Namoi River catchment we would focus on. With no \nscope to conduct in-depth field research, this project centred on analysis of existing investigations and \nsupplementing these with focused analyses for an area of the Lower Namoi between Narrabri and Wee Waa. Given \nthe mature nature of water policy in NSW and irrigated cropping in the catchment, the project needs to convince \nirrigators that MAR is worth investigating as a financially viable strategy to manage water. This in turn requires \naddressing any concerns around social license, environmental impacts, and the licencing and access of recharged \nwater.  \nIn the Scenario development phase, we developed MAR innovation scenarios and alternate scenarios that do not \nhave a MAR component. These scenarios were supported by a systematic feasibility criteria assessment against the \nseven feasibility criteria of Ticehurst and Curtis (2017): Demand for Water, Water availability, Technical feasibility, \nFinancial viability, Environmental risks, Social acceptability & social license, and Governance arrangements. This \nassessment involved the synthesis of available literature and data for the system. Initial investigations highlighted \nthat the alluvial formations, which are the main groundwater sources for irrigation in the region and are particularly \nrelied upon in dry periods, present the most promising aquifer system for MAR. Groundwater drawdown in these \nformations has been observed in the north-west of the Lower Namoi, indicating the capacity to store significant \nvolumes of water. The work of Fuentes and Vervoort (2020) identified areas adjacent to the Namoi River between \nNarrabri and Wee Waa as being of potential high suitability for MAR. From this, we explored how MAR interventions \nin this Area of Interest (AOI) might work.

Namoi Case Study  \n3.1 Catchment background \nThe Namoi catchment is located within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in northern NSW (Figure 5). The area of the \ncatchment is approximately 42,000 km2 (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020).  \n \nFigure 5 The Murray-Darling Basin with the Namoi catchment shown in red (Source: CSIRO, 2007). \nThe Namoi catchment lie within the traditional lands of the Gomeroi/Kamilaroi Nation 6. The population of the \nNamoi catchment exceeds 100,000 people, with the majority living along the major rivers (Green et al., 2011). \nTamworth is the most populated town in the catchment, having a population of 41,006 people (based on 2016 \ncensus data) 7. Gunnedah, the next largest town, has a population of 9,726 (based on 2016 census data) 8.

Domestic water supply to the towns in the \ncatchment are supplied by the numerous river and creeks.   \nBoth dryland and irrigated agriculture represent a significant proportion of output from the catchment (Green et al., \n2011). Major industries, shown in Figure 6, include livestock, cotton, grain and horticulture (Green et al., 2011). \nCropping is common along the alluvial floodplains of the catchment (Green et al., 2011). Cotton is the main irrigated \ncrop (Green et al., 2011). However, in the long-term there is expected to be a decrease in cotton lint production due \nto an increasing number of +35oC days in the region (Wilson, 2019). Modelling has suggested that of farms in the \nregion do not adapt to climate change their economics are negatively affects and adapting early is beneficial (Wilson, \n2019). Adaptions are not a silver bullet and climate change can be expected to impact farms (Wilson, 2019).   \nLand set aside for conservation makes up over 3% of the catchment. Aside from this land and areas where forestry is \npracticed, much of the native vegetation has been cleared for agriculture, both grazing and cropping (Green et al., \n2011). This widespread clearing combined with poor grazing practices have caused soil degradation and erosion, as \nwell as weed invasion (Green et al., 2011). Although there are no large wetland systems, there are smaller wetlands \nand lagoons, as well as floodplain woodlands, in the Namoi catchment (Green et al., 2011).  \n \nFigure 6 Land use in the Namoi catchment (Source: Green et al., 2011). \n \n3.1.1 Climate \nThe catchment has a large rainfall gradient with upwards of 1,150 mm falling in the east to a little over 400 mm in \nthe west (Figure 7). There is a seasonal pattern to rainfall in the catchment, with highest monthly rainfall common in \nsummer. Similar to rainfall, evaporation rates peak in summer although the spatial trend is reversed with \nevaporation increasing to the west (Figure 8).  \n                                                            \n9 https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC12903?opendocument, accessed 17 Dec \n2020 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n9 \n \nFigure 7 Average annual rainfall map in the Namoi catchment (Source:  BOM, 2008 in DPIE, 2019).  \n \nFigure 8 Average annual evaporation in the Namoi catchment (Source:  BOM, 2008 in DPIE, 2019). \n3.1.2 Geology and soils \nThe Palaeozoic New England Fold Belt, Palaeozoic to Mesozoic Gunnedah Basin, Mesozoic Great Artesian Basin \n(GAB), and unconsolidated sediments and Cenozoic extrusive volcanics comprise the five main surface geological \nunits in the Namoi catchment shown in Figure 9 (DPIE, 2019).

A range of soil types are present in the Namoi catchment (Figure \n10). The heavy black and grey clays, resulting from the volcanic geology, and the alluvial floodplains are commonly \ntargeted for agriculture (Green et al., 2011).   \n \n \nFigure 9 Geology of the Namoi catchment (Source: DPIE, 2019)  \n \n3.1.3 Surface water and groundwater \nThe Namoi River runs west to the outlet of the catchment from the Great Dividing Range, with its major tributaries \nbeing the Mooki, Peel, Manilla, and McDonald Rivers (Figure 11). There are three regulating dams in the catchment: \nKeepit Dam (Namoi River), Split Rock Dam (Manilla River) and Chaffey Dam (Peel River) (Figure 11). The average \nannual flow of the Namoi River at Gunnedah is 696,000 ML (Green et al., 2011), however there is a large amount of \nvariation between years (Figure 12).  \nThe alluvial sediments along the Namoi River (and its tributaries) contain groundwater (Figure 13), which currently \nprovide water for a variety of used including irrigation (Green et al., 2011). In some areas of the Lower Namoi the \nalluvium is up to 120 m deep, producing bore yields in excess of 200 L/sec (Green et al., 2011). In the Upper Namoi \nyields from the alluvium aquifer are lower, ranging from 10 – 40 L/sec (Green et al., 2011). The salinity of \ngroundwater in the Namoi catchment varies spatially (Figure 14). \n \n  \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n11 \n \nhttps://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/assessments/11-\ncontext-statement-namoi-subregion/1121-physical-geography, accessed 18 Dec 2020). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n12 \n \nFigure 11 Rivers and tributaries of the Namoi catchment (Source: Green et al., 2011). \n \nFigure 12 Annual flows in the Namoi River at Gunnedah (Source: Green et al., 2011). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n13 \n \nFigure 13 A simplified representation of the groundwater aquifer types in the Namoi catchment (Source: Green et al., 2011). \n \nFigure 14 Groundwater quality and suitability in the Namoi catchment (Source: Green et al., 2011). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n14 \n3.2 Overview of MAR research in the Namoi \nMAR has been discussed as a water management option in the Namoi catchment for many years, from a variety of \nangles (Arshad et al., 2014, Arshad et al., 2012, Arshad et al., 2013, Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020, Rawluk et al., 2013, \nWoolley et al., 1994). It has been proposed that the large amount of already constructed on-farm surface storages \ncould be used as temporary storages (and sedimentation ponds) before infiltration or injection (Arshad et al., 2014). \nThe channel system could also be used directly for MAR as unlined supply channels could be used to directly to \ninfiltrate water into the below surface aquifer (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020).   \n \nTechnical feasibility \n Woolley et al. (1994) examined the general requirements for artificial recharge in the Namoi and considered \nrepresentative parts of the valley to assess ‘possibly suitable trial sites’: the Mooki River and Quirindi Area in the \nUpper Namoi and two gravel pits in the Lower Namoi Valley. One preferred site for a trial was Borambil Creek at \nQuirindi which would have involved the construction of a low-level sheet pile weir, associated bank stabilisation and \nperiodic maintenance to scrape-up the river bed. An advantage of this was that it could be associated with a town \nwater supply operation. The other preferred site was the gravel pit north-west of Merah North (see Figure 15) which \nhad suitable shallow sand layers in an area located close to a water source. To our knowledge, potential trials in \neither of these sites were not developed any further. The use of a single gravel pit, however, may have limited \npotential for regional-scale MAR given the slow rates of groundwater movement and observed mounding in this part \nof the Namoi system. \nFuentes and Vervoort (2020) used multicriteria decision analysis focused on technical aspects (e.g., slope, distance to \nriver, aquifer characteristics) to produce a suitability map of infiltration (including in-channel) MAR in the Namoi \ncatchment (Figure 16). Their analysis used 10 hydrologic and hydrogeologic criteria (slope, distance to rivers, \ndistance to users, drainage density hydrogeological unit, aquifer Ks, aquifer yield, aquifer salinity, groundwater \ndepth, soil Ks). The areas of highest suitability tend to be close to stream channels.  \n \n \nFigure 15 Location of the gravel pits in the Lower Namoi explored by (Woolley et al., 1994). The box indicates the area of interest for this study \n(see Section 3.3). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n15 \n \n \nFigure 16 Suitability map for infiltration based MAR in the Namoi catchment produced by Fuentes and Vervoort (2020), where high values \nindicate high suitability. The blue arrow is added to highlight an area of high suitability that is the area of interest of this study. \nWater availability \nArshad et al. (2012) assessed water availability for MAR from high streamflow periods (i.e. flood events) in the Lower \nNamoi. It was determined that, on average, once every four years 340 GL of ‘flood’ water was available under the \nwater sharing rules although the large variability associated with floods would need to be factored in during MAR \nplanning and management (Arshad et al., 2012). Fuentes and Vervoort (2020) estimated that 33 GL per day that \nmight be allocated for recharge but that whole event totals may be more important than single day totals. During \none flood event an estimated 240 GL of water exceeded channel limits (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020).  \n \nFinancial viability \nArshad et al. (2013) compared the cost and benefits of dams, infiltration-based MAR and injection-based MAR in the \nLower Namoi. If MAR can be kept below $500/ML it was suggested as a financially viable option (Arshad et al., 2013). \nThe presence of existing on-farm storages in the region was highlighted as a benefit, as these could act as temporary \nstorages for floodwater before infiltration or injection (Arshad et al., 2013).  \nArshad et al. (2014) also compared the cost of surface storage and MAR using both infiltration and injection, looking \nfor crossover points where MAR would no longer be financially viable due to reduction in infiltration rate or increase \nlose, etc. The high capital and water treatment costs of injection, even using existing wells, made this option \nuneconomical compared to surface storage and infiltration-based MAR (Arshad et al., 2014). Although infiltration \nbased MAR was initially more financially worthwhile, a reduction in infiltration rate, increased loss or a drop in \ncotton crop prices all caused the cross over point between surface storages and MAR to be reached, with surface \nstorages becoming more financially viable (Arshad et al., 2014).    \n \nSocial acceptability   \nSharp and Curtis (2012) and Rawluk et al. (2013) assessed the social acceptability of MAR using flood water from the \npoint of view of irrigators. The majority of respondents were in favour of MAR, seeing that MAR has merit, however, \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n16 \nenvironmental impacts, impacts on groundwater quality and the possibility of over-exploitation were all concerns \nraised (Rawluk et al., 2013).  \n  \nGovernance arrangements \nArshad et al. (2012) and Rawluk et al. (2013) both highlighted that the lack of policy and governance systems to \nsupport MAR in NSW was a barrier to MAR in rural settings. As of 2021, pilots for recharge and monitoring can \nalready go ahead with current regulatory frameworks (Ross, 2019), and these are needed to build confidence and \nexpertise and to properly evaluate MAR (Woolley et al., 1994). Whilst MAR policies are not yet in place, there is NSW \ngovernment interest in this space which is an opportunity to ensure in any new policy that rules play to the strengths \nof MAR while minimising associated risk (Guillaume et al., 2020). Essential to any MAR policy is that recovery \nentitlements should be clearly specified and linked to the volume actually recharged, and included in groundwater \nallocation plans (Ross, 2019). Metering and reporting of recharge and recovery is essential to support recovery \nentitlements. \n \n3.3. Area of Interest \nGiven the previous work on MAR in the catchment, this case study takes an operational, site specific perspective \nbased on currently available data. The area of interest (AOI) for our sub-regional analysis is the area of high \nsuitability mapped by (Fuentes et al., 2020) shown in east of the Lower Namoi groundwater source (between \nNarrabri and Wee Waa; blue arrow in Figure 16) 10. This area is part of a highly developed irrigated agriculture \nindustry where cotton is an important irrigated crop. It is located within the Lower Namoi Groundwater Source zone \n(Figure 17), the lower Namoi Regulated River Source (Figure 18) and primarily encompasses the Spring and Bobbiwaa \nCreeks water source under the Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi and Peel Unregulated Rivers Water Sources 2012 \n(Figure 19 Management zones covered by the Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi and Peel Unregulated Rivers Water \nSources 2012). \n \n                                                            \n10 The Upper Namoi Zone 1 (Borambil Creek Groundwater Source) near Quirindi was raised as a possible site on which to focus as it was an \narea where water allocations had been cut by 80%; it was also one of the preferred sites to pilot MAR identified by WOOLLEY, D., FOREST, J., \nGREEN, J., LATTY, K. & WILLIAMS, R. M. 1994. Proposals for Artifical Recharge in the Namoi Valley Department of Water Resources. It was not \nselected as the AOI for this study as there is no irrigated cotton production and the biggest water user, the town of Quirindi (1.5GL), is soon to \nget a pipeline from surface infrastructure. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n17 \n \nFigure 17 Groundwater sources defined in the Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources 2012 11 \n                                                            \n11 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/pdf/map/267559e4-dd5d-4709-ba00-0a8bad2de23e; accessed 13 September 2021 \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n18 \n \nFigure 18 Namoi water management area defined by the Water Sharing Plan for the Upper Namoi and Lower Namoi Regulated River Water Sources 2016 12 \n                                                            \n12 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/image/((Type%3D%22subordleg%22)%20AND%20(No%3D0631)%20AND%20(Year%3D2015)%20AND%20(%22Historical%20Document%22%3D0))/g1.gif; accessed 13 \nSeptember 2021 \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n19 \n \nFigure 19 Management zones covered by the Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi and Peel Unregulated Rivers Water Sources 201213\n                                                            \n13 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/pdf/map/5dbb6137-6ae5-4e3b-98f2-3917304c1152; accessed 13 September 2021 \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n20 \n4.  Scenarios \nThe proposed scenarios were drafted in September 2021 from preliminary feasibility analyses pertaining to MAR in \nthe Namoi catchment and were refined based on preliminary engagement with local stakeholders and experts as \nwell as further assessment of potential feasibility. Note that these scenarios do not constitute an endorsement for a \nparticular course of action. Rather, they highlight possible opportunities for MAR in the Namoi catchment, \ncontrasting these scenarios against the ‘status-quo’ situation.  \n \n4.1 The ‘status quo’ \nThe Lower Namoi is a highly advanced irrigated agriculture region that already makes use of large capacities of farm \ndams, conjunctive surface and groundwater use, and flood water management. Any new water management \nsolution (e.g. managed aquifer recharge) can likely be considered an attempt to optimise an existing capability rather \nthan the first attempt at meeting a need. We focus on three key capabilities here relating to ability to store and \naccess water 1) in normal conditions, 2) in dry years, and 3) from wet years. On-farm water storages are a lynchpin \nto all three conditions, but suffer from high evaporation losses, especially in hot and dry periods. Between years, \nboth general security surface water and groundwater carryover rules allow accumulation of unused water up to a \npoint, beyond which excess carryover is shared with other water users by influencing available water \ndeterminations. Increased use of groundwater during dry periods (and decreased use in wet) provides further water \nsecurity, limited by carryover and groundwater allocations. Accumulation of groundwater allocations is limited by \nrules to avoid excessive drawdown from concentration of pumping, particularly through assessments of trade \napplications. Historically, additional water in wet years could be stored in surface storages or used instead of other \nallocations through overland flows (floodplain harvesting) and announced supplementary flow events. Rules around \nsupplementary water and floodplain harvesting are currently in flux \n14. Growth in use is still likely to be restricted \nand the impacts of rule changes on groundwater recharge are still unclear. Gains from optimising the status quo are \nunlikely to provide new water, but rather to provide greater control over where and when water is available. While \nthere is interest in innovations like MAR, there is an expectation that the benefits would need to be clear in order to \ninvest.  \n \n4.2 MAR for low loss water storage (farm scale) \nMAR could allow greater storage with reduced losses compared to on-farm storages. On-farm storages are already \nused to capture and bank water during wet periods, for example supplementary water or overland flows captured \nthrough floodplain harvesting. Storage of these waters in on-farm dams leads to evaporative losses and, with climate \nchange, losses per unit area of water are expected to increase 15. MAR would be a calculated improvement in water \nbalance and while it comes at the expense of greater pumping costs it has two critical advantages. Firstly, in contrast \nto technologies that keep an existing storage full by reducing evaporation, MAR increases total storage capacity \nthrough use of the aquifer. Secondly, other existing infrastructure could in principle also be used for MAR, e.g. by \ncareful identification of locations of high infiltration and adequately quantifying the resulting recharge. This would \ntie in well with trend towards greater telemetry and automation and the use of remote sensing technologies to \n‘close’ the water balance \n16. While farm-specific cost assessments will be required, as also encouraged by programs \nto foster and enhance farm resilience to drought, MAR is expected to provide financial benefit to irrigators, in part \ndue to reducing costs of energy, but will require care in managing capital and operating costs. It also depends on \n                                                            \n14 See Section 5.7.2 \n15 See Section 5.2.4; FUENTES, I., VAN OGTROP, F. & VERVOORT, R. W. 2020.

Delivery of surface water would follow existing mechanisms, with on-farm storages used for temporary \nstorage of MAR water. Recharge could occur through infiltration basins, channel seepage, controlled field flooding \n(known as “AgMAR”), or injection in existing or new wells 19. Appropriate options depend on local aquifer \ncharacteristics which are highly variable in the Lower Namoi 20. Many irrigators already have both surface and \ngroundwater licences, and on-farm storages and infrastructure, and to some extent monitor both resources. \nRecovery of water would occur through existing wells. Given the similarity of recharged and aquifer water quality, \nlimits on recovery would likely be based on volumes rather than requiring the same water to be recovered as was \nrecharged. \nBoth from a regulatory and farm management perspective, an understanding of recharge consistent with water \naccounting requirements is critical to being confident that MAR provides an improvement in control over the water \nbalance, and to allow an allocation to be issued. Irrigation “return flows” to aquifers or rivers currently contribute to \navailable water determinations, so impacts of MAR from existing infrastructure on water sharing plans may raise \nsome controversy. In the meantime, MAR pilot studies could work with state government to test frameworks for \nregulating MAR in dedicated trial infiltration basins and test injection wells. Perhaps more importantly, land \nmanagers and supporting R&D institutions can already invest in improving understanding of aquifers under their \nland, including high resolution soil mapping, infiltration rates, spatial variation in groundwater level response, and \nquantifying seepage and evaporation over time. Reducing uncertainty about evaporation and recharge rates is \ncritical to comparing MAR as a low loss water storage solution to other evaporation or infiltration reduction \nalternatives. \n \n4.3 Moving water north (regional benefits) \nFrom an aquifer perspective, MAR raises groundwater levels/pressure, and can therefore help counteract negative \nimpacts of overextraction. MAR could be targeted at managing drawdown with the intention of avoiding reductions \nin available water determinations and maintaining flexibility in groundwater trade. Currently, long dry periods with \ngroundwater extractions exceeding the long-term annual extraction limit need to be followed by reductions in \navailable water to maintain long term averages within compliance limits. MAR provides an additional means to \nensure sustainability and manage impacts, including excessive drawdown and worsening water quality. \nIn the Lower Namoi, there are areas of high drawdown north of Wee Waa that have affected the ability to trade, and \nwater salinity tends to increase in the west, especially for the water table aquifer 21. Increasing recharge north of the \nriver through MAR could alleviate concerns regarding drawdown. There are reportedly restrictions to lateral \ngroundwater flow that limit the effect of river recharge, and vertical recharge is insufficient to support current levels \nof pumping, leading to an increased hydraulic gradient in the region. MAR would involve moving water through \nexisting channel infrastructure for recharge closer to drawdown areas, ensuring that groundwater is available when \nit is needed and reducing the risk of potential regional impacts. \nFurther investigation of the magnitude and distribution of benefits of reduced drawdown is needed to determine \nhow costs and responsibilities would be shared. While moving water north appears to be possible, it would make use \nof syndicate channels and existing on-farm storages for temporary staging of MAR water, and therefore require \n                                                            \n17 https://dpie.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-and-programs/nsw-water-strategy/the-strategy, accessed 27 September 2021 \n18 See Section 5.7.3 \n19 See Section 5.3.5 \n20 See Section 5.3.2 \n21 See Section 5.3.3 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n22 \ncollaboration between several land owners (including neighbouring dryland farmers). Similarly to MAR for low loss \nwater storage, this is potentially an opportunity, however, to gradually optimise regional water operations, providing \na project context in which infiltration and possible recharge from shared channel infrastructure can be investigated, \nand any concerns about pumping reliability can be tackled together. Initial work using existing infrastructure can be \nsupplemented by new channel capacity and new injection or infiltration facilities as understanding of the aquifer and \nrecharge mechanisms improves. \nWhile regulatory change is needed for recharged water to be accounted for in available water determinations, a \nMAR project to move water north could begin now already. This would involve a stocktake of current \nhydrogeological knowledge about recharge in the area of drawdown and of impacts and potential benefits of \nalleviating that drawdown. Farm water data (e.g. telemetry) can inform estimates of seepage and information \nsharing about groundwater levels/pressure and soil properties could help complete state long-term monitoring \nrecords to achieve the high spatial and temporal resolution aquifer understanding that is essential in a spatially \nvariable system like the Lower Namoi Alluvium. A partnership approach would be adopted to bring together local \ndata holders, infrastructure owners, regulators, and expertise. Increasing infiltration by selective filling of leaky \nchannels or fields does not need approval, and would be approached as pilots with appropriate monitoring to \nsupport project approvals for new infrastructure and potential water injection. The project could be set up to have \nan incremental mandate, starting with local data collection, knowledge management and sharing, moving on to \nsupport landholder water management, and then to development and operation of a larger MAR scheme, similar to \nthat already operating in the Burdekin catchment in Queensland. \n \n4.4 River recharge as MAR (transformative change) \nRiver leakage is a major contributor of recharge in the Lower Alluvium, with recharge increasing when the river is \nhigh or in flood. The river is already regulated by both weirs and upstream dams, with Mollee Weir acting as a site of \nenhanced recharge. In principle, river regulation could also target groundwater recharge, raising water levels in \nreaches with high seepage to not just the water table but also the deeper production aquifer. This would be a major \nchange in terms of river operations, attitude to surface water, and regulatory context, but if the aim of MAR is to \nmove surface water to aquifers, then the potential efficiency of river recharge cannot be discounted. \nIn the current context, it is envisaged that managing river recharge would involve a long-term transition to active \nself-management by a dedicated cooperative, led by landholders and overseen by government. River recharge \ndeparts sufficiently from traditional river operations that it would likely be instigated by a grass roots farmer \norganisation that reaches critical mass in both understanding of the system and support for the scheme for \ngovernment to support a change in governance and management arrangements, radically revisiting existing rules, \nincluding permitting the potential development of new infrastructure on Crown land. The required level of \nunderstanding of the local river system can likely only by achieved by a local dedicated organisation. Consensus \nwould need to be reached on operating rules that reflect local conditions, environmental circumstances and target \nthe sustainability (economic, social, and environment) of local irrigation communities without jeopardising \ndownstream outcomes. \nSimilar to how the other scenarios recognise channel “losses” as potential recharge, river “losses” would be \nrecognised as contributing to local groundwater availability, with the associated groundwater system supporting \nboth economic and environmental outcomes. Where currently river losses are accepted as part of delivery of high \nsecurity, general security and supplementary water, and for irrigation, town, and environmental use, a sufficiently \nadvanced local understanding and supporting regulating infrastructure would allow varying those losses over time, \ndecreasing recharge to increase delivery efficiency of pulses of water, and increasing recharge at other times. The \nrules for this kind of recharge are far from being drafted, but a possible precedent would be to treat the reaches \naffected as a regulated system with a conveyance license to be managed by the responsible organisation. The \nscience to support active management is increasingly within reach. Geophysics and other analyses have already \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n23 \nbegun to identify high recharge reaches 22. High resolution remote sensing provides unprecedented ability to \nmonitor and model the system. Confidence in ability to manage river recharge for multiple outcomes could be \nenhanced by investigation of the impact of existing river levels and management on groundwater recharge, and \nrelative contribution of river recharge to recovery of aquifer drawdown. \nThe fact remains that active self-management of river recharge by collectives of irrigators is a radical change that \nwould require long term societal and regulatory change. Previous studies suggest that collective management is \nsupported in the region \n23, although river recharge has not specifically been investigated and would likely be \nparticularly controversial. It might be that the necessary trust, capacity, and relationships do not start with the river, \nbut rather other shared endeavours, such as the project described in moving water north. With a sufficiently \nsophisticated understanding of local hydrogeology, ultimately such a collective might not stop at the river, with \nmanagement of recharge in the floodplain and tributaries potentially also yielding benefits. Working towards \nmanaging river recharge is then also symbolic of a desire to ensure that surface and groundwater are regulated \ntogether in the region, rather than apart. \n                                                            \n22 FUENTES, I. & VERVOORT, R.

Feasibility Criteria Analysis \nThis section presents the data, information, analysis and assumptions that have been made in order to inform the \npotential feasibility across the seven criteria outlined in Table 1 of the four scenarios presented in Section 4. An \noverview of key points for each scenario and feasibility criteria is given in Table 2. \nTable 1 The seven feasibility criteria of Ticehurst and Curtis (2017). \nCriteria Example questions and considerations \nDemand for \nWater \n• Is there demand for more water, or a greater water security? \n• Who wants the water and when? \nWater \navailability \n• Is water available to be banked underground (e.g. unused surface water shares, surface water traded \nin when prices are low)? \nTechnical \nfeasibility \n• Is there space in the aquifer systems to store surface water for drier times? \n• How can the water be recharged, stored and extracted? \nFinancial \nviability \n• Financial viability and profitability of MAR schemes are influenced by many factors including the MAR \ntype, water source, infiltration and recovery rates, groundwater depth, water markets, crop prices \nand yields, groundwater pumping costs  \nEnvironmental \nrisks \n• Are there any significant effects on water quality & quantity (positive or negative)? \n• What are the consequential impacts of any change on farm land and ecosystems? \nSocial \nacceptability \n• Is it a socially acceptable option to irrigators, stakeholders and the wider community? \n• What are people's values, knowledge and beliefs about MAR? \n•  Do they perceive risks about its implementation in their region? \nGovernance \narrangement \n• Are the legislative and policy settings appropriate to support a MAR system?  \n• If not, how would they need to be changed?  \n \n5.1 Effective demand for products \nThe Lower Namoi is a mature irrigated agricultural region that already makes use of large capacities of farm dams, \nconjunctive surface and groundwater use, and flood water harvesting. In this context, MAR would likely be \nconsidered an attempt to optimise an existing capability rather than an initial attempt at meeting a demand. In \nSection 4, we focus on three key capabilities here relating to ability to store and access water 1) in normal \nconditions, 2) in dry years, and 3) from wet years. To assess the effective demand for these capabilities, we first \nexplore the variability in surface water allocations (Section 5.1.1) and groundwater extractions (Section 5.1.2)  in the \nLower Namoi then consider irrigation industry demand for water (Section 5.1.3). \n \n5.1.1 Variability of surface water allocations in the Lower Namoi \nThe historic allocation volume announcements for general security water allocation licences (WAL) within the Lower \nNamoi Regulated River Source (Figure 20) illustrates that this is not a secure source of water in the region. In three of \nthe 15 years, allocations exceeded the sum of the licenced share component but are 31% or less in all other years; \nzero allocations were announced in 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2018-19. Other consumptive WAL types are reliable but \nare not of large volumes (see Section 5.2.2, page 28). \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n25 \nTable 2 Summary of the scenario feasibility. \nScenario Status quo MAR for low water loss storage Moving water north River recharge as MAR \n1.  Effective \ndemand for \nproducts \nExisting sophistication means that \nremaining options for increasing water \nsecurity or supply tend to be experimental, \nrisky, expensive, or facing diminishing \nreturns. \nHigh value of water and traditional water sources \nand storage options already tapped, leading to \ninterest in complementary strategies [5.6.2] \nExisting drawdown is considered a risk factor, with trade \nlimited. Distribution of benefits from alleviating \ndrawdown needs further investigation. \nUbiquitous groundwater use with near full \nutilisation of groundwater dry periods, which \nmanaging recharge could tackle. \n2.  Water \navailability \nFully allocated system, with any significant \ngrowth in use of existing allocations also \nlikely to be limited, and retention of \ncarryover likely to come at expense of \navailable water determinations. \nRedirection of existing surface water allocations \nfrom on-farm storages to infiltration or injection \ninto the aquifer \nWater drawn from existing surface water entitlements \nat low cost times (possibly purchased by a consortium) \nwith intention that it replaces groundwater extracted at \nhigh cost times. \nRadical change in water management that could \nstart by treating current river “losses” as a \nconveyance water allocation \n3. Technical \nfeasibility \nExisting infrastructure able to handle both \nsurface and groundwater, including flood \nmanagement [5.3.1].  \nHigh ability to move water across the area \nof interest. \nInfrastructure exists for delivery and temporary \nstorage of MAR water [5.3.1].  \nRecharge dependent on highly spatially variable \nhydrogeological conditions [5.3.2]. \nOptions include infiltration basins, injection, \nchannel infiltration, and field AgMAR [5.3.7]. \nPotential to start with existing irrigation infrastructure \nto move water north and recharge by increasing water \nresidence times and levels. Project assessments and \napprovals would inform new MAR infrastructure \ndevelopment. \nLarge portion of recharge comes from river and is \ndependent on flow levels. Existing geophysics and \nother analyses have started identifying high \nrecharge areas. \n4. Financial \nviability \nFinancial performance dependent on \nclimate, but in general capital is available for \nfurther developments. \nNeed to calculate farm-specific benefits from \nreduced evaporation and greater storage capacity, \ndependent on evaporation and recharge rates, and \non cost management [\n5.4].  \nPossibility for collaboration to reduce shared costs. \nRegional benefits of coordinated recharge management \nare difficult to estimate, but expected to arise from \ngreater reliability of groundwater supply from lower \ndrawdown and reduced water quality risks. Seek to \nshare R&D costs. \nTransformative change that provides greater \ncontrol over groundwater availability during \ndrought. Partnership approach would be needed \nto share initial R&D costs, with new infrastructure \nsubject to case-specific cost-benefit analysis. \n5. Environmental \nrisk \nContinuing pressure on health of Barwon-\nDarling system [5.5.2]. \nRisks for downstream environment and \nlocal groundwater dependent ecosystems \nexpected to be managed by existing \nregulation [5.5.2, 5.5.4]. \nLimited additional risk to ecological communities \ngiven existing use of surface water storages and \nallocations and licensing conditions [5.5.4].  \nRisks of aquifer contamination would be managed \n[5.5.4, 5.7.1]. \nRisks of waterlogging would be explicitly managed, and \nmanagement of drawdown would consider potential \nenvironmental benefits. \nEnvironmental management objectives would \nneed to be part of consensus on operating rules \nand government oversight, with potential for \nriver management to also contribute to \nenvironmental outcomes. \n6. Social \nacceptability \nOpenness to new options given high policy \npressure on use of existing water sources. \nNeed for ‘visibility’ of stored water, with clear \nmonitoring. Could build on improving \nunderstanding of water balance. \nFurther analysis of the distribution of costs and benefits \nwould be needed to make a case for cooperation [5.63] \nSharp & Curtis (2012) identified support for \ncollective groundwater management, though \ndirect management of the river is expected to be \ncontroversial and current uncertainty is likely a \nbarrier. \n7. Governance \narrangements \nDriven by state government with freedom \nto operate within allocations and other \nlicensing conditions. Supporting industry \ngroups, but limited other existing structures \nfor collective self-management. \nDependent on policy framework for MAR currently \nbeing developed under NSW Water Strategy but \nmonitoring of infiltration and rules for recovery \nare essential [5.7.4]. \nWould benefit from information sharing for high \nresolution understanding of groundwater system. \nInitial development possible now, but best wrapped in a \nproject approval process for further work. Collaboration \nand coordination essential and would be considered a \nco-benefit. \nSDL compliance is currently only based on actual take \nand would need to be altered to account for recharge \nand/or drawdown.  \nWould probably require local initiation of \ncollective management and has precedents \nelsewhere in Australia. This would be a radical \nchange that would likely require building trust, \nknowledge, and relationships over many years, \npossibly starting with less ambitious recharge \nmanagement efforts. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n26 \n5.1.2 Groundwater extractions in the Lower Namoi \nUnder the Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources 2020, the long-term average annual \nextraction limit (LTAAEL) for the Lower Namoi Groundwater Source is 88,255 ML/year 24. This limit is a roughly 20 GL \nreduction from the nearly 105 GL limit in 2006-07, and to offset reduced allocations supplementary shares were \ntemporarily made available from 2006-07 to 2014-14 to offset reduced allocation (Figure 21). In most years, \nextraction from the resource is close to or exceeds the extraction limit 25. This plot indicates the heavy reliance on \ngroundwater in the Namoi, which is only moderated in wet periods.  \n \n \nFigure 20 Cumulative total allocation volume (ML) for each water year within the Regulated River (General Security) licence category in the \nLower Namoi Regulated River Source (blue columns) in relation to the sum of the licenced share component (volume of water in ML) for this \nlicence type (Source: https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/allocations-availability/water-accounting/historical-available-water-\ndetermination-data) \n \n \nFigure 21 Historic supplementary share component in the Lower Namoi Groundwater Source (Source: \nhttps://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/allocations-availability/water-accounting/share-component-dashboard, 14 September 2021) \n                                                            \n24 Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources Order 2020, \nhttps://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2020-0346#sec.24, accessed 15 September 21 \n25 If the five-year average of extractions exceed the LTAAEL by more than 5% (the compliance trigger), the maximum water \naccount debits or available water determinations will be used to return the average extraction volume to the LTAAEL (Source: \nhttps://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/312968/namoi-alluvial-groundwater-sources-2020-rule-\nsummary-sheets.pdf, accessed 14 September 2021) \n0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\n250000\n300000\n350000Cumumative allocation  (ML) \nAllocated volume (ML) Number of 1ML shares\n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n27 \n \nFigure 22 Lower Namoi groundwater extraction compared to the extraction limit compliance trigger (Source: \nhttps://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/353192/lower-namoi-groundwater-source-2020.pdf, accessed 15 September \n2021)26 \n \n5.1.3 Irrigator demand for water \nThere is a high level of irrigation development in the Namoi catchment, with cotton being an important irrigated \ncrop (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020, Arshad et al., 2013, Arshad et al., 2012). Groundwater resources in the Namoi are \nthe most intensively developed in the state, with up to half of water used within the catchment extracted from \ngroundwater sources (CSIRO, 2007). 547 bores with the purpose of production are registered across the Lower \nNamoi Groundwater Source (DPIE, 2020a).  In dry periods when surface water supplies are low farmers in the region \n(who have both surface and groundwater entitlements) depend heavily on their groundwater allocations 27 (Figure \n22).  \n \n5.2 Water availability for MAR \nPrevious MAR assessments have highlighted flood or high flow events as a possible water source for MAR in the \nNamoi catchment (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020, Arshad et al., 2012). During flood events it was estimated that 33 GL \nper day could be recharged and it is common for flood events in the area to last for multiple days (Fuentes and \nVervoort, 2020). For example, during one flood event 240 GL of water was recorded as exceeding the channel limit \n(Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). Arshad et al. (2012) estimated that 340 GL of water may be available once every four \nyears as a result of high streamflow events, under the allocation rules in place at that time.  \nUnder the Water Sharing Plan for the Upper Namoi and Lower Namoi Regulated River Water Sources 2016 (2015 SI \n631) the types of water allocation licences (WAL) in the Upper and Lower Namoi are stock and domestic, local water \nutility, high security, general security and supplementary water. High and general security entitlements vary based \non water availability, with the former much more reliable than the latter (CSIRO, 2007). In the Namoi And Peel \nUnregulated Rivers Water Sources 2012, the types of WAL are domestic and stock, domestic and stock (stock) and \nunregulated river. \n                                                            \n26 Note legend for black line should read 5-year average annual extraction  \n27 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-12/cotton-farmer-defends-water-use-as-namoi-river-runs-dry/11104440, accessed 10 \nJuly 2021 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n28 \n5.2.1 Water allocation licences (WAL) in the AOI \nThe breakdown of WAL in the AOI shows that general security and supplementary entitlements comprise the \nmajority of water entitlements (Table 3).  \nTable 3 Breakdown of water allocation licences (WAL) in the AOI \nSource WAL type # of unique licences Total 1 ML shares \nLower Namoi Regulated \nRiver Water Source \nHigh security 2 150 \nHigh security [Research] 1 486 \nGeneral security 15 95,010 \nDomestic & Stock 11 216 \nSupplementary 25 36,225.4 \nLower Namoi Groundwater \nSource Aquifer 12 15,191 \n \n5.2.2 Historic take in the Lower Namoi by WAL type \nHistoric take of surface water in the following section are freely available from the WaterNSW WaterInsights portal \nfor the Lower Namoi Regulated River Water Source (which includes the AOI). \n \nSecure water licences \nDomestic and stock, high security and local water utility licence types are all secure water, where an allocation of \n100% will usually be made at the start of the water year. For these entitlements, carryover is not allowed and the \nwater allocated in a water year will never exceed 100% of the entitlement.28 The historic take of secure water licence \nin the Lower Namoi Regulated River Source is shown in Figure 23. \n12 high security water allocation licenses (WAL) from the Lower Namoi Regulated River source exists. The majority of \n1 ML shares (3000) are held by one WAL, whilst another WAL with 486 shares is listed as High Security (Research). It \nis unlikely that stock and domestic or high security licenses would be banked because their current supply is already \nvery secure. Given that high security licenses cannot be carried over, MAR could in theory provide an opportunity for \nhigh security water to effectively be carried over. However, the volumes are very small (particularly in the AOI; see \nTable 3) and MAR is not likely to provide a financially viable option for the irrigators with these entitlements.  \n \n \nFigure 23 Historic take of secure water licence in the Lower Namoi Regulated River Source (Source: \nhttps://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/11986-lower-namoi-regulated-river/research, 14 September 2021) \n                                                            \n28 https://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/11986-lower-namoi-regulated-river/rules, accessed 14 September 2021 \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21\nVolume (GL)\nDomestic & stock (DS) High Security Research (HSR) High security (HS) Local water utility (LWU)\nNumber of 1ML shares (DS) Number of 1ML shares (HSR) Number of 1ML shares (HS) Number of 1ML shares (LWU)\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n29 \nSupplementary entitlements \nUnder current arrangements in rural agriculture regions like the Namoi, water available for MAR is scarce (Arshad et \nal., 2012). Supplementary water allocations, available during period of high streamflow/flooding, have been \nsuggested as a possible MAR water source in regulated river systems (Arshad et al., 2012). Current water policy \nencourage the use of on-farm dams to store any captured supplementary allocations (Arshad et al., 2012). On-farm \ndams, although common throughout the region, have obvious drawbacks, for example, losses due to evaporation \nand seepage (Arshad et al., 2012). One positive of using supplementary flows in the Lower Namoi is that \nenvironmental flows, which serve ecological purposes, are able to be satisfied alongside extraction due to the large \nflows available at the time of the flood event (Arshad et al., 2012) and the rules in place (see Section 5.7.2, p74Water \nSharing Plans (WSP) covering the AOI). Beyond the rules of the applicable Water Plan, the nature of the flood event \n(single day vs. multiday), the presence of any additional water restrictions and the account balance of \nsupplementary licences (i.e., is this the first high streamflow event of the year or the 7th) would all impact \nsupplementary water availability. The Lower Namoi has a large number of unit shares to extract water using \nsupplementary water access licences 29, totaling 115.5 GL although the full supplementary entitlement has never \nbeen used to date (Figure 24). Actual allowable takes are prescribed by clause 48 of the Upper Namoi and Lower \nNamoi Regulated River Water Sources 2016 and ensure that only a certain percentage of supplementary event water \nvolumes can be taken (see Section 5.7.2). The historic availability and take of supplementary events for the river \nsections crossing the AOI are compiled in Table 4. \n \n \nFigure 24 Historic take of supplementary licence in the Lower Namoi Regulated River Source (Data source: \nhttps://waterregister.waternsw.com.au/water-register-frame, 16 September 2021) \nTable 4 Historic supplementary events and usage along the river sections crossing the AOI compiled from General Purpose Water Accounting \nReports (available at https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/allocations-availability/water-accounting/gpwar, accessed 25 November 2021) \nWater \nyear \nNamoi River (Narrabri to Mollee Weir) Namoi River (Mollee Weir to Gunidgera Weir) \n# of calls Total days Usage (ML) # of calls Total days Usage (ML) \n2010-11 6 81 206.7 6 81 30487 \n2011-12 3 83 328 3 83 16678 \n2012-13 3 27 301 4 28 12066 \n2013-14 NA NA NA NA NA NA \n2014-15 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n2015-16 0 0 0 4 13 5831 \n2016-17 2 43 237 3 58 22905 \n2017-18 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n2018-19 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n2019-20 2 17 0 1 2 1275 \n                                                            \n29 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0631#sec.25, accessed 19 July 2021 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2019-20 2020-21\nVolume (GL)\nUsage YTD (GL) Water made Available (GL)\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n30 \nGeneral security entitlements \nThe IQQM long-term simulations suggest the General Security water availability (carryover plus available water \ndetermination) will be 200% for 9% of the time and 100% for 44% of the time at the start of the season and that by \nthe end of the water year water availability would equal or exceed 100% for 73% of the time (Burrell et al., 2021). \nThe incremental available water determination for general security is shown in Figure 25 as a proportion of the share \ncomponent, illustrating the recent conditions have the lowest water availability since WSP management \ncommenced. Availability was so low that temporary water restrictions were applied for the 2019-20 reporting period \n(Table 5), where take of water was negligible (Figure 26).  \nThe current carryover system is a method of purposely saving water to be used in the future, where licence holders \nare able to carryover saved water entitlements from one year to the next (for up to three years). In this way, the \ncarryover of surface water entitlements from past years has been used to ride out the times when entitlements have \nbeen severely reduced  \n30. This is a similar concept to one that could be implemented using MAR, with the difference \nbeing that instead of surface water being kept large in-stream storages carryover water would be recharged to be \nused later. Depending on the rules around recovery of stored water, MAR might mitigate the risk of the recent \nrestrictions applied to carryover. However, this WAL type might not be a desirable source of water for MAR from an \nirrigator perspective (See Section 5.6.3, page 69). \n \nFigure 25 Incremental available water determination (AWD) for Lower Namoi general security as a proportion of share component (Burrell et \nal., 2021) \n \nFigure 26 Historic take of general security licence in the Lower Namoi Regulated River Source (Data source: \nhttps://waterregister.waternsw.com.au/water-register-frame, 16 September 2021) \n                                                            \n30 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-12/cotton-farmer-defends-water-use-as-namoi-river-runs-dry/11104440, accessed 10 \nJuly 2021 \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n2004-05 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21\nVolume (GL)\nWater made Available (GL) Usage (GL) Total Share Component\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n31 \nUnregulated river licences \nThe water source encompassing the AOI for this study is the Spring and Bobbiwaa Creek water source (see Figure \n19).

This restriction was in effect from 18 October 2019 until 30 June 2020.  \n• A temporary water restriction was placed on all water held in general security carryover accounts in the Lower \nNamoi. This restriction was in place from 1 July 2019 until 25 February 2020, when it was repealed when conditions \nimproved.  \n• Under the Northern Basin restrictions, from 17 January to 13 February high security access in the Lower Namoi was \nnot permitted and unregulated river access until 21 February (with some limited exemptions). Floodplain harvesting \naccess was restricted from 7 February to 21 February for the Upper Namoi floodplain and 23 February for the mid \nNamoi and Lower Namoi floodplains.  \nExtreme events stage \n• The Lower Namoi started the water year in stage 4 critical. The valley was eased to stage 3 severe in March 2020 and \nremained in that stage for the remainder of 2019–20. Storage inflows to Keepit were below average for all months \nexcepting February 2020 (Figure 28).  \n• No releases were able to be made from Keepit Dam for most of the water year due to extremely limited storage \nresources. Dam levels began to rise in February and a small release was made in March 2020 to supply users close to \nthe dam with stock and domestic water. For all other users, access was only available from tributary inflows \ndownstream of Keepit dam.  \n• Looking at 2-year natural storage inflow (removing impact of Split Rock transfers), as an indicator of drought severity \nsequences to Keepit Dam between 1961 and current, illustrates that the period between 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2020 \ntotalled 71,221 megalitres, and was the lowest 2-year period in this timeframe. This inflow total was 84% lower than \nthe median two year  \n \n5.2.3 Floodplain harvesting \nFloodplain harvesting is the capture of overland flow water (e.g. including floodwater and rainfall runoff); from the \noutset of water management under WSP, provisions were made to create flood harvesting licences but these have \nnot yet been implemented (see Section 5.7.3 for more detail). In 2012, based on available models, an estimated \nvolume of 210 GL/yr of floodplain harvesting occurred across the northern Basin (both QLD and NSW). The NSW \nDPIE note that the information used to develop this estimate was poor and the river system models used were not \ndeveloped to be used to make some estimate and the expectation is that this number will change with improved \ndata and models 31. The NSW Government is currently developing valley-specific, peer-reviewed technical reports \nwhich describe the modelling process and the data being used to re-estimate these legal limits; the first report \navailable being the Border Rivers valley 32.  \nThe Namoi Valley report and estimate of floodplain harvesting volumes is not yet available. However, in their \nsubmission to the draft NSW Floodplain Harvesting Policy May 2010, Namoi Water noted that many of their 800+ \n                                                            \n31 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/about/impact-of-floodplain-harvesting-\ngrowth-in-the-northern-basin, accessed 16 September 2021 \n32 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/about/impact-of-floodplain-harvesting-\ngrowth-in-the-northern-basin, accessed 16 September 2021 \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n32 \nvoluntary members depended financially on access to floodplain flows, particularly due to droughts and cutbacks to \nother water access, and that this history of access extended back to the 1960’s 33. \n \n5.2.4 Evaporation losses \nOn-farm water storages are popular in the cotton industry and in the Namoi catchment (Arshad et al., 2013) as they \nare relied upon to store excess water available during high periods (Arshad et al., 2012). However, the high \nevapotranspiration rates in the area, when compared to rainfall, further strains water availability. Evaporative water \nlosses from surface storages popular throughout the region, and the Murray-Darling Basin more generally, are high \n(Arshad et al., 2013).  \nFuentes et al. (2020) used supervised classification of Landsat images between 1988 and 2018 together with climate \ntrends based on month SILO gridded to explore long-term surface water trends and relationship with open water \nevaporation losses in the Namoi catchment, Australia. They generally found an increasing trend in the number of \nfarm dams over this time period as well as increased reference evapotranspiration and evaporation per unit area of \nwater. Annual evaporative losses averaged 201.9 GL, which Fuentes et al. (2020) noted is greater than the annual \ntotal account usage of surface water in the catchment. The authors conclude that there is evidence of “a loss of blue \n[freshwater in lakes, rivers and aquifers] and green [soil] water in the catchment, and … of an overall intensification \nof the hydrologic cycle as predicted under climate change”.  \nThe current extent of evaporative losses and increasing trend per unit of area provide an argument for using MAR as \na strategy to reduce losses (see Section 4.2) although was not considered a critical concern by a local irrigator (see \nSection 5.6.3).  \n \n5.3 Technical feasibility \nThis section is structured to provide information on the surface water infrastructure that could support MAR \n(Section 5.3.1), aquifer characteristics (Section 5.3.2), groundwater levels (Section 5.3.3), groundwater salinity \n(Section 5.3.4), soil characteristics (Section 5.3.5) and recharge (Section 5.3.6) which is needed to inform the design, \nplanning and implementation of MAR strategies (Section 5.3.7).  \n \n5.3.1 Surface water infrastructure to support MAR \nOn-farm dams and intricate channel infrastructure are abundant throughout the Lower Namoi (Figure 27) and the \nAOI (Figure 28) of this study. This is to support the widespread irrigated agriculture industry in the region. There are \nalso multiple large in-stream surface storages in the Namoi catchment, including Split Rock Dam and Keepit Dam 34. \nHowever, Namoi Water note the reliance upon farm dams as the river operator is unable to provide continuous flow \nand that (depending on availability) the water delivered from regulated storages needs to last the farmer for up to 3-\n6 months 35. These storages are used to store multiple sources of water: rainfall, used agricultural water, overland \nflow, floodplain harvesting, groundwater, supplementary water, unregulated water and general security 36. \nOfftakes from the Namoi River that would supply the canal system were identified via aerial imagery (Figure 29). It is \npossible that not all offtakes were captured using this method.  \nThe canal system could be used to transport water to be recharged to MAR sites. The dams present in the area could \nbe used as temporary storages before recharge. The temporary storage of water would be particularly important if \nMAR water would be sourced from flood waters. This would allow for infiltration or injection rate limitations to be \novercome, as more water could be diverted for recharge then what could be recharged during the limited flood \nperiod.    \n                                                            \n33 https://namoiwater.com.au/bakeehom/2020/05/Namoi-Water-floodplain-policy-10528-2.pdf, accessed 16 September 2021 \n34 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2015-0631, accessed 19 July 2021 \n35 https://namoiwater.com.au/, accessed 24 November 2021 \n36 https://namoiwater.com.au/, accessed 24 November 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n33 \n \nFigure 27 Stream, canals and dams in Lower Namoi groundwater zone (Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (AHGF) \n(https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/australian-hydrological-geospatial-fabric-geofabric)).  \n \nFigure 28 Stream, canals and dams in the area of interest (Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (AHGF) \n(https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/australian-hydrological-geospatial-fabric-geofabric)). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n34 \n \nFigure 29 Offtakes of the Namoi River in the area of interest.

Offtakes were identified from \naerial imagery and not all may be identified. \n \n5.3.2 Aquifer characteristics \nAlluvial aquifer characteristics \nThe major near surface formations in the area are termed the Narrabri, Gunnedah and Cubbaroo (Fuentes and \nVervoort, 2020) 37 and are comprised mainly of alluvial sediments up to 120 m in depth (Arshad et al., 2012). These \nare the main groundwater sources for irrigation in the region (Arshad et al., 2014, CSIRO, 2007, Rassam et al., 2013). \nThe shallow Narrabri Formation (Figure 30) is an unconfined aquifer that can be up to 70 m deep but is typically 30 \nto 40 m deep 38. It contains distinct sand/gravel paleochannels 39 amongst the floodplain silts and clays. \nTransmissivities in this aquifer system are less than 250 m2/day (Arshad et al., 2014). Recharge of this aquifer occurs \nvia seepage from stream/river channels, overbank flooding and rainfall infiltration (CSIRO, 2007). Infiltration from \nthe Narrabri Formation recharges the underlying Gunnedah Formation (CSIRO, 2007) which is comprised of \nmoderately well-sorted sands and gravels with minor clay beds up to 70m depth and in some parts acts as a single \naquifer with the Narrabri Formation 40. The Cubbaroo formation is a confined aquifer associated with the main \npaleochannel in the central and northern parts of the valley.  \n                                                            \n37 The Narrabri, Gunnedah and Cubbaroo formations are a useful way to reference upper and lower portions of the alluvial \nsequence only, and are used by many to describe the aquifers in the region. Other possible naming conventions for the aquifers \nin the region include the simple ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ delineation.  \n38 https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/assessments/11-context-statement-namoi-subregion/1141-hydrostratigraphic-\nunits, accessed 16 September 2021 \n39 Although commonly referred to as paleochannels, the sandy areas in the region are lateral accretions, which form from the \nsideways migration of the meandering rivers (Dr. Bryce Kelly, pers. comm. December 2020). For consistency with past research \nin the Namoi, the term paleochannel will be used in this report.  \n40 https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/assessments/11-context-statement-namoi-subregion/1141-hydrostratigraphic-\nunits, accessed 16 September 2021 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n35 \n \nFigure 30 Diagram of groundwater system in the Namoi catchment (Source: URS Australia Pty Ltd (2007)) \nMany of the deposits that form alluvial aquifers in the region have a clay layer which reduces hydraulic connectivity  \nto the underlying aquifers (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). Aryal et al. (2018) estimated the vertical conductivity of the \nNamoi alluvium, for use in the bioregional assessment Namoi groundwater model for 347 nested piezometer sites \nwith between two to six piezometers. The linear trend in groundwater levels was calculated for the 30-year period \nand the maximum difference in the slope of the trend line between piezometers in the same nest was recorded. \nNoting that the simplistic analysis ignores stresses such as irrigation, Aryal et al. (2018) assumed poor vertical \nconnections if there were significant differences in the water level trends at a nested site. These point data were \nkriged to the alluvium boundary to create the spatial layer of the difference in groundwater level in Figure 31.  \nKelly et al. (2007) notes the heterogeneity of the system and that the preceding alluvial sequence under-represents \nthe complexity in that the dominant sediments in each formation (sand, gravel, clay) vary spatially, which means that \nthe hydraulic parameters and flow pathways within the alluvial aquifer sequence are hard to conceptualise. This \ncomplexity was demonstrated by Blakers et al. (2011) who used hierarchical clustering of groundwater hydrographs \nto surmise the structure and connectivity within the complex aquifer system of the Lower Namoi. The authors \ncreated a cluster dendrogram (Figure 32) that enabled them to map 3D spatial connectivity. From the plan \nprojections of the 17 bore clusters (Figure 33), the clusters most relevant to our AOI are 4-9 and 13. Blakers et al. \n(2011) notes that clusters 4-7 are hydrologically and spatially similar and extend almost the full thickness of the \naquifer, concluding that this indicates “excellent vertical connectivity”. Cluster 13, on the other hand, drops into the \ndeep paleochannel (Cubbaroo Formation) and corresponds to an area of high groundwater abstractions and where \nthe aquifer has become disconnected from the river; this large signal distance between this cluster and clusters 4-9 \n(Figure 32) indicate that it is not well connected to the surrounding aquifer. It is not clear based on current evidence \nwhether MAR could reconnect this aquifer, and therefore what implications there might be beyond the need to \nbetter understand this highly heterogeneous system.  \n \nGreat Artesian Basin \nThe Great Artesian Basin (GAB) is also present at depth (CSIRO, 2007), but its contribution to groundwater resources \nand applicability for MAR may be limited (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020) and is not considered further in this report. \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n36 \n \nFigure 31 Vertical connectivity of Namoi alluvium used in bioregional assessment Namoi groundwater model; <0.01 m/year suggests the \naquifer is well connected and >0.1 m/year that the aquifer is poorly connected (Aryal et al., 2018)   \nFuture analyses that could improve understanding of the system  \nAlthough there has been significant research in both the Namoi catchment and the Lower Namoi, there are still \nknowledge gaps about the aquifer system and how MAR could be implemented in the system. In November 2021, Dr. \nBryce Kelly, a researcher with a research history in the Lower Namoi, suggested a number of analyses that could be \nconducted to address some of these gaps 41.  An existing Mathematica model (Kelly et al., 2014)  could be used to \nassess storage potential in our selected area of interest.  A Menyanthes model (KWR Water 2000 42) could perform \ntime series analysis to identify the role of flooding vs other drivers of groundwater levels.  The stochastic model ling \napproach demonstrated in the L ower Namoi by Comunian et al. (2014) could be used to quantify uncertainty due to \n                                                            \n41  These analyses were not able to be conducted with the remaining time and resources available to the project team. \n42 https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/tools-producten/menyanthes/, accessed 30 November 2021 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n37 \nunder-constrained hydrogeological heterogeneity, and hence inform the location of further lithological logs or other \ninvestigations. \n \nFigure 32 Dendogram showing the top 17 levels of the hierarchical clusters (Blakers et al., 2011) \n \nFigure 33 Plan projections of the 17 bore clusters and the convex hulls enclosing them (Blakers et al., 2011). The approximate AOI is indicated \nby the red box. \n \n5.3.3 Groundwater levels  \nTrends in groundwater levels \nThe literature reports that historically gaining sections of the Namoi River have become losing sections as a result of \ngroundwater extraction in the region (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020); the river reach from Narrabri to Wee Waa (our \nAOI) is characterised as losing (Ivkovic, 2009). Large decreases in groundwater levels (up to 30 m) away from the \nriver have been reported (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020, Arshad et al., 2012). These drawdowns in the alluvial aquifers \nalso imply potential to store large volumes of water (Arshad et al., 2012).   \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n38 \nGroundwater levels at 580 monitoring bores at 250 sites in the Lower Namoi Groundwater are monitored by \nWaterNSW (Figure 34). WaterNSW is currently undertaking a review of water levels that will highlight ‘any areas of \nconcern and any further extraction management that may be required’ (DPIE, 2020a). For our area of interest, \nhydrographs for groundwater levels at two bores GW030450 and GW025325 are shown in Figure 35. \nThe first step in groundwater level analysis is allocating boreholes in the area to their respective aquifer – upper \n(Narrabri formation) and lower (Gunnedah formation), where they show different behaviours. Past studies have \nused a screening depth of 30 m to delineate the boreholes into formations (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). Data \nprovided from DPIE where boreholes were assigned into formations manually was used in this work for aquifer \ndelineation.  \nThe water level data in the lower aquifer was the focus as this is the aquifer that is used most for irrigation. Years \n2015 to 2019 are shown, where maximum drawdown is the lowest measured water level in the respective bores \nduring the calendar year and recovery is the highest measured water level in the respective bores during the \ncalendar year. The method used to interpolate between measure boreholes was inverse distance weighting (Kollias \net al., 1999, Kravchenko, 2003, Kravchenko and Bullock, 1999, Nalder and Wein, 1998, Schloeder et al., 2001), where \nunknown areas use surrounding points for prediction with closer points having more influence on the prediction. \nSome years have fewer data available resulting in a smaller area for interpolation and increased uncertainty. \nBoth maximum drawdown and recovery are more extreme in the northwest of the region, with this trend consistent \nover the years shown (Figure 36 to Figure 40 ).  \n \n \nFigure 34 WaterNSW Lower Namoi Groundwater Source monitoring sites (Source: DPIE, 2020a).

This period is examined to identify groundwater response to this \nevent. \nMonthly rainfall at a nearby gauge to the AOI – Narrabri (Mollee), gauge number: 53026 – was analysed to confirm \nthat the reported flooding was not solely due to large amounts of rainfall in the upper catchment. From the rainfall \ndata (Figure 41), large amounts of rainfall were recorded at the gauge around the time of the reported flooding. This \nis suggestive that rainfall would be available to recharge the aquifer in the AOI.  \n                                                            \n43 https://www.ses.nsw.gov.au/media/2552/the_summer_of_2000-2001.pdf \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n42 \nNext, the groundwater levels at monitoring bore in the AOI were plotted. First, the data was separated into two \nperiods: one capturing a longer period before and after the reported flood (1999-01-01 - 2001-12-31) and one \nfocused on the flood event (2000-06-01 - 2001-06-01). The data was separated by bore ID into upper and lower \naquifer, based on a characterisation from DPIE. The mean RSWL for each bore was calculated for the two respective \nperiods. The calculated mean RSWL was then subtracted from the measured bore levels to calculate the difference \nfrom the mean. This was done to be able to better visualise changes pre and post flood, and to make sure that the \nspread in RSWL between bores did not obscure any flood response. Results can be seen in Figure 42, Figure 43, \nFigure 44 and Figure 45.  \nIn the lower aquifer seasonal trends are more obvious (Figure 43 and Figure 45). The lower aquifer is the aquifer \nused more heavily for irrigation and so seasonal trends that correspond to periods of high and lower extraction are \nexpected. Trends in the upper aquifer are less obvious (Figure 42 and Figure 44). There are some bores in the upper \naquifer that had a positive response post flood, however, there were other bores that had little response or where \ngroundwater levels decreased (Figure 44). Further analysis would be needed to separate impact of pumping from \nrecharge, noting that given the hydrogeological heterogeneity in the lower Namoi, MAR would require location-\nspecific analysis of groundwater level response. \n \n \nFigure 41 Monthly rainfall, as measured at Narrabri (Mollee), before, during and after the reported flood event.

Water quality deteriorates west into the \nLower Namoi region, where brackish and saline groundwater is more common, although this does seem to be less \nproblematic northwest of Narrabri where this study is focused (see Figure 14). In the Namoi, areas of long-term \ndecline in groundwater levels, where drawdowns are high during pumping season and/or where intense pumping \noccurs during drought are more likely to see increases in groundwater salinity (Badenhop and Timms, 2012). \nVariation in groundwater salinity over a short distance is common (Badenhop and Timms, 2012).   \nUsing measurements of salinity at multiple bores, salinity was assessed (Figure 46). The aquifers were delineated \nbased on the screen depth of the individual bore. Once again inverse distance weighting (Kollias et al., 1999, \nKravchenko, 2003, Kravchenko and Bullock, 1999, Nalder and Wein, 1998, Schloeder et al., 2001) was used to \ninterpolate between measurements, where unknown areas use surrounding points for prediction with closer points \nhaving more influence on the prediction. Some bores have many measurements (i.e., as monitoring bores) while \nothers were only measured once, likely at time of drilling. All measurements for the years 2000 – 2019 were \ntherefore used and the average salinity was calculated at each bore before interpolation.  \nGenerally, salinity does not show any obvious trends in either aquifer in our AOI (Figure 46). It is possible that salinity \nmay increase to the northwest in the lower aquifer, consistent with wider spatial trends in the Lower Namoi (see \nFigure 14), however, this cannot be confirmed. Salinity values in the upper and lower aquifer also appear similar \n(Figure 46). \nBased on reported salinity tolerances of irrigated crops (NSW Department of Primary Industries, 2017), there should \nbe no yield reduction with water salinity up to 5.1 dS/m (5,100 uS/cm) for cotton. Based on the available data \nsalinities this high are basically absent in the region (Figure 46). \nThere is only one monitoring bore taking frequent measures of salinity in the region (GW273314.1.1) (Figure 47, \nFigure 48). This bore is likely in the deep aquifer based on its depth (depth = 195 m). The salinity at this bore has not \nchanged substantially over the last several years, ranging from 291 to 319 uS/cm. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n46 \n \nFigure 46 Salinity (uS/cm) in both upper and lower aquifer, where upper is delineated as having a screen depth less than 30 m.

This is due to the high permeability and infiltration rates of such soil types (Rahman et al., 2012, Russo et al., \n2015), which would allow for quick infiltration of recharge water. As a suggested water source for MAR in the Namoi \nare supplementary entitlements, which are often only available for a short period of time, fast infiltration of MAR \nwater would be important. \nInjection MAR schemes are less dependent on soil type, as they do not rely on infiltration. Instead the characteristics \nof the target aquifer are more critical (Yuan et al., 2016). Semi-confined or confined aquifers are often suitable for \ninjection wells (Yuan et al., 2016), while unconfined aquifers are better suited to infiltration basins. \nRisks of soil salinization have been of historic concern in Australia, including the Namoi. Soils that are free-draining \nand therefore better suited to MAR are also likely to have lower accumulation of any salts from river water. River \nwater would also be most likely to be recharged at times of higher flow and lower salinity. Infiltration would anyway \nbe avoided in locations where the water table is already saline, avoiding risks of saline water table rise. \n \nSoil characteristics of the Namoi \nThe reported presence of a clay layer on much of the alluvial deposits would hinder MAR water infiltration by \nreducing hydraulic connectivity (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). Higher recharge rates would be expected in the \npaleochannels that thread throughout the alluvial deposits (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020, Wray, 2009). Given soil and \naquifer heterogeneity, local investigation of suitability would be important. \nLikely infiltration rates in many locations in the Lower Namoi are approximately 0.2 m/day (Arshad et al., 2014, \nBouwer, 1999). Injection well recharge rates have been suggested to range from 0.5 – 8 ML/day per borehole, with \npast studies using the value of 2.2 ML/day (Arshad et al., 2014).   \n \nSoils characteristics of the Area of Interest \nIn the area of interest, preliminary suitability of soils for MAR was investigated using the Soil and Landscape Grid of \nAustralia (https://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid/), where national wide soil data is available for \nmultiple attributes, including clay and sand percentage, at varying depth intervals (0 - 5 cm, 5 - 15 cm, 15 – 30 cm, 30 \n– 60 cm, 60 – 100 cm and 100 – 200 cm).  \nThe sand % soil data shows a decrease in sand % with depth (Figure 49). There does appear to be a sandy corridor \nthat runs north-west of the Namoi River, which is consistent at all depths (Figure 49).  \nFiner resolution confirmation is important. The sand % data from the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia shows \napparent areas of high sand % under farm dams, which is not mirrored in the areas directly adjacent to the dams \n(Figure 49, Figure 50). Although possible, this is unlikely since unlined dams would accumulate silt and clay over \ntime, and farm operators would not look to build dams in sandy areas as this would lead to unnecessary losses. Local \nexperience notes that dams in the region show very little leakage. \n \nSalinisation  \nThe accumulation of water-soluble salts in the soil is termed salinisation44. The accumulation of salts in the soil can \nhave a detrimental effect on plant growth. High soil salinity can also have a negative impact on the water quality of \nunderlying aquifers if the salts are mobilised during, for example, large recharge events, floods or periods of intense \nirrigation (Badenhop and Timms, 2012). Causes of salination include the presence of soluble salts, a perched water \ntable, high evaporation rates, the use of saline water for irrigation and/or low annual rainfall (e.g., semi-arid \nclimate). \n                                                            \n44 https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_053151.pdf, accessed 8th November 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n49 \nSalinisation has been highlighted as a possible threat to irrigation agriculture in the upper NSW catchments of the \nMDB (Triantafilis et al., 2004, Triantafilis et al., 2003). In upper parts of the Namoi catchment the presence of dryland \nsalinity is established (Triantafilis et al., 2004). However, modelling efforts showed that salinisation risk in our AOI is \nlow based on the water currently being used for irrigation in the area (Triantafilis et al., 2004). If irrigation in the area \nwas to occur using saline water, the potential for salinisation increases and management protocols would likely have \nto be implemented to ensure cropping systems could continue as they do now (Triantafilis et al., 2004). The crops \ncommonly used in rotation with cotton (e.g., wheat and legumes), are more susceptible to salinisation than cotton \nitself (Triantafilis et al., 2004). Cotton-based rotations that reduce subsoil structure, limiting drainage, have been \nshown to increase salinisation of the root zone in the Lower Namoi, even when irrigation water quality is reasonable \n(Weaver et al., 2013). Areas where prior stream channels are present have an overall lower risk of salt accumulation \nin the soil, however, if saline irrigation water from more brackish water sources were to be used for irrigation, \ncontamination of local groundwater via deep drainage is possible (Triantafilis et al., 2004), as is a rising groundwater \ntables (Triantafilis et al., 2003). \nThe above studies, although not directly related to MAR, do provide some valuable insights into how MAR could \noperate and not increase salinisation risk in the area. The use of ‘good’ quality water for MAR, particularly MAR that \ninvolves infiltration whether through basins or in a AgMAR scheme, is imperative to limit soil salinisation. Also, \nmonitoring groundwater levels and quality in the upper aquifer would assist in decreasing the likelihood of a \nperched saline water table. Schemes that involve AgMAR would also have to consider soil structure, both to ensure \nhigh infiltration rates are preserved and to limit salinisation. \n \n5.3.6 Recharge \nPrevious studies have focused on understanding recharge that occurs via the river (Kelly et al., 2009) or have \nacknowledged that recharge from the river could be significant (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). Other studies have \nexplored the magnitude of irrigation recharge (Ringrose-Voase and Nadelko, 2011). Recharge from rainfall is \nconsidered to be very small or negligible (Welsh et al., 2014). \nRiver recharge \nThe streams on the alluvial plain flow across the top of the Narrabri Formation and an unsaturated zone can develop \nat points where the rivers are in direct hydraulic contact with the watertable; in this situation, surface water \nrecharges the underlying aquifer as long as streamflow persists (Welsh et al., 2014). \nElectrical imaging along the lower Namoi River suggests that river water, river recharge hosted in clay, and river \nrecharge hosted in sands and gravels could be differentiated based on electrical conductivity (Kelly et al., 2009). That \nis to say that water quality (i.e., salinity) is not the major influence on electromagnetic (EM) data in this region (Kelly \net al., 2009). This allowed for continuous sections of sand and gravels present beneath the river to be identified \nthrough low observed EC, suggestive of areas that are a hydraulic link between the river and underlying aquifers \n(Kelly et al., 2009). Piezometer data was explored to see if the impacts of floods were observable at depth (i.e., in the \ndeeper Gunnedah formation) (Figure 51). From this there was evidence that flood waters migrate to the deeper \nsemi-confined aquifer via recharge pathways beneath the Namoi River (Kelly et al., 2009). This was further expanded \nby looking at interpolated groundwater head data from pre- and post-flood to assess the broader impact of flood \nwater moving down the river (Figure 52) (Kelly et al., 2009). Groundwater mounding near the river occurred in \nsimilar locations for flooding events in the past 50 years - to the north (Figure 52) (Kelly et al., 2009). This supports \nthe notion that gravel and sand paleochannels extend to the north (Kelly et al., 2009).  \nA strategy suggested for where MAR in the region could be achieved is by building a weir between the old Wee Waa \nbridge and Wee Waa (Dr. Bryce Kelly, pers. comm. November 2020). Looking at past research (Iverach et al., 2017), \nMollee’s Weir works like a MAR system currently but this likely benefits those close to the river and not in the north \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n50 \nwestern area of the Lower Namoi on the palaeochannel (Dr. Bryce Kelly, pers. comm.

All wells were assumed to be in the upper aquifer based on depth. Findings showed that wells closer \nthe Namoi River and in the surrounding paleochannels displayed rapid peaks in groundwater level in response to \nrecharge events, while these changes tend to smoothen in wells further from the river (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). \nSimilar trends could be seen in the estimates of recharge at the well sites (Figure 53), where high recharge estimates \noccurred in the paleochannels surrounding the Namoi River (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). The high spatial variability \nof recharge estimates is also highlighted (Figure 53).   \n \n \nFigure 53 Mean recharge estimates for different labelled monitoring wells along the lower Namoi River. All wells are assumed to be located in \nthe upper aquifer. Source: Fuentes and Vervoort (2020) \nDue to groundwater extractions from the Gunnedah Formation, the Northern Namoi paleochannel (Figure 54) acts \nas a drain and there is significant downward leakage from the Narrabri formation (Herr et al., 2018). \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n54 \n \nFigure 54 Northern Namoi paleochannel and water table (mAHD) in the Narrabri formation (SWS, 2011 in Herr et al., 2018) \n \nIrrigation \nEstimates of groundwater recharge of irrigation vary greatly and it is uncertain whether this water ‘migrates \nlaterally, returns to the surface water flows or moves downwards to recharge deeper aquifers’ (Welsh et al., 2014). \nRingrose-Voase and Nadelko (2011) identified that this recharge under cotton grown on soils in the Namoi can be \nsignificant and can occur in two forms. Matrix drainage occurs when water inputs exceed ET losses and the soil \nprofile is filled to capacity. By-pass drainage occurs as quick downward flow through macropores thus bypassing the \nsoil profile which can be in water deficit (Ringrose-Voase and Nadelko, 2011). This form of recharge can be dominant \nform of recharge during the irrigation season with implications for reducing drainage losses and for the efficient \nleaching of salt from the soil profile (Ringrose-Voase and Nadelko, 2011). \n \n5.3.7 Implications for the design, planning and implementation of MAR strategies \nManaging recharge \nThere are many different strategies used to implement MAR. Infiltration basins are a popular choice when the target \naquifer is both shallow and non-saline and the soils in the area are sandy with high infiltration rates (Beganskas and \nFisher, 2017, Rahman et al., 2012, Russo et al., 2015, Vanderzalm et al., 2018, Dillon, 2005). Infiltration could also \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n55 \noccur via natural features such as paleochannels and losing stream reaches (Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020). The \nefficiency of infiltration ponds may decrease over time due to clogging by sediments present in the water to be \nrecharged (Hutchison et al., 2013), which decreases soil conductivity. There are methods to limit clogging including \nthe use of wetting and drying cycles (Hutchison et al., 2013, Vanderzalm et al., 2015) and the use of settling ponds to \nreduce suspended soils in recharge water (Arshad et al., 2014, Beganskas and Fisher, 2017). MAR via channel \nseepage works the same way as infiltration basins except that already established channels are used rather than \nspecifically constructing basins. Injection wells are often used when the target aquifer is deep (i.e., not directly below \nthe surface) and semi-confined or confined (Yuan et al., 2016, Dillon, 2005). Once again clogging can be a potential \nissue, but the use of settling ponds (Arshad et al., 2014) and back washing of the well can limit this (Barnett et al., \n2000). Further details on infiltration and injection based MAR schemes can be found in Guillaume et al. (2020), the \nMurrumbidgee case study report prepared for this project.  \nA MAR method applicable in the Namoi not discussed in Guillaume et al. (2020) is agricultural managed aquifer \nrecharge (Ag-MAR). Ag-MAR can employ many MAR techniques including canal seepage, off-season field irrigation \nand field flooding/spreading for infiltration, and is based on the idea that significant aquifer recharge occurs from \nagricultural land naturally (Niswonger et al., 2017, Ghasemizade et al., 2019, Ganot and Dahlke, 2021, Waterhouse et \nal., 2021, Kourakos et al., 2019, Murphy et al., 2021). Ag-MAR is an example of conjunctive use of surface and \ngroundwater (Niswonger et al., 2017). Periods of excess surface water (i.e., flood) have been highlighted as \nparticularly suitable for Ag-MAR (Niswonger et al., 2017, Murphy et al., 2021). Ag-MAR has most potential in \nagricultural basins and can increase sustainable yield in the target aquifer (Niswonger et al., 2017, Ghasemizade et \nal., 2019). Improved ecosystem services can also be a consequence of Ag-MAR (Niswonger et al., 2017). Benefits of \nAg-MAR over other MAR methods includes the reduced need for specific infrastructure to support MAR, the \nlikelihood of infrastructure to deliver water already being established and the likely placement of agricultural areas \nnear rivers and other water sources (Niswonger et al., 2017, Kourakos et al., 2019). Ag-MAR can also be scheduled to \noccur only when crops are not being grown (off-season), meaning that Ag-MAR may not complete with other land \nuses (Niswonger et al., 2017, Ghasemizade et al., 2019, Ganot and Dahlke, 2021). Ag-MAR has its challenges \nincluding the need for farmers to gain knowledge on Ag-MAR, possible water-logging and possible aquifer \ncontamination (Niswonger et al., 2017, Ghasemizade et al., 2019, Ganot and Dahlke, 2021, Waterhouse et al., 2021, \nMurphy et al., 2021). Like other MAR schemes, recovery of water recharged through Ag-MAR would require changes \nto water policy (Niswonger et al., 2017). Ag-MAR as a concept is relatively new, with pilots having occurred in \nCalifornia and recent modelling studies (Ghasemizade et al., 2019, Niswonger et al., 2017, Ganot and Dahlke, 2021, \nHarter, 2015, Waterhouse et al., 2021, Kourakos et al., 2019).   \n \nRecovery efficiency \nRecovery rates in the AOI, and the Lower Namoi more generally, should not be a barrier to the extraction of MAR \nwater due to the prominent use of groundwater currently. Bore yields in the Gunnedah and Cubbaroo Formations, \nwhich are currently tapped into for irrigation purposes, produce yields up to 250 L/sec (Arshad et al., 2014). Given \nthat local watercourses are losing (i.e. recharge groundwater) rather than gaining (i.e. receiving groundwater), the \nprimary loss of recharged water in the AOI would be through increased lateral flow to the west, though the extent of \nthis loss would require site-specific analyses of flow paths to gain confidence in assignment of any right to recover \nrecharged water. Given the productivity of groundwater in the AOI, MAR would be expected to support groundwater \nlevels in the long term. The volume of water to be recovered across all groundwater users would likely be the \nprimary constraint on recovery of recharged water, and would vary over time depending on the state of the \ngroundwater system prior to its drawdown in dry years; active management of groundwater storage would help \nmaximise its benefits.  \n \nMonitoring design to manage effects \nThe NSW Office of Water already monitoring groundwater levels at over 600 sites in the catchment, with monitoring \nbeginning as early as the 1970s (Green et al., 2011).

Bores in the AOI and surrounds are shown in \nFigure 55. Given the heterogeneity of the aquifer, local investigation of soils and aquifers will likely be necessary \nboth in planning of MAR and monitoring of aquifer responses. \nMonitoring information has been used in groundwater model development for the Lower Namoi, which are used to \nestimate groundwater recharge and predict groundwater level responses (Green et al., 2011).  \n \n5.4 Financial viability \n5.4.1 Cost-benefit analysis of MAR and surface storage options under uncertainty \nIn a series of papers (Arshad et al., 2013, Arshad et al., 2014), Arshad and colleagues investigated the irrigation \nrelated costs and benefits over a 50-year timeframe for a hypothetical irrigation enterprise in the Lower Namoi for \nthree different water storage and management options: on-farm surface storage (the base case), infiltration-based \nMAR, and injection-based Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR). Arshad et al. (2014) recognised that while some \nstudies, including Arshad et al. (2013), had found that MAR options could be financially competitive or superior to \nsurface storage options, these studies had not explored the impact of the inherent uncertainty on the cost-benefits \nanalyses. \nThe studies assumed that water availability was constrained such that <20% of the available land was irrigated. The \ncropping pattern under all was irrigated cotton Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) and faba bean (Vicia faba L) as the summer \nand winter rotations on irrigated land with winter wheat, chick pea and faba bean carried out on marginal lands and \non paddocks that are not cultivated by irrigation water. It was assumed that all required irrigation infrastructure, \nsuch as surface storage and irrigation water delivery network, existed and covered the entire irrigation land area. \nAnnual water availability was set at 1350 ML based on recent (at the time) irrigation water allocations in the Lower \nNamoi. Farm economic data was adopted from available literature (Table 6). \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n57 \n \nFigure 55 Bores in the region.

Arshad et al.

(2013); 2 Source: Arshad et al. (2014) \n \nArshad et al. (2014) explored the uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness of MAR. They did this by systematically \nsearching for conditions where the requirements for MAR may not be met and which could lead to potential failure. \nCross-over points (thresholds) were defined that correspond to the values of variables at which the net present \nvalue (NPV) from MAR and surface storage become equal. At the cross-over point, a decision maker might be \nindifferent to selecting an option from the two, at least based on financial returns. Arshad et al. (2014) argue that \nthe benefits of this cross-over approach are that it can: \n1. determine minimum hydrogeological and cost requirements under which MAR can be worthwhile, \n2. improve confidence in decision making for MAR investment, by enabling the assessment of conditions \nthat are unfavourable to MAR compared to surface water storage, and \n3. substantially lower the cost of geophysical and hydrogeological investigations by targeting only areas \nthat satisfy the minimum requirements, as MAR investigations and trials are shown to be time and \nresource expensive. \nThe methodological underpinning of this analysis (using a different case study) is described in further detail in \n(Guillaume et al., 2016). \nThe break-even analysis of cross-over points involved finding values of variables that will provide exactly the same \nfinancial returns from the two compared options. The single variable cross-over points represent the minimum \nrequirements for MAR to be preferred to surface water storage, assuming that the values of other variables remain \nfixed. Two variables can interact in a way that they can increase, decrease or balance the effect of each other on the \nresulting advantage of MAR over surface storage. These are shown in  \nTable 8 where an NA indicates no cross-over point exists between the two options.  \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n59 \nTable 8 Single variable cross-over points in three scenarios, for which the preferred option may change from basin infiltration to surface storage \nor injection-based aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), or from surface storage to ASR. \nNo. Variable (Unit) Best Guess \n(Modelled) \nValue \nCross-Over Point \nSurface Storage and \nBasin Infiltration \nSurface Storage \nand ASR \nBasin Infiltration \nand ASR \n1 Pumping cost ($/ML) 35 53.63 NA NA \n2 Surface evaporation rate (%) 40 34 74 NA \n3 Basin capital cost ($/ML) 363 466.69 NA 1,085.55 \n4 Basin infiltration rate (m/day) 0.2 0.16 NA 0.07 \n5 Basin maintenance rate (% of capital \ncost) \n10 15 NA NA \n6 MAR loss rate (% of target storage \nvolume) \n5 11 NA NA \n7 ASR water treatment cost ($/ML) 150 NA 13.25 NA \n8 ASR maintenance rate (% of capital cost) 0.07 NA NA NA \n9 Price of cotton ($/bale) 538 475.64 1,155.22 NA \n10 Price of faba bean ($/tonne) 348 229.52 NA NA \n11 Discount rate (%) 7 13 NA NA \n12 Lifespan of surface storage (Year) 30 48.16 5.57 NA \n13 Lifespan of basin infiltration (Year) 30 23.51 NA 6.69 \n14 Lifespan ASR (Year) 20 NA NA NA \n \nLooking at the difference between the best guess and the cross-over point values highlights the variables of most \nconcern regarding the financial viability of MAR. This is shown in Table 9 using basin-scale infiltration and surface \nstorage where several variables are close to the point of greatest concern. It is unlikely that all variables would \nchange from best guess and result in the worst case and so Arshad et al. (2014) analysed groups of variables to \nassess whether or not the generated scenario is possible, and if so what mitigation options might be implemented \nand what adaptation actions might need to be taken. The analyses indicated that MAR using basin infiltration can be \nfinancially superior to surface storage in the Lower Namoi for a suitable site that has a high infiltration rate, low loss \nrates and achieved other minimum requirements. \n \n5.4.2 Implications of the scenarios to the business case for MAR \nThe MAR for low loss water storage scenario (see Section 4.2) relies on a farm-specific assessment of \nevapotranspiration and other losses compared to MAR, and while the crossover analysis presented in Section 5.4.1 \nsuggests that may be worthwhile, the effect of operations and high soil and geological heterogeneity means that the \nbusiness case will be location specific. Preliminary discussions suggest that farmers will require individual support to \nmake this assessment (see Section 5.6.3). \nThe Moving water north scenario (see Section 4.3) relies on collaboration between farmers. The business case rests \non how costs and benefits of a scheme would be distributed spatially. Most benefits of alleviating drawdown would \nlikely be indirect in the form of reduced pressure on groundwater levels further from the recharge point, which \nmeans that there is likely to be substantial uncertainty and a high level of trust is required. \nThe River recharge as MAR third scenario (see Section 4.4) alters river operations which involves substantial policy \nchange and likely requires a higher degree of impact assessment. This means it is not currently appropriate to \ncomment on the business case for this scenario. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n60 \nTable 9 Cross-over point of greatest concern with basin infiltration vs. surface storage, using a subset of variables (Arshad et al., 2014).

While there are no extensive wetland complexes, \nthese floodplain networks support a wide variety of waterbirds, fish, vegetation and other biota. The Sustainable \nRivers Audit 2 (released in 2012) reported the overall ecosystem health of the Namoi River valley as poor and the \nfish community as very poor. Despite the large presence of alien fish species and elevated sediment loads in rivers, \nthere are a number of threatened aquatic fauna known to occur in the in the Namoi, particularly between Gunnedah \nand Narrabri. The Namoi catchment wetlands and rivers also support important Aboriginal cultural heritage values \nfor the Kamilaroi (Gomeroi) people. \nWhile there are no extensive wetland complexes, areas downstream of the Narrabri contain many small lagoons, \nwetlands, anabranches and floodplain wetlands. The Namoi Long-Term Water Plan (DPIE, 2020b, DPIE, 2020c), \ndeveloped as required under the Murray–Darling Basin Plan, is intended for water managers to use “to guide and \ninform their actions to support the ongoing health of rivers and wetlands for the benefit of plants, animals and \npeople” 47. 36 planning units have been defined under the Plan, the relevant one for the AOI being PU2 (Boggabri to \nWee Waa; Figure 56). The Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) holds general security entitlements \nfor the Upper Namoi and Lower Namoi (Table 10) for environmental watering of the assets focusing on in-channel \nand off-channel assets. The priority environmental assets and values in this area are shown in Table 10. The main \nCEWO environmental objectives are to support both longitudinal connectivity, including with the Lower Namoi \nfloodplain and the Barwon River, and lateral connectivity between the river and floodplain. These demands are \nsubject to water availability, antecedent conditions, and environmental demands. The native fish objectives for PU2 \nand environmental watering requirements for the Namoi River at Mollee (gauge 419039), which is at the eastern \nedge of this study’s AOI, are shown in Table 12 and respectively. \n \n5.5.2 Flows into the Barwon River system \nThere is a growing awareness of the importance of connecting flows across the northern Basin, to support habitat, \nwater quality, native fish and other aquatic species in the Barwon-Darling and its tributary systems, including the \nNamoi River. Depending on flow conditions in the Barwon and Namoi rivers and weir drownouts, native fish can \nmove between these catchments, supporting native fish populations. Connection can provide opportunities for fish \ndispersal, increasing genetic diversity and recruitment. \nThe Namoi River connects with the Barwon-Darling near Walgett and is considered to have a high level of \nconnectivity to the Barwon–Darling whereas the Macquarie-Castlereagh is considered to have a low to medium level \nof connectivity depending on local catchment conditions.  A small flow of 100–150 ML/day at Wee Waa is needed to \nprovide connection between the Namoi and Barwon rivers. This action is dependent on the Barwon River flowing \nhigh enough to back up from Walgett weir (11A) and drown out the Walgett town weir on the Namoi River, so will \nideally occur when Barwon River flows are over 4000 ML/day at Dangar Bridge. \n                                                            \n47 https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/water/water-for-the-environment/planning-and-reporting/long-term-water-\nplans/namoi, accessed 22 September 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n62 \nWhen using flood water for MAR it would be important to show that flood regimes in the region would not be \nfurther altered.

About 36 GL of \nentitlements exist in the AOI (see Table 3). Past literature has suggested that the use of supplementary water could \nbe used for MAR without compromising environmental flow and ecological requirements and the ecological role of \nfloods in the river systems (Arshad et al., 2012). The specific rules around the take of supplementary flows are \nintended to manage such impacts (see Section 5.7.2). \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n64 \n5.5.4 Water Sharing Plan for the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources Order 2020 \nThe WSP has the broad environmental objective “to protect the condition of the groundwater sources and their \ngroundwater-dependent ecosystems over the term of this Plan” 48. The specific objectives listed under Part 2 (9) of \nthe plan are (a) to protect the extent and condition of high priority groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDE), (b) to \ncontribute to the maintenance of salinity levels (total dissolved solids) within water quality target ranges that \nsupport high priority groundwater-dependent ecosystems and (c) to contribute to the prevention of groundwater \nextraction induced structural damage to the aquifers in the system 49. The performance indicators used to measure \nthe success of the strategies for the environmental objectives pertaining to GDE are the extent and recorded \ncondition of high priority groundwater-dependent ecosystems, the recorded condition of target populations of high \npriority groundwater-dependent native vegetation, the recorded values of salinity levels (total dissolved solids) and \nrecorded values of groundwater levels 50. Water quality and GDE considerations are briefly discussed below. \n \nWater quality risks \nAs highlighted in Section 5.6.2 (page 67), there were some concerns from irrigators regarding the potential risk that \nMAR could pose to groundwater (Rawluk et al., 2013). That said, all groundwater sources are subject to the NSW \nAquifer Interference Policy (NSW AIP; see page 71 for more detail). Potential MAR schemes in the Namoi catchment \nthat involved injection would certainly require an aquifer access license and a groundwater use license (see Section \n5.7.4), and demonstrate that minimal impact considerations can be met 51,52. The injection of ‘river’ water into deep \naquifers or low salinity shallow aquifers might not pose a serious risk to groundwater quality, although it is \nimportant to note that the potential for geochemical reactions has not been examined in this report. \nThe Lower Namoi Groundwater Source is one of the priority locations for maintaining salinity levels under the WSP \nfor the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources. Water quality target ranges for the groundwater sources will be \ndefined by the Water Quality Management Plan: GW14 of the Namoi Alluvium Water Resource Plan. The latest NSW \nNamoi Alluvium WRP was submitted to the MDBA on April 2020, and withdrawn March 2021 pending resubmission \n53 \n \nGroundwater dependent ecosystems  \nThe GDE identified in the WSP for the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources 2020 are groundwater dependent \nvegetation associated with the river channels. Setback rules have been applied in the Lower Namoi for new water \nsupply works. Works must take place 100 metres from a river if the work will take water for basic landholder rights \nonly and 200 metres from a river for all other groundwater works, and 200 m from any high priority groundwater-\ndependent ecosystem defined in Figure 57 \n54. \n  \n                                                            \n48 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2020-0346, accessed 28 September 2021 \n49 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2020-0346, accessed 28 September 2021 \n50 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2020-0346, accessed 28 September 2021 \n51 The situation regarding infiltration-based systems is less clear although it could be argued that in the context of a shallow aquifer where \ninfiltration might increase the risk of waterlogging, and salinization, this would constitute interference and there is a need to address the risk \nof deleterious environmental and other impacts. \n52 Note that the Aquifer Interference Approvals mechanism has not yet been activated (see Section 5.7.1, page 51) \n53 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/water-resource-plans/drafts, accessed 28 September 2021 \n54 https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/whole/html/inforce/current/sl-2020-0346, accessed 28 September 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n65 \nTable 13 Environmental watering requirements for gauge 419039, the Namoi River at Mollee (Source: DPIE, 2020c) \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n66 \n  \nFigure 57 High priority GDE map from the WSP for the Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources ( https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2020-0346/maps, accessed 16 September 2021) \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n67 \n5.6 Social acceptability \n5.6.1 Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater \nConjunctive water use is happening in the Namoi Valley; of the 13 farms in the AOI, one farm has only surface water \nentitlements and two have only aquifer licences. The other ten farms do have both surface water and groundwater \nentitlements, with the latter ranging between 0.3% and 30% of the volume of 1 ML shares of surface water \nentitlements (Figure 58).  \n \nFigure 58 Total number of 1 ML shares, disaggregated by water allocation type, for each of the 13 farms in the AOI (Data source: \nhttps://waterregister.waternsw.com.au/water-register-frame, 16 September 2021) \n \n5.6.2 Past social research into MAR and groundwater management \nLocal interest in Managed Aquifer Recharge  \nSharp and Curtis (2012) and Rawluk et al. (2013) investigated the acceptability of using flood water for MAR (termed \nAquifer Storage and Recovery [ASR] in their study) to groundwater irrigators in the Namoi (Table 14). Most of the \n210 useable responses to the Namoi survey agreed that ASR has merit although some research informants were \nconcerned about the impact of recharge on groundwater quality and the possibility that ASR would be another \nintervention that would lead to over-exploitation of a scarce resource. The irrigator survey indicated that \nrespondents would be open to investing further in WUE measures if public funds were used to develop ASR \ninfrastructure (Table 15). \nTable 14 Proportion of respondents supporting MAR in the Namoi in 2011 (Source: Rawluk et al., 2013) \n  \n \nSome quotes from the study (Rawluk et al., 2013): \n[It is] about time someone promoted artificial recharge, farmers in our area have been trying to convince \nthe government departments to develop the process for years. \n0\n10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n60000\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\nTotal number of 1 ML shares\nAquifer Domestic And Stock Domestic And Stock[Stock] Regulated River (General Security)\nRegulated River (High Security) Regulated River (High Security)[Research] Supplementary Water\n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n68 \nWe require much more explanation before this can be considered. It is rare that these processes occur \nwithout loss of entitlement and asset and an increase in taxes on the water user. \nAquifers are ancient pristine water sources and should NOT be contaminated with flood flows or coal \nseam gas. \nThere was a trend (although not statistically significant) for MAR supporters to be operating larger properties, have \nlarger areas laid out for irrigation, own larger groundwater entitlements, and spend more time in on-property work. \nSupporters of MAR were significantly more likely to have entered the water market to purchase permanent or \ntemporary water in the past five years and intend to purchase temporary water in the future. MAR supporters were \nsignificantly more likely to agree that collective management of groundwater at the local scale would ensure \noperating rules are appropriate to local conditions and environmental circumstances. Survey respondents who \nopposed or were unsure about MAR tended to place greater importance on environmental conservation. \n \nTable 15 Views about ASR in the Namoi catchment expressed in the 2011 Namoi groundwater management survey \n \nA cautionary note is that this survey is several years old; since this period groundwater extraction limits have \nreduced and irrigators, communities and the environment, have suffered through a serious drought. The question \nthen is how opinions might have changed over time. \n \nCollective management of groundwater \nSharp and Curtis (2012) asked groundwater licence holders in the Namoi Valley for their views on collective \nmanagement of groundwater, that is the ‘management of groundwater resources by water users’ as an alternative \nform of groundwater governance (Table 16). There was general support from the 210 survey respondents with 69% \nagreeing that collective management of groundwater at the local scale would ensure operating rules are appropriate \nto local conditions and environmental circumstances. The role of the Government to ‘umpire’ collective \nmanagement was broadly acknowledged, with 61% of respondents signalling the Government should oversee \noperating rules that were developed with landholder input. The results of Sharp and Curtis (2012) highlighted that \nrespondents who had ‘pro-conservation values and beliefs, and altruistic values and beliefs’ were more favourable \ntowards collective management than older licence-holders or those who had managed their enterprise for longer. \nTheir study also highlighted the importance for the implementation of collective management to have “the strong \nsupport of practitioners on-the-ground whom licence-holders find more trustworthy than the agency itself”. \nTable 16 Views about collective management of groundwater from the 2011 Namoi groundwater management survey of Sharp and Curtis \n(2012).

Not Applicable was a separate response option. \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n69 \n \n \n5.6.3 Preliminary feedback on MAR scenarios  \nProject team resources available for this (the third and final) case study, COVID-19 travel restrictions, and the \nNovember-December floods constrained the extent of local engagement with irrigators and local stakeholders in the \nLower Namoi region. This section summarises preliminary feedback on the MAR scenarios presented in Section 4 \nfrom a Lower Namoi irrigator [I1], an academic with expertise in the hydrogeology of the Namoi catchment [H1] and \nNSW DPIE water policy [WP1] staff. \n \nMAR context and purpose \nThere is interest in MAR to support the agricultural industry despite the considerable uncertainties associated with \ndemonstrating the ‘business case’ for individual farmers or enterprises to change current operational water \nmanagement approaches and invest in developing MAR schemes [I1]. The potential for MAR to support towns was \nnoted as potentially more critical than for agricultural purpose given the number of small and ‘fairly ineffective’ \nweirs and where calls for innovative local solutions are needed to address the deficiencies of the many small weirs \nalong the Darling system and its tributaries that are intended to service the water demands of towns [I1]. For \nagriculture, a critical challenge would be making decisions around the efficiency of recharging surface water, that is, \nare land managers better off making the most of their water while they can or trying to elongate access during dry \ntimes [I1]? This is likely a farm-specific calculation. MAR would need to be considered in the light of all other aspects \nof water management in the Lower Namoi region, including floodplain harvesting and will need a water accounting \nsystem to be developed for MAR to happen [I1, WP1].  \n \nSource of water \n[I1] noted that the typical sequence of water used by irrigators \n55 in the region are on-farm water sources then \ngeneral security if available and, when other sources are not available, groundwater 56. They noted that if an irrigator \nhas general security water available they tend to make best use of it as soon as possible; they did not know of \nanyone they thought would use general security licences for MAR as the analysis needed to demonstrate the benefit \nof ‘propping up the least-used and most reliable’ water source [groundwater] would be prohibitive. \n57 The take of \nsupplementary water is so sporadic that when an event is announced [I1] noted that licence holders order as much \n                                                            \n55 Irrigators, as referred to by [I1] is assumed in the context of the Lower Namoi to cover producers of irrigated cotton or other \nirrigated annual crops. \n56 For this irrigator’s enterprise, if conditions are such that their only source of water is groundwater, then the operations of the \nenterprise are scaled back to ‘subsistence’ farming with the aim of keeping infrastructure operations and core workers \nemployed. They are very conscious of how much pumping occurs in the dry season and do not want to ‘bugger up’ the aquifer. \n57 Since reductions in entitlements happened, restrictions on groundwater extractions have not needed to be enforced. \nAlthough groundwater use got close to the compliance trigger for the long-term average annual extraction limit (LTAAEL) in the \nLower Namoi, this limit has not been breached (see Figure 22). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n70 \nwater as they can get and store it in on-farm dams. They felt that as the water is used in the following weeks and \nmonths, the losses due to evaporation were not a sufficient reason to use supplementary flows as the water source \nfor MAR. A similar argument was made for water sourced from floodplain harvesting. \nThe most promising source of water for MAR was seen by [I1] and [H1] as interventions to enhance recharge during \nlarge flood events where the water spreads extensively across the landscape and can inundate the land surface for \nextended periods of time. The challenge for MAR, noted by [I1], is that most of the country in the AOI consists of \nheavy black soils and on-farm storages do not leak. Interventions to enhance recharge might need to identify areas \nof land with high infiltration and/or excavate the top layer (~10-15 m) to reach more permeable soils. \n \nFeedback on MAR scenarios \nMAR for low loss storage: Whilst MAR is often proposed as a means for reducing evaporative losses (See Section \n5.2.4), [I1] did not think that this scenario would be desirable to most farmers in the AOI; rather individual farms will \ncontinue to order surface water and put it into on-farm water storages for use as soon as possible. This person felt \nthat quite a specific analysis would be needed to demonstrate the benefit of ordered water being recharged and \nrecovered later and that this analysis would be beyond the capacity of most farmers without assistance. \nMoving water north: Of the three scenarios, [I1] felt that this was the most needed option but that there are \nsubstantial complexities that would need to be overcome. There are reportedly restrictions to lateral groundwater \nflow that limits the effect of river recharge [I1, H1]. Moving water through the existing channel infrastructure would \nbe possible but this might mean that water is moved onto and through someone’s dryland enterprise at a time when \nthey do not want it. Regional drawdown (see Figure 36 to Figure 40) is of concern to [I1] but they noted that this is \nnow in an area that is not intensively farmed with a shift from irrigated farming to dryland agriculture or livestock. \n[H1] felt that recharging the northern region was the most challenging scenario to achieve and wondered about the \ncost required to implement the scheme in relation to the number of people who would benefit from the scheme.  \nRiver recharge as MAR: The hydrogeological context for this scenario reflects the current reality that river recharge \nis naturally recharging the alluvial aquifers of the Lower Namoi. Mollee’s Weir was identified by [H1] as a nice ‘MAR’ \nsystem on the Namoi and that the ‘best way to do MAR in the region would be to build a weir mid-way between the \nold Wee Waa bridge and Wee Waa’. [I1] thought that Mollee’s Weir was a huge part of the natural recharge that \nsupported extractions in the area they operate. The implication for the River Recharge as MAR scenario (Section 4.4) \nis the challenge around the potential to control or further enhance river recharge to achieve desired outcomes. \n \nKnowledge building and strategic planning \nPart of the uncertainty around the potential of MAR in the AOI stems from remaining knowledge gaps on the \nimplications of the highly heterogenous hydrogeology and its implications for groundwater response to MAR. \nAt both the irrigator enterprise and institutional levels, in-house capacity for strategic water planning and investing \nin recharge and groundwater monitoring has been identified as a constraint to MAR. For irrigator enterprises, the \never-increasing financial and time resources needed to comply with water regulatory requirements has been \ncompounded by large increases in the price of water. For [I1] this meant that non-essential activities that had been \nconducted in the past, including groundwater monitoring, have been scaled back. In terms of institutional support \nfor strategic water planning, the CRDC was noted as the closest to an organisation that could support cotton \nproducers in the region, together with the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI) with whom [I1] interacted \nprimarily in relation to agronomic work. Water specific matters such as studies needed to comply with NSW water \nmanagement and accounting requirements (e.g. around floodplain harvesting) need to be outsourced to \nconsultants, raising the prospect of equity issues for small operators interested in MAR. A water institution \nequivalent to the well-trusted ACRI, that drew on support from the advocacy role played by Namoi Water, was seen \nas desirable by [I1] to support the operational water management of irrigators into the future . \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n71 \n5.7 Governance arrangements \nThis section summarises the NSW Aquifer Interference Policy (AIP) and the Australian Guidelines for Water \nRecycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge (NRMMC et al., 2009) in Section 5.7.1; more detail on these is given in \n(Guillaume et al., 2020). This is followed by a summary of relevant rules within the WSP covering our AOI (Section \n5.7.2), the NSW Floodplain Harvesting Policy (Section 5.7.3) and the recently released NSW Water Strategy (Section \n5.7.4). \n \n5.7.1 Summary of relevant material from Milestone 4.1 report (Murrumbidgee Case Study) \nMuch of the policy context and governance arrangements considered in the Murrumbidgee case study (Guillaume et \nal., 2020) is relevant to the Namoi case study. The key points from that case study were that  \n1. The absence of MAR policies in NSW was an opportunity to ensure rules play to the strengths of MAR while \nminimising associated risks.  \n2. Pilots for recharge and monitoring can already go ahead with current regulatory frameworks, and are \nneeded to build confidence and expertise. \nThis section summarises relevant content from the Milestone 4.1 report (Guillaume et al., 2020) which can be \naccessed from the CRDC website for further detail \n58. Ross (2019) reviewed existing policies, legislation and \nregulations that impact on the implementation of MAR operations, with special reference to cotton growing areas in \nNew South Wales and Queensland. \n \nAccess to surface water for recharge operations \nIn NSW, this access is determined by applicable water allocation regulations, notably under the Water Management \nAct (2000) and the Water Management Amendment Act (2018). Water recharge to aquifers becomes part of the \nconsumptive pool and subject to aquifer extraction limits set in water plans. No specific rights are granted to \nrecharged water. The MDBA’s provision for avoiding double counting has not yet been implemented in state policy. \n \nThe NSW Aquifer Interference Policy (AIP) \nAlthough the focus of the policy is primarily on mining activities, there is specific mentions of injection works used to \ntransmit water into an aquifer. In areas covered by a WSP, approved aquifer interference activities (which would \ninclude MAR) require an aquifer access licence and a groundwater use licence for a share of the consumptive pool. \nThe Aquifer Interference Activities approvals mechanism is not currently active 59 but would assist MAR policy by \nbeing able to regulate the volume, timing and quality of water recharged into an aquifer (A. Goulstone pers. comm. \n23 September 2021).  In water sources where water sharing plans do not yet apply, an aquifer interference activity \n(if the mechanism were enabled) would be required to hold a water licence under Part 5 of the Water Act 1912. \nUnder the NSW AIP proponents of aquifer interference activities would need to demonstrate that they can obtain \nthe necessary licences and ensure that minimal impact considerations can be met or propose remedial actions. \nProponents are encouraged to take a risk management approach to assess the potential impacts of aquifer \ninterference activities, with the level of detail proportion to a combination of the likelihood of impacts occurring on \nwater resources uses and dependent ecosystems, and potential consequences of these impacts. \nInfiltration schemes are not explicitly mentioned in the AIP. Infiltration could be classed as an activity that interferes \nwith aquifers, for example in the situation of a shallow aquifer where infiltration might increase the risk of \n                                                            \n58 This report is available from http://www.insidecotton.com/xmlui/handle/1/4874 (accessed 23 September 2021)  \n59 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/science/groundwater/aquifer-interference-activities, accessed 24 September 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n72 \nwaterlogging. However, infiltration into an aquifer that has substantial drawdown and where the recharge volumes \nhave limited effect might not be considered interference.  \n \nThe Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge \nThe Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge (NRMMC et al., 2009) provide \nrecommendations to minimise the effect on water quality, human and environmental health as a result of a new \nMAR project.  The guidelines detail entry-level assessments that should be undertaken to prior to a MAR project \nbeing undertaken, namely a viability assessment and an assessment of the degree of difficulty associated with the \nproject. How this report addresses the components of the viability assessment is outlined in Table 17. The Namoi \nMAR scenarios presents varying degrees of difficulty for MAR, based on the attributes in Table 18, from farm-scale \nMAR for evaporation reduction (Section 4.2) to the more complex sub-regional MAR to alleviate drawdown (Moving \nwater north; Section 4.3) and River recharge as MAR (Section 4.4). \n \n5.7.2 Water Sharing Plans (WSP) covering the AOI  \nThe WSP in force that cover areas in the Namoi Valley are listed in Table 19. This subsection summarises key rules for \nthe WAL in the Upper Namoi and Lower Namoi Regulated River Water Sources 2016 and Water Sharing Plan for the \nNamoi and Peel Unregulated Rivers Water Sources 2012 that might be used as sources of water for MAR. \n \nGeneral security \nIn any one year, the water allocated general security licences will never exceed 1 ML/share (i.e. 100% of entitlement) \n60. A continuous accounting method for general security, such that any remaining water in an allocation account at \nthe end of the water year is carried over. A maximum of 2.0 ML/share of a licence can be held in an account at any \none time. In terms of use limits, the maximum volume that may be taken or traded out in  \n• any 12-month period beginning 1 October is equal to 1.25 ML/share plus any assignment (e.g. allocation \ntrading) into the account during the same period 61.  \n• any 3 consecutive years beginning 1 October is equal to 3 ML/share plus any assignment (e.g. allocation \ntrading) into the account during the same period.  \nCarryover may be restricted under very dry conditions; this occurred on 1 July 2019 where carryover was fully \nsuspended in Lower Namoi and partially suspended (25%) in Upper Namoi until 25 February 2020 (the date of \nrepealment) 62. The volume of suspended carryover held in in a drought holding account will be returned to users \nwhen storage volumes improve. The rules around access of general security water suggest this is not likely to be a \ndesirable or financially viable source of water for MAR. \n \n                                                            \n60 https://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/11986-lower-namoi-regulated-river/rules, accessed 16 September 2021 \n61 https://waterinsights.waternsw.com.au/11986-lower-namoi-regulated-river/rules, accessed 16 September 2021 \n62 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/272154/imposing-restrictions-on-carryover-water-in-regulated-rivers.pdf, \naccessed 16 September 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n73 \nTable 17 Mapping the content of this report against the viability assessment components recommended by the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge entry-level viability \nassessment and this report (NRMMC, EPHC & NHMRC, 2009). \nAttribute from the \nGuidelines \nNotes from Guidelines Assessed in \nthis report \nComments \nIs there a sufficient \ndemand for water? \nThe ongoing volumetric demand for recovered water should be sufficient to warrant investment in the \nproposed project; if this is not the case, there needs to be a clearly defined environmental benefit. Either one \nof these criteria is essential for managed aquifer recharge. Projects involving recharge of partially treated \nwater where recovery is incidental do not qualify as managed aquifer recharge \nYes in 5.1.2 \nand 5.1.3 \n \nIs there an adequate \nsource of water \navailable for allocation \nto recharge? \nEntitlement to water to be used for recharge needs to be secured. Mean annual volume of recharge should \nexceed mean annual demand, with sufficient excess to build up a buffer storage to meet reliability and \nquality requirements. In an already over allocated catchment, an entitlement to surface water is unlikely to \nbe available. \nYes in 5.2.1 to \n5.2.5  \n \nIs there a suitable \naquifer for storage and \nrecovery of the \nrequired volume? \nPresence of a suitable aquifer is critical for managed aquifer recharge. Such an aquifer needs to have an \nadequate rate of recharge and sufficient storage capacity; it also needs to be capable of retaining the water \nwhere it can be recovered. Low salinity and marginally brackish aquifers are preferred, to maximise the \nvolume of recovered water that is fit for use after fresh recharge water mixes with ambient groundwater. \nRegional maps showing the potential of aquifers as storages for managed aquifer recharge have been \ndeveloped for some urban and rural areas, and are available from water resources managers in the local \njurisdiction. In over allocated aquifers, water managers may have additional constraints on the proportion of \nrecharge that may be recovered. \nYes in 5.3.2 \nand 5.3.3 \n \nIs there sufficient space \navailable for capture \nand treatment of the \nwater? \nFor stormwater recharge systems (either open space or dams), wetlands, ponds or basins are needed to \ndetain sufficient water to achieve the target volume of recharge. Similarly, space needs to be available for \nwhatever treatment process, if any, is subsequently determined to be required. For recycled water from a \nsewage treatment plant, generally no additional detention storage will be required at the recharge facility. \nYes in 5.3.1 \nand 5.3.5 \n \nIs there a capability to \ndesign, construct and \noperate a MAR project? \nKnowledge of hydrogeology and water-quality management is vital for the successful design, construction \nand operation of managed aquifer recharge projects. Also necessary for some projects are geotechnical \nknow-how, and expertise in water storage and treatment design, water sensitive urban design, hydrology, \nmonitoring and reporting. Proponents who do not have these skills are encouraged to gain access to them \nbefore proceeding with Stage 2 investigations. The number of consultants experienced in investigations and \ndesign of managed aquifer recharge projects is growing.  \n Development of capacity and skills is a key \ncomponent of the proposed scenarios, as is the \nincremental development of local and subregional \nhydrogeology and groundwater response to \nrecharge. Expertise from across Australia would \nneed to be accessed and leveraged with the aim of \nbuilding local expertise.  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n74 \nTable 18 The Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge entry-level degree of difficulty assessment: attributes to \nconsider. \nAttribute from the guidelines \nDoes source water meet the water-quality requirements for the environmental value of ambient groundwater? \nDoes source water meet the water-quality requirements for the environmental values of the intended end uses of the water \non recovery? \nDoes source water have low quality; for example: total suspended solids >10 mg/L, total organic carbon >10 mg/L, total \nnitrogen >10 mg/L? Also, is the soil or aquifer free of macropores? \nDoes ambient groundwater meet the water- quality requirements for the environmental values of intended end uses of water \non recovery? \nIs either drinking water supply, or protection of aquatic ecosystems with high conservation or ecological values, an \nenvironmental value of the target aquifer? \nDoes the salinity of native groundwater exceed either of the following: (a) 10 000 mg/L, (b) the salinity criterion for uses of \nrecovered water? \nIs redox status, pH, temperature, nutrient status and ionic strength of groundwater similar to that of source water? \nAre there other groundwater users, groundwater-connected ecosystems or a property boundary within 100–1000 m of the \nMAR site? \nIs the aquifer: (a) confined and not artesian?, (b) unconfined, with a water table deeper than 4 m in rural areas or 8 m in \nurban areas? \nIs the aquifer unconfined, with an intended use of recovered water that includes drinking water supplies? \nIs the aquifer composed of fractured rock or karstic media, or known to contain reactive minerals? \nHas another project in the same aquifer with similar source water been operating successfully for at least 12 months? \nDoes the proponent have experience with operating managed aquifer recharge sites with the same or higher degree of \ndifficult, or with water treatment or water supply operations involving a structured approach to water-quality risk \nmanagement? \nDoes the proposed project require development approval? Is it in a built-up area; built on public, flood-prone or steep land; \nor close to a property boundary? Does it contain open water storages or engineering structures; or is it likely to cause public \nhealth or safety issues (e.g. falling or drowning), nuisance from noise, dust, odour or insects (during construction or \noperation), or adverse environmental impacts (e.g. from waste products of treatment processes)? \n \nSupplementary flows \nThe taking of supplementary water in the Lower Namoi is covered by Clause 48 in the Upper Namoi and Lower \nNamoi Regulated River Water Sources 2016. Extractions can only be made from uncontrolled flows that are in excess \nof the replenishment requirements (clause 59) and extractions will be restricted (in part or in full) if outflows from \nthis Source are needed to meet the requirements for flows into the Barwon-Darling system. Rules around the take of \nsupplementary flows are intended to ensure that they do not jeopardise critical environmental needs, basic rights \nholders, or any other of the higher priority WAL types. Subclause (11) prescribes that “the volume of water that may \nbe made available for extraction under supplementary water access licences in the Lower Namoi Regulated River \nWater Source during each supplementary water event”, after 30 June 2019 should not exceed 10% of the \nsupplementary event volume between 1 July and 31 October and 50% of the supplementary event between 1 \nNovember and 30 June. This remains the same in the draft WSP submitted to the MDBA \n63. What has changed are \nthe flow threshold used to define supplementary flows (Table 20 and Table 21). \n \nUnregulated river \nThe access and trading rules for the Spring and Bobbiwaa Creeks water

However, the volume of \nwater taken via floodplain harvesting is considered to have grown to a level that is not sustainable. The policy needs \nto be fully implemented so as to provide an enforceable legal framework that prevents further growth and, in areas \nwhere harvested volumes exceed legal limit, provide a mechanism to reduce take to below the limit 67. \nThe intent of the policy is to bring floodplain harvesting into the alignment with the regulation of take of water from \nother sources. That is water will be taken in “accordance with the individual licensed volumes and legal limits \nprescribed in the Murray–Darling Basin Plan 2012 and NSW water-sharing plans” \n68. Critical to ensuring that accurate \nmeasurements of floodplain harvesting can be made is the requirement that landholders install minimum-standard \ntelemetry-enabled metering devices fitted with tamper-evident seals.   \nAny MAR policy will need to align with the NSW Floodplain Harvesting Policy, particularly where water taken from \nfloodplain harvesting is recharged by irrigators for later recovery. The accurate measurements of water captured in \non-farm storages will need to be matched with the same standard of accounting of the water that is used directly for \nirrigation or that is recharged. \n \n5.7.4 NSW Water Strategy \nThe NSW Government has recently published “a 20-year, state-wide strategy to improve the security, reliability and \nquality of the state’s water resources over the coming decades” (DPIE, 2021). MAR is mentioned under Priority 6 \n(Support resilient, prosperous and liveable cities and towns) as an option that NSW Government is investigating for \nimproving town water security and perhaps the agricultural sector. The specific action (6.8) pertaining to MAR is \nshown in Table 23. \n                                                            \n64 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/nsw-floodplain-harvesting-policy, \naccessed 28 September 2021 \n65 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/improvement-program-for-floodplain-\nharvesting-measurement-and-compliance/about, accessed 28 September 2021 \n66 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/about/legislative-amendments, a \n67 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/faqs, accessed 28 September 2021 \n68 https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/plans-programs/healthy-floodplains-project/improvement-program-for-floodplain-\nharvesting-measurement-and-compliance/about, accessed 28 September 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n78 \nThe maturity of water policy in NSW poses somewhat of a challenge for developing and enacting new policies and \nthe DPIE is currently scoping issues that need to be addressed in the development of the policy. These include (A. \nGoulstone. pers. comm. 23 September 2021):  \n• Options to licence the extraction of MAR water: through the aquifer access WAL currently prescribed in (e.g.) \nthe Namoi Alluvial Groundwater Sources 2020 Plan, OR through creation of a new licence type that is \nseparate from ‘native’ water \n• Links to aquifer interference approvals: this mechanism in the Water Management Act 2000 is yet to be \ncommenced but will assist MAR policy by being able to regulate the volume, timing and quality of water \nrecharged into an aquifer \n• Water accounting changes: Accounting is currently based on annual Available Water Determinations (AWD) \nand water allocation but accounting for MAR will need to consider longer time periods. This is again related \nto distinguishing between native or MAR water and needs to consider implications for ability to trade \n• How and when to apply decay factors reflecting the inability to recover all recharged water \n• Maximum aquifer storage volumes \n• Timing of recharge and recovery: management of issues relating to waterlogging risks and the recovery of \nwater in periods of high demand for groundwater \n• Water quality considerations: management of the health of the receiving water source and establishment of \nmonitoring requirements and governance arrangement \n• Metering and monitoring: determining accepted methods for obtaining accurate information on volumes \nrecharged into an aquifer, particularly for infiltration-based system \n• Establishing priority of access: water access is currently prioritized between users (e.g. environment, critical \nhuman needs, basic landholder rights, licence holders). The priority of recovering MAR in relation to other \naccess/use types needs to be established, both in ‘normal’ conditions and during extreme events \n• Impacts on surface water users: in water sources where surface water allocations are not fully utilized, \nconsideration needs to be given to the risk of MAR leading to a growth in surface water take to a level that \nexceeded a Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) or Long Term Average Annual Extraction Limit (LTAAEL) result \nin reduced AWDs for water access licence holders \n• Identifying legislative changes: Amendments that may be needed to Acts, water sharing plans and/or the \nAquifer Interference Policy \n• Fees and charges: determining the amount and equity of fees and charges that would apply to MAR users \n• System changes: working with WaterNSW (NSW's bulk water supplier and river operator) in relation to \nlicensing requirements, processes and procedures. \nThe intent of the NSW government is that options for implementing a managed aquifer recharge framework in NSW \nwill be analysed in 2021-21 ready for consultation with stakeholders and the community in 2022-23 (refer to NSW \nWater Strategy Implementation Plan, 2021). \n \nTable 23 Investigation into MAR as part of the NSW Water Strategy (DPIE, 2021). \nAction 6.8 Investigate and enable managed aquifer recharge \nThe Government will develop a policy that sets out the framework for MAR in NSW and identify where it is technically and \neconomically viable. We will: \n• identify and implement the legislative changes, accounting, assessment and approval processes that are needed to \nenable MAR to be implemented \n• provide guidance on where MAR could be a feasible option given the scientific and engineering challenges and \npotential environmental implications, particularly for those locations where supplies are vulnerable or where \ndemand is high compared to supply \n• collaborate with research institutions to ensure we have the latest scientific information available to government, \nthe wider community and industries. \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n79 \n6. Synthesis \nThe Lower Namoi was selected as a third and last case study for the project as a region where MAR has long been \ndiscussed but has not yet advanced, with a highly developed irrigated agriculture industry where cotton is an \nimportant irrigated crop. Given the previous work on MAR in the catchment, and in exploring opportunities to move \nMAR forward towards field investigations, this case study experiments with initiating discussion from an operational, \nsite specific perspective on MAR. It focused on an area of previously mapped high MAR suitability between Narrabri \nand Wee Waa in the east of the Lower Namoi groundwater source.  The broad approach taken was to draw on \nevidence from a holistic feasibility assessment to scope the most promising opportunities (“scenarios”) for MAR. The \nfeasibility assessment facilitated the identification and evaluation of three MAR scenarios: \n• MAR for low loss water storage: deliberate recharge and infiltration to increase water available in aquifer \nand reduce evaporative losses  \n• Moving water north: moving water through existing channel infrastructure for recharge targeted at \ndrawdown areas (north of Wee Waa) \n• River recharge as MAR: a transformative shift in water governance and river operations that emphasises \nactive collective management of surface water to recharge aquifers  \nEach scenario is backed up by evidence from analyses against each of the seven criteria for the feasibility of MAR. \n  \n6.1 Key learnings \nThere continues to be opportunities for MAR in the Namoi valley, and with the NSW Water Strategy delivered in \nAugust 2021 there is some impetus for change. However, given the developed nature of the AOI, and the mature \npolicy framework for water management, gains from optimising the status quo through the use of MAR innovations \nare unlikely to provide new water, but rather to provide greater control over where and when water is available. \nTechnical feasibility: The established irrigation industry in the Lower Namoi, with its intricate channel infrastructure \nand many on-farm dams, provides both opportunities and challenges for MAR. The canal system could work to \ntransport water to MAR sites and dams could be used as temporary storages/sedimentation ponds. This, however, \nwould require a significant change in current practice that would require a strong business case to establish the \nbenefits to irrigators for such a change, and cooperation between landholders to minimise unwanted impacts.  \nAquifers in the region are heavily used for irrigation which has resulted in substantial drawdowns, suggesting there is \nspace in the aquifers for recharged water. However, the most effective way to recharge these aquifers in the area of \ninterest is less certain. River recharge is a major contributor but its management represents a transformative change \nfor the region. Paleochannels are known to exist in the region but high system heterogeneity highlights the need for \nlocal knowledge to target suitable locations.  \nFinancial viability: Past studies have suggested that infiltration-based MAR schemes could be financially competitive \nwith surface storage options in the Lower Namoi. Factors such as (expected) increases in surface evaporation rates \nincrease the viability of MAR. As reiterated in the scenarios developed here, further development of the business \ncase for MAR requires further quantification of current system losses and discussion of management and \ngovernance arrangements for sharing of costs, benefits and regulation of MAR. \nGovernance arrangements: There is not yet a MAR specific policy in NSW, although the NSW Government recently \npublished the NSW Water Strategy which includes plans to analyse options for implementing a managed aquifer \nrecharge framework in NSW for consultation with stakeholders and the community. The use of MAR pilots, which \ncan go ahead under current regulations, is critical to inform policy as well as technical expertise. Current policy \nindirectly associated with MAR includes the Aquifer Interference Policy, while the published Australian Guidelines for \nWater Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge can already inform future MAR policy and associated assessments.  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n80 \n6.2 Enabling environment for MAR \nStemming from this case study, the general recommendations for CRDC, State government, landholders and/or \nother parties are to:  \n• Build a culture of and capacity for understanding groundwater dynamics at farm scale, and infiltration and \nrecharge at field and channel scale.  \n• Invest in pilot studies of MAR that develop regulatory and farm management understanding of recharge \nconsistent with water accounting requirements. \n• Engage in the development of the policy framework for MAR within the NSW strategy to ensure that water \nsharing plan, pilot project, and collective management options remain possible in future. \n• Explore the range of possible paradigms for managing aquifers as reservoirs to minimise impacts and \nmaximise benefits \nA staged approach to operationalising and implementing these recommendations should target initial no-regret \nactions that minimise initial investment and provide value regardless of which management paradigm and MAR \ninnovation are later pursued. In principle, as the value of water increases, telemetry and automation have the \npotential to dramatically increase understanding of an irrigation system, provide savings through condition-based or \npredictive asset maintenance, and in the process yield high resolution understanding of infiltration and evaporation. \nSimilarly, increasing farm data availability increases the benefits of information sharing and greater involvement of \nfarmers and other emerging data holders in regulatory review and development processes. Investing in precision \nagriculture water management could therefore lay the groundwork for MAR in future.  \nAll scenarios developed for the Namoi case study rely on the establishment of organisational structures and research \nand development support that will gradually increase local to subregional hydrogeological understanding. They place \nan emphasis on enhancing the ability of irrigators to evaluate the costs and benefits (in relation to the farm water \nbalance and enterprise resilience) of proposed changes to their operational water management. There is a need for \nmulti-stakeholder efforts to experiment with new regulatory frameworks and policy innovation niches that support \nsustainable irrigation industries. These are changes that would also be desirable more widely to improve capacity for \nwhole-of-system water management in NSW and Australia. MAR is an ideal case to develop this improvement in \ngovernance but would also benefit from investments in improvements through other pathways, including through \ngreater cooperation in operational water delivery or regional system efficiency improvement mechanisms.   \n \n \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Namoi: Final case study report \n \n81 \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was funded by the Cotton Research & Development Corporation (CRDC).

The broad aim of the project case \nstudies was to evaluate how MAR might be feasible for irrigated cotton production and associated \ncropping systems in the focus regions, and make recommendations on further work to evaluate local \nhydrogeological conditions, plan the necessary site-specific infrastructure, and establish the legal, social \nand organisational conditions for implementation of MAR. \nThe focus of this report is the second case study of the MAR feasibility project, the Gilbert River \nAgricultural Precinct (GRAP) in the Gilbert River catchment.  The study has concentrated on identifying how \npotential interventions that might provide timely and reliable water yields from the alluvial bed sands \nadjacent to the Gilbert River might work, and what information would be needed to support investment in \nthe sustainable active management of bed sands.  \nThe broad approach taken was to draw on evidence from a holistic feasibility assessment to scope the \nmost promising opportunities (“scenarios”) for MAR, within an active management paradigm, and to test \nand refine these scenarios with local stakeholders and state government stakeholders. The key questions \nwe have addressed in the context of seven feasibility criteria are: \n1. How might potential strategies (e.g., leaky weirs, recharge weirs, infiltration basins) be applied in \nthe Gilbert River to maximise storage, top up and/or slow down drainage from the bed sands to \nprovide water for irrigation when needed?  \n2. What are the policy and implementation implications of active management of bed sands? What \nenvironmental, social and/or hydrological impacts would need to be tracked?  \n3. How could an active management approach operate? What governance and information sharing \narrangements might be needed? \nIn addressing these questions, we have identified limitations in the current conceptualisations used in the \nmodels underpinning Water Resource Plans (WRP) for the Gulf catchments and, from this, opportunities to \nimprove conceptual understanding of the bed sands.  \n \nActive management of bed sands \nBed sands are already in use for agriculture and other purposes, though water policy would need to change \nto permit use for storage and later extraction. Governance of water in the Gilbert catchment provides \nopportunity to obtain new water entitlements. The current flow conditions required for granting of \nentitlements from general unallocated water reserves do not allow water extraction during low flows in \nthe dry season, limits time available for water extraction and MAR and so additional legislation would need \nto be considered when planning water development.  \nActive management is proposed to make progress without complete and perfect information, by building \nunderstanding over time and stewardship of the water resources. Such an approach would avoid lock-in to \nparticular interventions but would provide transparency and vision to attract investment. Active \nmanagement of the alluvial bed sands would require shifting to a regulatory system where rules are based \non staying within pre-defined conditions rather than limiting extraction directly. It has the potential to \nallow incremental change from existing use subject to demonstrable acceptable impacts from a water \nprovision, social licence and environmental risk perspective.  \n \nii \n \nOpportunities for MAR in the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct \nPotential recharge strategies \nRecharge strategies aim to increase infiltration or delay outflows in local areas of the bed sands. Leaky \nweirs aim to slow the flow of water to rehydrate the land; they could possibly be constructed across small \nstreams off the Gilbert River. Recharge weirs aim to slow flows in order to increase recharge into \nunconfined aquifers. Multiple recharge weirs could be installed along one or multiple river courses in a \ncatchment (allowing for incremental development) and possible locations could be small streams off \nGilbert River targeting the horizontal extent of bed sands. Infiltration basins aim to recharge unconfined \naquifers through pumping or diverting water from the river into off stream storage. In the Gilbert, possible \nlocations are the bed sand deposits that extend beyond the river channel. Recharge release is a strategy \nsuggested by CSIRO FGARA reports in other North Queensland catchments, which would work in \nconjunction with the proposed Greenhills Dam to service the bed sands downstream of the dam (through \nto Strathmore). The aim would be to strategically release surface water from dams for infiltration through \nthe downstream natural river channel and the dam would act as a settling pond (treatment). The siting of \ninfrastructure needs to account for site-specific hydrogeological and hydraulic properties, as well as \npracticalities, including access and site- and infrastructure-specific impacts of wet season flows. \n \nScenario: Farm-scale MAR \nMAR, on a single farm and run by an individual owner or land manager, would use the bed sands to \nprovide supplementary irrigation at the start of the dry season, and would actively manage the local bed \nsands to maximise water availability with targeted recharge infrastructure and adjustments to pumping \nregimes and locations. This would be an incremental change for existing spear bore users, but may require \nsubstantial investment, planning, and approvals for prospective new users. In addition to actively tracking \nspear bore water levels, new monitoring to plan these changes would be primarily led by the landholder, \nbut may involve partnership with other landholders and organisations. Collaboration between local \nstakeholders and government would work towards establishing appropriate rules for recharge and later \nextraction of surface water into bed sands, approvals for the establishment or replacement of \ninfrastructure, and monitoring of impacts. \nAs the bed sands are intended as an actively managed storage of entitlements managed under the Water \nPlan (Gulf) 2007, the alternative to farm-scale MAR is investment in off-stream surface water storages (e.g. \ngully dams or ring tanks). Construction of off-stream storages is an established technology with defined \ninstitutional and compliance procedures. While previous work has noted the high infiltration and \nevapotranspiration rates, infiltration could benefit bed sands and losses from short term storages may be \nacceptable for the purpose of finishing crops and bridging events. At farm scale, different farms may \nbenefit from different storage solutions. \n \nScenario: Regional-scale MAR \nA regional scale MAR scheme, that could provide sufficient water to irrigate an area of cotton that would \nsupport a viable gin in the region, would utilise water entitlements set aside under the Gulf Water Plan as a \ngeneral reserve to support water infrastructure for regional development. Existing new cotton planting \noutside the GRAP means that substantial reductions in transport costs may be achieved even if the gin is \nnot located in Georgetown, and that the Gilbert River would not need to be the sole water source. The \noperation of the MAR scheme could be achieved through the establishment of an organisation that would \npartner with other agencies but ultimately operate on a user pays cost recovery basis based on assessable \narea charges from the agriculture industry. Investments in studies to improve understanding of the aquifer \nstorage capacity of the alluvial sands would over time build knowledge and capacity in the region for \nmanaging water in the bed sands, allowing local and state governments to play a more active role in \niii \n \nassisting landholders to plan and coordinate their pumping from bed sands, and address risks associated \nwith pumping riverbeds dry during the dry season and recharging during high flows.  \nAn alternative (without MAR) is the proposed Greenhills dam that would service the Gilbert River Irrigation \nProject (GRIP); a Detailed Business Case (DBC) was prepared for this scheme in 2020 although it has not yet \nprogressed to preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). While the supply capacity of the \nbed sands is still uncertain, it is likely that the capacity of Greenhills dam would be on the order of 10 times \nlarger, such that a focus on bed sands development would imply a smaller agricultural development or an \nincremental development as part of a whole-of-system view of dry season water storage. \nThe third scenario for a regional scale irrigation scheme would combine MAR and the proposed Greenhills \ndam. The dam could be used as a temporary storage or sedimentation tank prior to releasing water to \nrecharge the alluvial river sands. Alternately, the dam could be used to deliver immediate water demands \nfrom entitlements with the excess used to recharge bed sands using MAR, for extraction in the dry season \nor in years of low rainfall. Impacts from recharge and pumping the sand beds in the dry season would need \nto be tracked. The states to be monitored, and the information and infrastructure needed to do so, to \nidentify unacceptable impacts from the dam, recharge releases and riverbed pumping are as for the \nregional-scale MAR scenario.  \n \nImproved conceptualisation of river bed sand aquifers adjacent to the Gilbert River \nThere are multiple possible options to explore regarding the use of water from bed sands but any actions \nare currently constrained by concerns about risks. Regulation cannot be relaxed without better identifying \nrisks, but obtaining better information about the system can also help better articulate water needs and \nopportunity, and optimise existing pumping. Investment in monitoring and improving conceptual \nunderstanding of the bed sands and their representation in river models used in water management in the \nGulf region would likely also benefit impact assessment for any dam, and develop and demonstrate \nstewardship capabilities for sustainable development of the resource.  \n \nRecommendations \nGiven the early stage of agricultural development and knowledge of bed sands dynamics, the first step \ntowards implementation of managed aquifer recharge and active management of the bed sands as a water \nstorage involves 1) improving knowledge systems, and 2) elaboration of management arrangements. The \nscenarios operate at multiple scales in terms of stakeholders involved and consideration of storage \nsolutions beyond the bed sands. Similarly, recommendations cover next steps that can be taken at multiple \nscales from both knowledge and management perspectives (Table 1). While the recommendations were \ndeveloped with a focus on the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct, the recommendations also apply to other \nmonsoonal areas with bed sands at a similar stage of agricultural development and scientific knowledge. \n \n \n \niv \n \nTable 1 Recommendations for agents of change in the Gilbert catchment at multiple levels \n Landholders Local organisations, \nincluding Etheridge \nShire Council, Gulf \nSavannah Natural \nResource \nManagement Group \nState government R&D organisations \n(e.g., CRDC) \nImproving \nknowledge \nsystems \nEvaluate current \nwater use \narrangements, \nespecially spear \nbore use; plan \nmonitoring to \nresolve gaps and \nidentify \nimprovements \nBuild capacity for site-\nspecific assessment \nand planning of water \nstorage management, \nincluding regional \ndatasets \nPartner to improve monitoring, \nconceptualisation and \nmodelling of bed sands and \nassociated impacts to inform \nassessment of active \nmanagement arrangements \nBuild capacity for \nlandholder \ngroundwater use and \nstatus monitoring, and \nmonsoonal water \nstorage options \nassessment \nElaboration of \nmanagement \narrangements \nKeep records of \nwater levels and use \nof spear bores and \nconsider \nopportunities to \nshare information \nand collaborate on \nplanning \nInvestigate possible \nbusiness models and \nscope of a potential \nlocal water \nmanagement \norganisation, \nconsidering possible \npartnerships and a \nsystems view of \nstorage options \nCo-design requirements for \nMAR, including active \nmanagement of bed sands, for \nconsideration in 2027 review of \nthe Gulf Water Plan (2007).

Introduction \n1.1 The Australian cotton industry \nThe cotton industry is an important sector of Australia’s agricultural and rural landscape. The industry is \nfocused mainly on the south-east coast, from central and southern Queensland (QLD), throughout New \nSouth Wales (NSW) and into northern Victoria1. However, emerging cotton growing areas can be found in \nNorth Australia2. The majority of cotton farms are family owned and the industry employ over 12,000 \npeople3. Australia cotton is exported around the world, with average earnings of $2 billion annually4. \n    \n1.2 The implications of water reforms and climate variability on irrigated cotton production \nThe majority of cotton is produced from irrigated systems. In the past, the high water use of the Australian \ncotton industry attracted criticism, but the industry is now one of the most water efficient cotton \nindustries in the world5. Between 2002 and 2012, the industry increased yields as a result of improved crop \nmanagement, advances in plant breeding and the adoption of genetically modified varieties, while being \nmore efficient users of water. These changes improved industry wide water use efficiency (WUE) by 40% \n(Roth et al., 2014). Select examples of farm management changes that lead to the observed improvements \nin WUE, described in The Australian Grown Cotton Sustainability Report 2014 (Cotton Australia and CRDC, \n2014), include:  \n• A 30% increase in the use of soil moisture probes since 2006, which are now used by 70% of \nirrigators  \n• 96% of furrow irrigation systems have been improved or changed to alternative systems  \n• 49% of irrigators have updated the flow or size of siphons  \n• 35% of irrigators have redesigned fields; for example, decreasing the distance between dams and \nfields to reduce evaporation losses  \nEven after the recent improvements in WUE, irrigated cotton production varies substantially between \nyears (Figure 1), depending on water volumes available for irrigation (Cotton Australia and CRDC, 2014). \nThe gross value of cotton lint is strongly associated with the area of irrigated crop production (Figure 2), \ndecreasing in times of low water availability (Cotton Australia and CRDC, 2014). It follows that a key \nlimiting factor on the cotton industry in Australia is water security, exacerbated by the potential for further \npolicy changes to water access and entitlements and future climate unknowns.    \nOn average, groundwater contributes 15% of water used for the production of irrigated cotton (Cotton \nAustralia and CRDC, 2014). In dry periods, dependence on groundwater to increases. Managed aquifer \nrecharge (MAR) could be used in this context by the Australian cotton industry; as a management strategy \nin the face of future surface water scarcity. Is it also possible that MAR has a place in ‘greenfield’ \nproduction areas to increase water security from the onset of industry development, limiting the \nunintended water scarcity seen in established regions.            \n                                                       \n1 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n2 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n3 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n4 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \n5 https://cottonaustralia.com.au/industry-overview, accessed 30 August 2020 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n2 \n  \n \n \n \n1.3 A brief history of cotton production in Northern Australia  \nCotton production in North Australia has been both spatially and temporally limited, due to a number of \nfactors (Matz, 2020, Andrews, 2015). \nThe Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) in Western Australia (WA) was initiated in the 1960s and included wet \nseason cotton production (Matz, 2020). Issues relating to poor quality and pest damage resulted in \ncommercial cotton production ceasing by the mid-1970s (Ash and Watson, 2018). Recently, there has been \nrenewed interest in cotton in the region with the focus of research and development on dry season \ncropping where planting occurs in February and harvesting in October (Matz, 2020). This change in season \navoids damage from pest species that contributed to the failure of cotton crops during the 1960s and \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n3 \n1970s, particularly Spodoptera cluster caterpillars and pink bollworm (Yeates et al., 2014). Production \npotential has also benefited from the development of transgenic cotton varieties, and the ongoing \nbreeding of shorter season cotton varieties that are better suited to the north (Matz, 2020).  \nRecent research and development into cotton production in north west Queensland, including the Gilbert \ncatchment, has focused on collaborative trials with growers and researchers (Matz, 2020). Despite interest \nin the potential of cotton, the current lack of production in this region of Queensland is attributed to \nsignificant transports costs resulting from distant processing facilities as well as a lack of year round water \navailability (Matz, 2020). \n      \n1.4 A brief history of MAR schemes in Australia \nMAR involves the purposeful recharging of aquifers using surface water, whether from rivers and other \nwater bodies or recycled water, to be extracted when needed. Overseas MAR has been used to increase \nwater security, with interest in MAR continuing to grow in Australia. MAR projects in Australia date back to \nthe 1960s and the focus of these schemes are mostly urban (Dillon, 2009); MAR remains in its infancy in \nAustralia in an agricultural setting.  \nSouth Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA) are home to the majority of Australia’s MAR schemes \n(Dillon, 2009). The longest running MAR project in Australia is in Queensland’s Burdekin Delta. The \ninfiltration based system has maintained groundwater levels in the regions, preventing the intrusion of \nseawater, for decades (Dillon, 2009). Infiltration systems have also been used in WA since the 1980s as a \nway to recycle wastewater to irrigate public spaces, including playing fields (Vanderzalm et al., 2015). \nMultiple regions in SA inject stormwater runoff into aquifers, to be recovered as a water supply for \nirrigation and industry (Barnett et al., 2000, Miotliński et al., 2014, Yuan et al., 2016). Several MAR sites \naround Adelaide (SA) treat stormwater via artificial wetlands before injection into saline aquifers (Barnett \net al., 2000). Water recovered as part of this project is of reduced salinity compared to the levels of the \nnative aquifer, and can be used for irrigation purposes (Barnett et al., 2000). The Salisbury aquifer storage \ntreatment and recovery (ASTR) scheme in SA spatially separates injection and recovery wells, allowing for \nthe treatment of injected water during residence in the aquifer (Miotliński et al., 2014, Yuan et al., 2016). \nPre-injection artificial wetlands are used to filter out total suspended soils, reducing clogging of wells (Yuan \net al., 2016).   \nThe MAR schemes currently operating in Australia show that well-planned projects can be successful. \nAlthough uptake in agricultural settings is limited, some have suggested that more MAR developments \nwould increase water storage capacity and water security in a way that is economically viable compared to \ndams and other surface storages (Dillon, 2009, Khan et al., 2008). \n                         \n1.5 The MAR Feasibility project \nThe ‘Feasibility study of managed aquifer recharge for improved water productivity for Australian cotton \nproduction’ project (here-on-in referred to as the MAR Feasibility project) was funded by the Cotton \nResearch and Development Corporation (CRDC) to investigate the feasibility of MAR at a regional scale in \nestablished and developing cotton growing regions in Australia. MAR has been discussed as an option in \ncotton regions previously, so the MAR Feasibility project has focused on whether MAR is a more feasible \noption then the current or alternate surface water options. Seven feasibility criteria based on those \ndeveloped by Ticehurst and Curtis (2017) are used in conjunction with scenario development. Further \nresearch and resources should be directed to the more feasible options (scenarios), whether it be MAR or \nother water management options. \nThree case study regions were selected in consultation with the project steering committee: the \nMurrumbidgee region in southern NSW, the Namoi region in northern NSW and the Gilbert region in \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n4 \nnorthern Queensland (Figure 3). The Namoi and Murrumbidgee regions were selected as representing \nagricultural settings where the likelihood of MAR being feasible should be high, based on what was \npreviously known about these systems across the different feasibility criteria. If the outcomes of these case \nstudies did not support MAR, it would suggest that MAR should be ruled out as a water management \noption for the cotton industry. The Gilbert case study, however, considers the feasibility of using MAR in a \nregion with relatively small extent of agricultural development, and where there is the potential to \ncompare MAR against traditional surface water storage options before large-scale water development.  \n \n \nFigure 3 Location of the project case study areas. This report focuses on the Gilbert case study.  \nNorthern Australia has previously been highlighted as a region suited to the development of an irrigated \nagriculture industry, with cotton identified as a potential crop option (Petheram et al., 2013, Queensland, \n2007). In Queensland, most focus has been on surface water storage infrastructure with the exceptions \nbeing the MAR scheme in the Burdekin Delta and more recently the CSIRO Northern Australia Water \nResource Assessment project in the Mitchell catchment (Petheram et al., 2018). The potential benefits of \nMAR to irrigated agriculture industry in northern Queensland is two-fold. Storing water underground will \navoid the evaporative losses experienced when using surface storages. The recharged water can then be \nextracted to even out the seasonal difference in water supply seen in North Australia which would enhance \ncertainty to a developing sector. The need for sustainable development, that considers environmental, \ncultural and community aspects, as well as financial gain, has been highlighted (Petheram et al., 2013, \nBarber, 2018, Waltham et al., 2013, Crossman and Bark, 2013). The feasibility criteria used in this \nassessment aims to address the above aspects, which a focus on sustainability over all criteria. \n \nGilbert\nNamoi\nMurrumbidgee\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n5 \n1.6 Structure of this report \nThe Gilbert River case study seeks to investigate and resolve some uncertainties associated with potential \nirrigation development in northern Australia by identifying plausible options for investment in conjunctive \nuse of surface and groundwater and agro-ecological approaches to irrigated agriculture. Past investigations \nhave focused primarily on surface water schemes, with groundwater considerations limited to impacts of \nthe surface water schemes on the groundwater system. This report draws on existing investigations and \nstakeholder expertise to critically assess the potential feasibility of MAR in the region and to identify next \nsteps for research and development to guide investment by government or other funders. The approach \nand methods used to assess the feasibility of MAR is provided in Section 2. This is followed in Section 3 by a \ndescription of the Gilbert River catchment system and the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP), which \nis the focus of the case study. Five scenarios representing MAR options or alternative surface water storage \noptions are identified and evaluated in Section 4. The development and evaluation of these scenarios drew \non the detailed results of the feasibility criteria assessment provided in Section 5. This research has \nidentified that limitations in the conceptualisation of river bed sands in available river system models \nconstrains the extent to which impacts of MAR on (or extraction of water from) bed sands can be assessed. \nSection 6, therefore, considers how this conceptualisation could be improved in future water modelling \nand management. The report concludes in Section 7 with a statement of the potential for MAR in the \nregion and recommendations for the CRDC and local and state-level stakeholders going forward. \n  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n6 \n2. Overarching approach \nAn argumentation approach has been used to guide the case study development. This reflects the high \nuncertainty in both project requirements and consequences associated with MAR innovations. A staged \napproach is more suitable in these situations, rather than trying to eliminate all uncertainty in one go. By \nfirstly using available information to identify whether it’s worth taking the next step in investigating the \ninnovation, strategies that incrementally address critical uncertainties around the potential innovation can \nbe identified. In this case study, our intent is to identify scenarios that support the hypothesis that MAR \ncould be part of an irrigation development strategy centred on conjunctive use that supports a culturally \nand socially acceptable, environmentally sensitive, and viable irrigated agriculture industry. The questions \nguiding the 11 steps of the argumentation approach are shown in Figure 4; while represented as distinct \nsteps in the diagram the process was highly iterative and underpinned by engagement throughout the \nduration of the case study.  \n \nFigure 4 Argumentation approach used to investigate the potential feasibility of MAR in the Gilbert River case study.  \nThe Framing phase identifies what we could achieve in the project, who needed to be convinced of the \npotential viability of MAR (the ‘agents of change’), and what part of the Gilbert River catchment we would \nfocus on. With no scope to conduct in-depth field research, this project centred on analysis of existing \ninvestigations, the development of scenarios, and the conceptualisation of bed sand aquifers. Given the \nrelatively small extent of irrigated agriculture and the limited exposure to MAR as a concept in the region, \nthe project needs to convince investors/funding bodies, state government representatives or local \ngovernment representatives that MAR is worth investigating further as a development strategy. This in \nturn requires addressing any concerns around social license, environmental impacts and water \ngovernance. The case study considers both farm-level and regional MAR within the area covered by the \nGRAP.  \nIn the Scenario development phase, we developed MAR innovation scenarios and alternate scenarios that \ndo not have a MAR component. These scenarios were supported by a systematic feasibility criteria \nassessment against the seven feasibility criteria of (Ticehurst and Curtis, 2017): Demand for Water, Water \navailability, Technical feasibility, Financial viability, Environmental risks, Social acceptability & social license, \nand Governance arrangements. This assessment involved the synthesis of available literature and data for \nthe system; key resources are listed in Table 2. Initial investigations highlighted that the bed sands of the \nGilbert River were the most promising aquifer system for MAR. From this, we explored how interventions \nthat aim to provide timely and reliable water yields from the alluvial bed sands adjacent to the Gilbert \nRiver might work.

Over the life of the case study, we engaged with state government \nagencies (RDMW, DAF), CSIRO, the Etheridge Shire Council (ESC), the Gulf Savannah Natural Resource \nManagement Group (GSNRM), the chair of the Tagalaka Aboriginal Corporation RTNBC, and local \nlandholders (through two phone interviews and in-person at the Gilbert River Agricultural Forum facilitated \nby the ESC). \nWe have built upon the current representation of bed sands used in the models underpinning Water \nResource Plans (WRP) for the Gulf catchments. This improved conceptual model of the alluvial aquifers in \nthe Gilbert River catchment could inform future work aimed at improving the capacity to represent river \nbed sands in water management models of the Gilbert River system. It could help communicate how, over \ntime and space, the bed sands fill and empty and the nature and extent of impacts of current and future \nextractions of water from these alluvial systems.  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n8 \n3. Gilbert River catchment \n3.1 Background \nThe Gilbert River catchment, with a catchment area of approximately 46,354 km2 (Webster et al., 2013), \ndrains into the Gulf of Carpentaria in North Queensland (Figure 5). Neighbouring catchments, collectively \ntermed the Gulf region, include Settlement Creek, Nicholson, Leichhardt, Morning Inlet, Flinders, Norman, \nGilbert, Staaten, Mitchell and Coleman (Figure 5).  \n \n \nFigure 5 Gilbert catchment, Gulf region and Flinders catchment (Source: Petheram et al., 2013).  \nThe climate in the Gulf region is hot, semi-arid and highly seasonal, with two distinct seasons, wet and dry \n(Figure 6). The wet season is the six-months between 1 November and 30 April, with the dry season from 1 \nMay to 31 October. Average annual rainfall in the catchment is 755 mm (Figure 7), with 93% falling during \nthe wet season (Petheram et al., 2013). Rainfall variation between years is high (Figure 7). Generally, \nrainfall declines moving away from the coast, but is also highly localised. Potential evaporation is more \nthan double the average annual rainfall, over 1800 mm/year (Petheram et al., 2013). The Gilbert \ncatchment is not immune to the dry spells experienced elsewhere in Australia, with dry periods of similar \nlength but greater intensity then other parts (i.e. south-east and south-western Australia) (Petheram et al., \n2013).  \nA range of soil types are present in the Gilbert catchment (Figure 8), reflecting the various geologies and \ngeological process in the area (Section 5.3.2).  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n9 \nThe surface hydrology of Gilbert is driven by the strong seasonality of the climate and high evaporation \nrates. The two major rivers in the catchment are the Einasleigh and Gilbert (Figure 9), with an average \ncombined streamflow of 3706 GL/year and a median of 2585 GL/year (Petheram et al., 2013). The large \nvariation between mean and median streamflow illustrates the large impact that years of very high \nstreamflow (associated with high rainfall) have on skewing the mean. Many of the rivers and their \ntributaries are ephemeral, flowing less than 50% of the time (Petheram et al., 2013). This can be observed \nin the hydrograph from the middle reaches of the Gilbert (Figure 10). During the dry season, these rivers \nand creeks form a series of waterholes, most of which are uninfluenced by groundwater inflows based on \nion and isotope analysis (Petheram et al., 2013, Jolly et al., 2013). However, some locations in the mid-\nreaches of the Gilbert River suggested a high likelihood of groundwater inflow at both river and waterhole \nsampling sites (Figure 4.2, Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 in Jolly et al. (2013)).  \nAlthough groundwater resources and recharge are poorly understood in the area, it has been suggested \nthat groundwater resources are limited and that recharge rates are low over the majority of the \ncatchment, albeit with localised areas of high recharge rates. This is further explored in Section 5.3.1.    \n \n  \nFigure 6 (a) Monthly rainfall and (b) monthly potential evaporation, based on data from 1890 – 2011, average across the Gilbert catchment. \nThe A range is the 20th to 80th percentile exceedance (Source: Petheram et al., 2013). \n  \nFigure 7 (a) Mean annual rainfall and (b) mean annual potential evaporation, based on data from 1890 – 2011, average across the Gilbert \ncatchment.

Data source: https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/  \nThe Indigenous nations present in the Gilbert catchment are Tagalaka, Ewamian, and Kurtijar peoples \n(Petheram et al., 2013). The traditional owners of the land, rivers, and saltwater country in the south-east \nGulf of Carpentaria are the Kurtijar People (https://kurtijaraboriginalcorporation.com.au/, accessed 12 \nMay 2021). Tagalaka Country covers Gulf Savannah lands around the townships of Croydon, Normanton \nand East Hayden (https://www.tagalaka.com/who-we-are, accessed 12 May 2021). The Country of the \nEwamian peoples are the savannah lands in the upper Gilbert and Einasleigh River catchments, primarily \nlying within the Etheridge Shire Local Government Area (https://www.ewamian.com.au/countryculture, \naccessed 12 May 2021). \nCovering the Etheridge Shire and part of the Carpentaria shire, the Gilbert catchment has a population of \napproximately 1,200 people (Petheram et al., 2013). The largest town in the catchment, Georgetown, has a \npopulation of 301 (based on 2016 census data) 6. \nThe two key ecological considerations in the area are wetland connectivity through flooding in the wet \nseason and waterhole persistence in the dry season (Petheram et al., 2013). The coastal floodplains of the \nGilbert flood regularly (Figure 11). These floods serve an important ecological purpose, allowing for \nconnection and nutrient exchange between the main channel and normally disconnected wetlands. \nHowever, flooding can cause damage to crops and infrastructure. Many of the rivers in the Gilbert are \nephemeral, breaking up during the dry season into the series of waterholes (Figure 12). These waterholes \nprovide refugee for many aquatic species to survive the dry season.   \nThe major activity in the region is pastoralism (cattle grazing), with tourism, mining and commercial fishing \nalso economically important (Petheram et al., 2013). Cropping, both dryland and irrigated, are smaller \ncontributors, occupying less than 0.02% of the landscape (Petheram et al., 2013).

The \nclosest cotton gin is ~ 900 km south-east in Emerald. However, there has been a growing interest to \nestablish an irrigated agriculture industry in the catchment (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020), but the \nephemeral nature of most rivers in the catchment requires the storage of water during the wet season for \nirrigation during the dry season is to take place (Petheram et al., 2013).  \n \n \nFigure 11 Flood inundation in the Gilbert Catchment, based on MODIS data from 2000 – 2010 (Source: Petheram et al., 2013). \n3.2 Water infrastructure, regulation and use \n Current situation \nThe rivers of the Gilbert are largely unregulated, with one large instream dam (20.6 GL) in the catchment \nlocated on the Copperfield River near Kidston, 60km south of Einasleigh 7. The Kidston Dam (Figure 13), \nofficially the Copperfield River Gorge Dam (Table 3), was constructed in 1984 to provide water for the now \nclosed Kidston gold mine (Petheram et al., 2013). The dam is now managed by Queensland Department of \nResources, providing stock and domestic water to limited downstream properties and some homes in \nKidston via the original mine supply pipeline (Petheram et al., 2013). The dam is also used for recreational \nactivities (e.g. fishing) 8.  \n                                                       \n7 https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/water/catchments/state-owned-dams, accessed 16 June 2020 \n8 https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/water/catchments/state-owned-dams, accessed 16 June 2020 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n13 \n \n \nFigure 12 Waterholes in the Gilbert catchment.

Due to the large seasonality of \nthe catchment and substantial differences in rainfall between years it was not uncommon for water to be \nseverely limited by the end of the dry season and during rainfall years (Cummings, 2015). In extreme \ncircumstances, water has been carted in by truck to maintain minimum supplies for the town (Cummings, \n2015). The situation, prior to construction of the Charleston Dam, was that the water infrastructure in the \ncatchment did not allow for substantial population or industry growth (Cummings, 2015). \nThe Charleston Dam, downstream of Forsayth and upstream of Georgetown on the Delaney River 9,10, was \ncompleted in late 2020. The purpose of the dam is primarily water supply to both towns with the provision \nof recreational facilities a secondary benefit 11. However, local agriculture, as well as other industries, have \nalso been suggested as beneficiaries of the project 12.  Town water licences were granted from the Gilbert \nRiver strategic reserve and the granting of a water licence for the dam was associated with release of \nwater from strategic reserve in accordance with the Water Resource (Gulf) Plan 2007 rules.   \nLandholders within the Gilbert catchment currently hold 40 GL of allocations (Table 8), however, very little \nof this is used for irrigated agriculture (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). The cropping that does occur \ncommonly uses water drawn from aquifers in the sand beds of the Gilbert River (Cummings, 2015), which \nis classed as surface water and managed under the Gulf Water Plan. There is currently an open unallocated \nwater release process 13 although uptake has been low (see Section 5.2).  \nIn the Gilbert catchment, the use of groundwater resources managed under the Great Artesian Basin and \nother regional aquifers (GABORA) water plan is primarily for stock and domestic purposes; bores for this \nuse do not have associated entitlements. The one (out of 507) registered bores that does have authorised \nuse for irrigation purposes has an entitlement of 13 ML per water year (see Section 5.2). \n \n Planned Changes to Water Infrastructure \nThere are proposed projects intended to allow for the development of an irrigated agriculture industry in \nthe Gilbert catchment, to support both the community and economy in the region.  \nLarge-scale surface water irrigated developments are limited to relatively few locations (Ash and Watson, \n2018). The largest streamflows are typically in lower parts of the catchments that are of low relief; they are \n                                                       \n9 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/development/economic-development/charleston-dam, accessed 20 August 2020 \n10 https://www.northweststar.com.au/story/6757066/charleston-dam-gets-3m-from-feds-to-complete-the-project/, accessed \n20 August 2020 \n11 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/development/economic-development/charleston-dam, accessed 20 August 2020 \n12 https://www.northweststar.com.au/story/6757066/charleston-dam-gets-3m-from-feds-to-complete-the-project/, accessed \n20 August 2020 \n13 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, \naccessed 29 November 2021 \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n15 \nunsuitable for dams and prone to seasonal flooding and secondary salinisation. In upper reaches of the \ncatchment, rainfall tends to be lower and the catchment upstream of the potential impoundments that are \ncapable of storing large volumes of water. The locally preferred site is that of the the Gilbert River \nIrrigation Project (GRIP) 14. This scheme would deliver 130 GL of water entitlements per year, split into \nboth high and medium priority allocations (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). The irrigation area hoping \nto be developed as a result of this project is the fertile soils that run along the Gilbert River, downstream of \nthe dam, with a total area of 17,900 ha (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). Community and economic \nbenefits of this project are the diversification of industry in the area, which is currently dominated by cattle \ngrazing, and the creation of new jobs, which would slow or reverse the current decreases in population \nseen in the region (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). A local Indigenous Cooperation has given their \nsupport for the GRIP 15.  \nThe dam wall is planned to cross the Gilbert River about 3.5 km downstream of the Carnes Road crossing \n(Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). The total storage capacity of the dam will be 323,577 ML, inundating \nan area of 5,847 ha. The area to be inundated is currently used for cattle grazing (Jacobs Australia Pty \nLimited., 2020).  \nHowever, to support the construction of large dams (or other water infrastructure) in the catchment there \nis a need for water to be available to be stored. Under the Gulf Water Pan, there is the potential for up to \n467,000 ML of water entitlements to be issued from general reserve, for example to support water \ninfrastructure (Section 5.2.3), as well as smaller allocations available for individuals (Section 5.2.2). Section \n5.2 provide further details on water availability to support both water infrastructure and irrigated \nagriculture enterprises. \n      \n3.3 Farming systems in the north  \nDue to the greenfields nature of the Gilbert catchment, the ability of the catchment, and the GRAP \nparticularly, to support an irrigated agriculture (cotton) industry is imperative to evaluate, alongside MAR \nfeasibility. It has been suggested that farming practices from southern Australia cannot be simply \ntransferred to the north (Yeates et al., 2014), but instead new practices must be developed. Genetically \nmodified (GM) cotton has been previously grown in the Gilbert catchment (Petheram et al., 2013). Moving \nforward, developing shorter season cotton varieties should be a priority in the north (Matz, 2020). \nBased on past analysis on the feasibility of irrigated cotton production in Australia’s tropical north (Yeates \net al., 2014), the Gilbert catchment spans the areas likely to support dry-season and wet-season cotton \nproduction (Figure 14). The differences between dry-season and wet season cropping in the north is \ndetailed in Table 4. \n \nFigure 14 Likely boundary between dry-season (north of black line) and wet-season (south of dashed line) cotton production areas with the \nproduction season unknown between the lines. The Gilbert catchment is circled (Source: Yeates et al., 2014).  \n                                                       \n14 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/development/economic-development/gilbert-river-agricultural-scheme, accessed 15th \nAugust 2020 \n15 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/downloads/file/199/lether-1pdf, accessed 8th December 2020 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n16 \nTable 4 Comparison of dry-season and wet-season cotton production in the north.

This is due to the combinations of low soil water storage being \ncommon and highly variable rainfall (Petheram et al., 2013). The ability to predict a favourable season can \nbe done with a high degree of confidence at time of sowing (Petheram et al., 2013), encouraging \nopportunistic dryland cropping when conditions permit.   \nRotational cropping systems have also been proposed for the Gilbert catchment (Petheram et al., 2013, \nAsh et al., 2017), however managing such a system adds complexity where crop stages must be matched \nwith seasonal conditions (Ash et al., 2017). For example, times of low soil trafficability due to waterlogging \nwould limit when machinery can be used (Ash et al., 2017). Suggested crop rotation for cotton in the north \ninclude lablab, mungbean, peanuts and sorghum (Petheram et al., 2013).   \nThere have been multiple barriers to expanding agriculture in north Australia, including: \n• High transport costs to reach processing facilities or markets (Ash et al., 2017, Ash and Watson, \n2018, Matz, 2020) \n• Accessing land and water resource (Ash and Watson, 2018) \n• Obtaining the required approvals (Ash and Watson, 2018) \n• Sourcing capital costs required to establish a greenfields agriculture area (Ash and Watson, 2018)   \n• Gaining support from the local community (Ash and Watson, 2018) \n \nDue to the large rainfall events experienced in the north, erosion is possible, especially in poorly managed \nsystems (Petheram et al., 2013). Practices including minimum or zero tillage (as opposed to intensive \ntillage) and stubble retention have been suggested at a method of erosion control, where the aim is to \nmaintain natural suspended sediment loads (Petheram et al., 2013). However, rainfall in the North \ncommonly occurs before the late crop development phase, which minimises the likelihood of late rainfall \ndowngrading the cotton fibre quality and therefore price (Petheram et al., 2013).   \n \n3.4 Case study area of interest \nThe area of interest for this case study is the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP; Figure 15) which \ncorresponds to the area that the proposed Greenhills Dam would service. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n17 \n \nFigure 15 The Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (Source: https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-149777813/view, accessed 16 June 2020)  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n18 \n4. Scenarios \nThe proposed scenarios were initially drafted in late 2020 from preliminary feasibility analyses pertaining \nto MAR in the Gilbert River catchment and were refined based on discussions with local stakeholders and \nfurther assessment of potential feasibility. Note that these scenarios do not constitute an endorsement for \na particular course of action. Rather, they highlight possible opportunities for MAR in the Gilbert River \ncatchment, contrasting scenarios without a MAR component, and a scenario with both MAR and surface \nwater elements (conjunctive water management). They were used to guide the finalisation of the potential \nfeasibility assessment for the Gilbert case study (Section 5) and to develop recommendations for CRDC and \nother stakeholders to support any efforts to proceed with MAR, and conjunctive use of water more \nbroadly, should they wish to invest further in investigating MAR (Section 7.2).  \nCurrently, the cropping that does occur in the Gilbert River catchment tends to be irrigated using water \ndrawn from the aquifers in the sand beds of the Gilbert River 16. Some farms currently irrigating (for \ncropping trials or forage) pump into a tank on the river to build up head, filling the tank either during the \nday (or night) and running the pivot in the night (or day); other farms are able to pump straight from the \nbed sands into their irrigation systems 17. Given that the typically low yields of underlying sandstone \naquifers will constrain MAR in these systems 18, the most promising prospect appears to be MAR \ninterventions designed to provide timely and reliable water yields from the bed sands. These interventions \nwould aim to top up the bed sands and/or slow the drainage from the sands.  \nThe coarse scale of data on the alluvium in the Gilbert River catchment \n19 means that further data \ncollection and ongoing monitoring would be required to assess the full potential for MAR and gain \nconfidence that risks can be addressed within developed governance arrangements in a socially acceptable \nmanner. Focus is therefore on active management of bed sands, that is aiming to build understanding of \nthe system through incremental development under the current framework for water management in the \ncatchment, with a view to building evidence to support the state government to revise or refine rules \ncurrently limiting extraction, recharge, and infrastructure development. \nAssociated with all scenarios is the development of renewable energy infrastructure which, for regional \nscale development could open up the possibility of co-investment as well as benefits to electricity for the \nwhole region. All scenarios would need to seek approvals for, and address environment impacts, of \nvegetation clearing and to avoid deleterious impacts on culturally significant sites.  \n \n4.1 Farm scale MAR \nThis scenario focuses on active management of the bed sands through the capture and banking of water \nlicences during wet periods by individual farms, run by an individual owner or land manager. The intention \nwould be to use the bed sands to provide supplementary irrigation at the start of the dry season and use \nrecharge structures to maximise water levels at the end of the wet season using entitlements managed \nunder the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007. \nLandholders in the Gilbert catchment collectively hold 40 GL of water licences although little of this water \nis currently used for irrigated agriculture 20 (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020)(Jacobs Australia Pty \nLimited., 2020)(Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020)(Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020)(Jacobs Australia \nPty Limited., 2020).

Purchasers of entitlements commit to installing infrastructure capable of taking at least \n50% of the yearly entitlement within three years of issue 22. Given the monsoonal climate, there is ample \nwater available in most years, but dry season storage is the key challenge that bed sands could help \naddress. \nThe existing use of spear bores for domestic and irrigation purposes by landholders in the Gilbert \ndemonstrates that the infrastructure needed for extracting water from the bed sands works 23. As there is \nlimited established water delivery infrastructure, farmer managers would locate MAR operations adjacent \nto agriculturally suitable soils in order to reduce initial capital costs. On-farm strategies and infrastructure \nto recharge water into the bed sands could include regenerative agriculture techniques such as leaky weirs \nwhich could be constructed across small streams off the Gilbert River and would slow water flow and \nfacilitate local wetting of the landscape and alluvial sands 24. Construction materials and earthworks would \nbe needed for the construction of leaky weirs. Infiltration basins aim to recharge unconfined aquifers \nthrough pumping or diverting water from river into an off-stream storage. In the Gilbert, possible locations \nare the bed sand deposits that extend beyond the river channel. The requirements of infiltration basins are \nfor land adjacent to the river with permeable soils that facilitate quick recharge of water, the ability to fill \nthe basin by gravity, and the cost of earthworks. Methods taking place in the river will be costlier due to \nannual maintenance costs and higher regulation requirements.  \nWithin an active management paradigm, the aim is for land managers to progressively improve their water \nuse strategies and management of the bed sands over time, rather than aiming for a single major recharge \ninfrastructure investment. The starting point is to keep records of water use and state of the water \nresource (e.g. spear bore water levels), and to seek to collaborate with other landholders and \norganisations to gain a more complete understanding of the system and identify and evaluate possible \nimprovements. If the land manager has an existing spear bore entitlement, they could use these initially \n(and expand over time as needed) and implement measures to manage risks as part of their existing \noperations as they arise.   \nIn setting entitlement volumes, the Gulf Water (2007) Plan has considered environmental flows, avoiding \nimpacts on water holes, and maintaining riparian and in-stream vegetation. Restrictions on extraction \nprevent new licenses from taking water during dry season low flows, and there is no established procedure \ntailored to approvals of recharge infrastructure specifically. Changes to the Gulf Water (2007) Plan would \ntherefore be required in the 2027 review, and landholders would need to engage with state government \nearly to start exploring options for changing the plan to adopt condition-based management, emphasizing \navoidance of impacts to allow more flexibility in extraction. Collaboration between local stakeholders and \ngovernment would work towards establishing appropriate rules for recharge and later extraction of surface \nwater into bed sands, approvals for the establishment or replacement of infrastructure 25,26, and \nmonitoring of impacts. Any localised impacts of pumping from the riverbeds in the dry season would be \ntracked by monitoring water levels and yields from sand beds, streamflow, and vegetation condition.  It is \nanticipated that monitoring would need to extend to the full width of the bed-sands and at least a \n                                                       \n21 See Section 5.2.2 and https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-\nplanning/unallocated-water/gulf, accessed 18 June 2021  \n22 See Section 5.2.2 \n23 See Section 5.3.6  \n24 See Section 5.3.5  \n25 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/bores-and-groundwater/construction-approvals; \nhttps://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/farms-fishing-forestry/agriculture/rural-disaster-recovery/repairs-watercourses-\ninfrastructure/groundwater-bores-spears  \n26 In-stream infrastructure may need approval under the water act and water plan as well as other legislation (e.g. fishway \nbarrier works approval).  \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n20 \nkilometre upstream and downstream27, such that collaboration and establishment of information sharing \narrangements is important even with a farm scale focus. \n \n4.2 Farm scale surface water storage \nAn alternative to farm-scale MAR is investment in off-stream surface water storages (e.g. gully dams or ring \ntanks) on a single farm that the land manager could use to capture water during the wet season to provide \nsupplementary irrigation when needed at the start of the dry season. The source of water and \nrequirements for installation of infrastructure (50% capacity within three years) are as outlined in the farm \nscale MAR scenario, although under the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 there is also the ability to take overland \nflow in surface storages up to 250 ML without a water licence and larger volumes with a water licence \n28,29.  \nConstruction of off-stream storages is an established technology with defined institutional and compliance \nprocedures. However, as they retain water above ground, the highly seasonal climate of the Gilbert \ncatchment could lead to substantial evaporation losses. Also, the soils adjacent to the Gilbert River are \nhighly permeable and typically considered to be less suitable for off-stream storages 30, especially if they \nare not lined to prevent leakage. While leakage may recharge the bed sands in some circumstances, \nleakage and evaporative losses from off-stream storages have been estimated to add an additional cost of \n$140/ML to $240/ML to store water for 4 to 12 months, respectively 31. Land and operational factors \ndetermine the physical storage dimensions and storage capacity. \nSurface storages may still present the best option in circumstances where costs can be minimised or losses \nmay not be significant 32. Costs can be minimised in locations with pockets of low infiltration soils located \nclose to good agricultural land, or where sites that act as natural surface storages could be enhanced. \nLosses may not be significant for high value uses of smaller volumes of water such as bridging of water \nsupply between rainfall events and finishing a wet-season crop. Based on discussions with stakeholders in \nthe area the development of on-farm small scale surface storages was of greater interest than what could \nbe gauged from previous reports 33. Stakeholders also had themselves scoped areas that they felt were \nmost suitable for surface storages on their properties 34. \nWithout changes in policy to allow MAR, the need for associated infrastructure to accompany new \nentitlements suggests that off-stream surface water storages are being promoted by previous water \nreleases. This focus on surface flows for use is further complemented by the Water Plan’s ecological \noutcome of limiting dry season low flow extraction from the bed sands in the Gilbert River \n35, highlighting \nthat expanding groundwater use in aquifers outside the GABORA is currently not an option in the \ncatchment. In the Gilbert catchment, there has been little analysis of systems implications of widespread \nnew surface water storages, e.g. for low flows, such that environmental and subsequent regulatory risk \nmay remain an issue when investing in off-stream surface water storages 36. \n                                                       \n27 Section 6.3.2 \n28 See Section 5.7.1 \n29 Any off-stream works that take overland flow water need to be assessed for consistency with either an entitlement or water \nplan authority for taking overland flow water using limited capacity works \nhttps://www.rdmw.qld.gov.au/?a=109113:policy_registry/code-self-assessable-development-limited-capacity-works.pdf, \naccessed 3 December 2021. \n30 See Figure 39 \n31 See Section 5.4.2 \n32 See Section 5.4.2 \n33 See Section 5.1.2 \n34 See Section 5.1.2 \n35 See Section 5.7.1 \n36 Although not with a MAR component, some proponents have investigated options for accessing shallow (alluvial or other \nunconsolidated sediments) groundwater, along with other sources of water (namely overland flow), in other catchments \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n21 \nFurther investigation of off-stream water storages as an alternative to MAR is outside the scope of this \nproject but it appears that both may be viable in different locations or for different farms. Therefore, both \nshould be considered when taking a systems view of dry season water storage in the Gilbert.  \n \n4.3 Regional scale MAR and establishment of a local gin \nThis scenario describes a regional scale MAR scheme that could provide sufficient water to irrigate an area \nof cotton that would support a viable cotton gin servicing the Gilbert and adjacent catchments. A gin in the \nregion has been shown to be critical for profitability of local cotton production 37 but existing new cotton \nplanting outside the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP), namely in St Ronans, Mount Garnet, and \nInnot Hot Springs, means that substantial reductions in current transport costs may be achieved even if the \ngin is not located in Georgetown, and the Gilbert River would therefore not need to be the sole water \nsource. A recent estimate of the land area and yields needed to support a cotton gin are a minimum of \n7,000 hectares of cotton yielding 9 bales per hectare (i.e., ~67,500 bales) 38; other estimates of the number \nof bales needed to support a local gin have ranged from about 50,000 to 100,000. Irrigation is needed to \nmaximise cotton yields in the Gilbert with estimates that full irrigation (with a median irrigation \nrequirement of 3.2 ML/ha) would double yields 39. A report focused on feasible cotton gin locations in \nNorth Queensland is currently being prepared on behalf of the Mount Isa to Townsville Economic \nDevelopment Zone (MITEZ) 40.  \nMultiple strategies could be implemented within a regional-scale MAR scheme, with the Burdekin MAR \nscheme providing examples of the range of possible interventions 41. Recharge weirs could be \nincrementally constructed along the length of the water courses adjacent to the Gilbert River and the \nGRAP to detain water and increase the time for it to infiltrate into the riverbed sands. Similarly, infiltration \nbasins could be utilised to provide recharge for later extraction by multiple users. Structures such as \nunderground, sand dams and recharge weirs have been used internationally (e.g., Africa) in ephemeral \nsystems to retain flood flows in alluvium to provide regional scale water supply. Pooling behind the \nstructure could lead to the desired impact of longer recharge periods for the alluvial aquifer, but wet \nseason flows and discharge into the Gulf might be reduced, and sediment retention in the system \nincreased as water flows are slowed by structures. Such impacts can be tracked by monitoring levels and \nyields from sand beds, sediment loads before and after installation of weir(s), and changes in streamflow \njust downstream of the weir(s) and near the Gulf. Currently there are two groundwater monitoring bores \nin the catchment, one in the GRAP \n42. However, the monitoring bore is located in the GAB sandstone \n                                                       \nmanaged under the Gulf water plan. An example is the 15 Mile Irrigated Agricultural Development project. The Coordinator-\nGeneral’s evaluation on the impact assessment report provides an example of the processes and approvals required for a \nregional scheme. http://eisdocs.dsdip.qld.gov.au/15%20Mile%20Irrigated%20Agricultural%20Development/CGER/15-mile-\nirrigated-agricultural-development-coordinator-generals-evaluation-report.pdf, accessed 6 December 2021 \n37 See Section 5.4.1  \n38 Matz, J. 2020.

There are several bores in the area, most of which are used \nfor stock and domestic water supply 43 and are located in the GAB aquifers 44. \nThe operation, maintenance and monitoring of MAR schemes could be achieved through the \nestablishment of a local water management organisation that would partner with other agencies but \nultimately operate on a user pays cost recovery basis based on assessable area charges from the \nagriculture industry 45. Lessons can be learnt from the governance arrangements for the Burdekin system \nwhereby the water boards have responsibilities for day-to-day operation of the scheme and setting a \nbroad strategic framework, business targets and operational controls, with the state government providing \nthe policy framework and technical support 46.  \nThrough partnerships such an organisation could be set up to have an incremental mandate, starting with \nlocal data collection, knowledge management and sharing, moving on to daily support of landholder water \nmanagement, and then to development and operation of larger schemes. Given the coarseness of data on \nthe alluvium in the Gilbert, initial steps would require investment in studies to improve understanding of \nthe aquifer storage capacity of the alluvial sands and to build knowledge and capacity in the region for \nmanaging water in the bed sands. Understanding of the use of water in the river and bed sands over time \ncould allow local and state governments to play a more active role in assisting landholders to plan and \ncoordinate their pumping from bed sands, and address risks associated with pumping riverbeds dry during \ndry season and recharging during high flows. An element of this would be a network of monitoring bores \nused to track water depths in the bed sands during and after periods of recharge and extraction. A water \nmanagement organisation and its partners would play a critical role in working with state government to \nco-create appropriate rules for recharge and later extraction of surface water into bed sands, approvals for \nthe establishment or replacement of infrastructure 47, and monitoring of local and regional impacts. \nSubstantial changes are required in the 2027 review given that current unallocated water entitlements up \nfor tender in the Gilbert catchment are associated with flow conditions 48, and therefore cannot be used in \nthe way that current bed sand entitlements are used (i.e., extraction approved when there are low or no \nflows of the Gilbert River). An organised, coordinated, regional perspective provides a critical mass that \nwould facilitate and accelerate discussion around these changes. \n \n4.4 Surface water management and establishment of a local gin \nThis scenario describes the proposed Gilbert River Irrigation Project (GRIP) for which a Detailed Business \nCase (DBC) was prepared in 2020 49. The development would see a 323,577 ML dam constructed near \nGeorgetown on the Gilbert River that would be able to deliver 130 GL of water entitlements per year for \nuse as irrigation to an area of 17,900 ha on the fertile soils along the Gilbert River (Jacobs Australia Pty \nLimited., 2020). In this scenario the GRIP is associated with the development of a cotton gin to support the \nviability of an irrigated agriculture industry in the Gilbert (as per the Regional MAR scenario). In the DBC it \nwas suggested that the GRIP development would be of a size to support the establishment of a local cotton \ngin. \n                                                       \n43 See Figure 20 \n44 See Figure 75 \n45 In the Burdekin Delta, partnerships between the growers and millers of sugar exists such that growers pay two-thirds of the \ncharges and millers one-third. A similar arrangement could exist between cotton growers and the operators of a local gin. \n46 This scheme has the benefit of providing rate payers access to water for irrigation but one of the main purposes of the board \nis to replenish groundwater to levels preventing ingress of salt water.  \n47 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/bores-and-groundwater/construction-approvals; \nhttps://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/farms-fishing-forestry/agriculture/rural-disaster-recovery/repairs-watercourses-\ninfrastructure/groundwater-bores-spears  \n48 See Section 5.2.2 \n49 Jacobs Australia Pty Limited. 2020. Gilbert River Irrigation Project Detailed Business Case. Australia. \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n23 \nThe surface water infrastructure for the proposed GRIP encompasses the dam wall, pipelines, ring tanks \nand fully lined channels to avoid seepage losses. The DBC consider three scenarios for funding the GRIP: \nno, medium and high government funding. Under these scenarios, total customer charges of these \nscenario range from 54.50 and 77.78 $/ML for medium and high priority water, respectively, with high \ngovernment contributions, to 272.42 $/ML and 404.66 $/ML with no funding provided by government. \nThe maintenance of environmental flows is a requirement of the Gulf Water Plan, so for example, the \nproposed Gilbert River Irrigation Project dam would need to be able to release up to 136,830 ML per day \nto meet the Gulf Water Plan’s environmental flow objectives \n50. Impacts on bed sands would likely need to \nbe assessed as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment prior to approval of the dam, which would \nlikely still require further investment in bed sands monitoring. The dam volume is potentially on the order \nof 10 times larger than the bed sands storage volume51, and therefore involves larger investment in \nagricultural development that would be transformational for the region. In contrast to the more \nincremental approach of regional scale MAR, attracting this investment and managing this transformation \nis therefore critical, including investment in urban infrastructure. State significant listing of the project was \nalso considered important in the DBC, in particular to gain exemptions needed to clear vegetation 52. \nGiven political support and investor interest, policy considerations surrounding a dam would perhaps be \nmore straightforward then implementing MAR due to the long history of in-stream surface water storages \nthroughout Queensland and Australia. However, dam construction would likely need to satisfy policy \nbeyond the water sphere, for example, the Queensland Fisheries Act on account of a structure being \nerected in a waterway. Details about additional policy related to water development can be found in \nSection 5.7.3.  \n \n4.5 Conjunctive water management and establishment of a local gin \nThis scenario describes a regional scale irrigation scheme that combines MAR and the proposed GRIP \nscheme, again with establishment of a local gin. \nMAR might be used in conjunction with the proposed GRIP dam in two ways. The dam could be used as a \ntemporary storage or sedimentation tank prior to releasing water to recharge the alluvial river sands. \nAlternately, the dam could be used to deliver immediate water demands from entitlements with the \nexcess used to recharge bed sands using MAR, which can then be extracted when required in the dry \nseason or in years of low rainfall. As the intent is to recharge the bed sands, the dam wall would be \nretained in this scenario but not necessarily the pipelines, ring tanks and channels. Avoiding concreting \nchannels could save costs, increase recharge, and retain control over gravity-fed delivery. Delivering water \nsolely by releases to the bed sands would reduce capital costs but increase pumping costs and changes to \ninstream flow patterns. Combining the strategies may also reduce initial investment by allowing for a \nsmaller initial dam wall and later expansion, though costing of this approach was out of scope of this \nproject. \nAs the dam would hold back (flood) water during wet season there will be some impacts of reduced wet \nseasons flows and discharge into the Gulf and the inundation of an area upstream of dam would have \nimpacts on native vegetation. Any potential impacts of pumping the sand beds in the dry season would \nneed to be tracked. The states to be monitored, and the information and infrastructure needed to do so, to \nidentify unacceptable impacts from the dam, recharge releases and riverbed pumping are as for the \nRegional MAR and dam scenarios. Once again, the Burdekin scheme could be looked at to provide \n                                                       \n50 Jacobs Australia Pty Limited. 2020.

Similar to \nany regional scale scenario, many policy approvals outside the water sphere would be required 54.  Despite \ntheir potential complexity relative to narrower or more familiar developments, hybrid solutions of this type \nare worth including in any systems analysis of dry season water storage in the Gilbert given the flexibility \nand adaptive capacity they provide, and therefore the opportunity to approach sustainable irrigation \ndevelopment as an incremental rather than potentially disruptive step-change transformation. \n \n                                                       \n53 See Section 5.7.4 \n54 See Section 5.7.3 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n25 \n5. Feasibility Criteria Analysis \nThis section presents the data, information, analysis and assumptions that have been made in order to \ninform the potential feasibility of the five scenarios presented in Section 4 across the seven criteria \noutlined in Table 5. An overview of key points for each scenario and feasibility criteria is given in Table 6. \n \nTable 5 The seven feasibility criteria of Ticehurst and Curtis (2017). \nCriteria Example questions and considerations \nDemand for Water • Is there demand for more water, or a greater water security? \n• Who wants the water and when? \nWater availability • Is water available to be banked underground (e.g. unused surface water shares, surface water \ntraded in when prices are low)? \nTechnical \nfeasibility \n• Is there space in the aquifer systems to store surface water for drier times? \n• How can the water be recharged, stored and extracted? \nFinancial viability • Financial viability and profitability of MAR schemes are influenced by many factors including the \nMAR type, water source, infiltration and recovery rates, groundwater depth, water markets, crop \nprices and yields, groundwater pumping costs  \nEnvironmental \nrisks \n• Are there any significant effects on water quality & quantity (positive or negative)? \n• What are the consequential impacts of any change on farm land and ecosystems? \nSocial acceptability • Is it a socially acceptable option to irrigators, stakeholders and the wider community? \n• What are people's values, knowledge and beliefs about MAR? \n•  Do they perceive risks about its implementation in their region? \nGovernance \narrangement \n• Are the legislative and policy settings appropriate to support a MAR system?  \n• If not, how would they need to be changed?  \n \n5.1 Effective demand for products \nTo catalyse innovative water management there must be ‘demand’ for change. In the Gilbert catchment, \ndemand for change could include calls for: \n• increasing the volume of water available for irrigation, especially to allow for industry development, \nand/or \n• evening out water availability between the wet and dry season, to create greater year-round water \nsecurity.  \nTo assess if there is demand for such changes in the Gilbert catchment, first the seasonal variability in \nwater availability is explored (Section 5.1.1), followed by findings and feedback for the demand for change \nto water management from an irrigators perspective (Section 5.1.2) and community/industry perspective \n(Section 5.1.3). \n \n Variability of water availability  \nThe seemingly abundant water supply in Northern Australia has sparked development interest in the area \n(Petheram et al., 2010). This notion overlooks the areas ‘unfavourable streamflow characteristics, storage \nconstraints and large evaporative losses’  and that seasonality is a limiting factor to development (Lennon \net al., 2014).   \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n26 \nTable 6 Summary of the scenario feasibility \nScenario Farm scale MAR Farm scale surface water storage Regional scale MAR Regional scale surface water \nstorage  \nRegional scale MAR + surface water \nstorage  \nEffective \ndemand for \nproducts [5.1] \nThere is some interest from farmers to diversify from traditional pastoralism \nonly enterprises [p96]. Some farmers have already started cropping, either \ndryland or irrigated using water entitlements [5.1.2].  \nBeyond interest from farmers in the region [5.1.2], there is also support for expansion of irrigated \nagriculture from the Etheridge Shire [5.1.3]. Demand for water also exists from actors from southern \nfarming regions expanding to the north [5.1.3].    \nWater \navailability \n[5.2] \nThere are currently unallocated water entitlements out for tender [5.2.2]. \nThese entitlements are associated with flow conditions.  \nThere are substantial volumes of unallocated general reserve water beyond those currently out for tender \nthat could be used for regional scale projects [5.2.3]. \nTechnical \nfeasibility \n[5.3] \nSurface storage: Many past reports describe the region as unsuitable for surface storage due to the \nhighly permeable soils and high evaporative demands [5.3.2, 5.4.2], however there are possibly situations \nwhere these impediments can be navigated. \n \nMAR: Recharge of bed sands occurs naturally [5.3.1]. The ability to complement this is unknown and \nwould need to be explored through active management and monitoring of the bed sands [5.3.4]. Many \nmodes of MAR have been suggested to target alluvial aquifers elsewhere [5.3.4, 5.3.5]. \nCSIRO’s Flinders and Gilbert \nAgricultural Resource Assessment \nidentified several possible dam \nsites over both the catchments, \nincluding the Greenhills Dam on \nthe Gilbert River. This is the upper \nbound of both the proposed \nGilbert River Agricultural Precinct \n[5.1.2] and the area of interest of \nthis feasibility assessment [3.3]. \nA recharge release scheme [5.3.5], where \nwater is purposefully released from an \nupstream dam to recharge the Gilbert \nRiver bed sands could top up the bed \nsands throughout the dry season. This \nMAR method was suggested for the \nMitchell catchment [5.3.4]. \nFinancial \nviability [5.4] \nSurface storage: Due to losses, water costs increase substantially with increasing storage time [5.4.2].  \n \nMAR: Initial estimates of the costings of potential MAR schemes in North Queensland are available, with \nlevelized costs ranging from $48 - $172 per ML [5.3.4]. The only operating MAR scheme in Queensland (in \nthe Burdekin) has a levelized costs in the lower half of those estimated above ($80/ML) [5.4.4].   \nA detailed business case exists for \na large in-stream surface storage \nin the Gilbert River [5.4.3]. \nEstimated water costs range from \n$54.50 - $404.66 per ML \ndepending on priority (high, \nmedium) and funding sources \n[5.4.3]. \nThe cost of establishing all the required \ninfrastructure for a recharge release \nscheme (i.e., dam and MAR \ninfrastructure) is unknown as past \nassessments assumed that the dam was \nalready constructed [\n5.3.4]. However, \nusing the river as a natural delivery \nnetwork would reduce costs if a \npipeline/lined channel delivery network \nwas to be built [5.4.3]. \n  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n27 \nScenario Farm scale MAR Farm scale surface water storage Regional scale MAR Regional scale surface water storage  Regional scale MAR + surface \nwater storage  \nEnvironmental \nrisk [5.5] \nSurface storage: Systems implications of multiple off-stream water storages, e.g. for low flows, may pose \nan environmental risk \n \nMAR: Active management of extractions, with condition-based regulations, is needed to ensure outflows \ninto the Gulf are not adversely reduced [5.5.3], and to build knowledge about hyporheic ecosystems and \nany impacts of extraction from the bed sands of the Gilbert River [p81]. \n \nThere are many environmental assets \n[5.5.1] and processes [5.5.2] that rely on \nthe substantial wet season flows. \nMultiple methods have been suggested \nto minimise the impact of water \ndevelopment on the environment \n[5.5.3], including allowing first flush \nevents to proceed unimpeded.  \n  \nThe combined use of MAR and an \ninstream dam could pose risks to \nthe hyporheic ecosystem of the \nbed sands [p81] and wetland and \nfloodplain processes [5.5.2]. \nSocial \nacceptability \n[5.6] \nAll options provide substantial changes to the status quo. A large dam represents a potentially disruptive, transformational change for the whole community. Even though MAR and surface \nwater storage options are more incremental [5.3.5], they are also highly uncertain and require development of high-level trust and coordination. Given that changes are possible at the \nearliest with the review of the Gulf Plan in 2027, bringing the community along for the journey is critical, feasible, and already being pursued by the Etheridge Shire Council [5.1.3, p95]. \nGovernance \narrangements \n[5.7] \nChanges to existing policy, co-\ncreated with state government, \nwould be needed to allow for \nsustainable water extraction from \nthe bed sands and MAR during dry \nseason low-flow conditions [p98]. \n250 ML of overland flow can be taken \nwithout a licence [5.7.1], promoting \nsmall scale on-farm surface storage. \n \nBeyond water related policy, there are other legislative hurdles to establishing water infrastructure and \nirrigated agriculture in the region [5.7.3]. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n28 \nReflecting the extreme seasonality of the Gilbert catchment, where ~ 95% of rainfall and  ~ 99% of runoff \noccurs during the wet season (Lennon et al., 2014), Figure 16 illustrates that demand for water peaks \ntowards the end of the dry season (Lennon et al., 2014). In other words, demand and supply are inverse, \nwith storage required to bridge this gap (Lennon et al., 2014). If a substantial year-round irrigation industry \nwas to develop in the region, it would follow that future water demand would also be larger than what is \ncurrently seen.  \n \nFigure 16 Supply vs. Demand for water in Northern Australia  (Source: Lennon et al., 2014)  \n \n Irrigators demand for water \nAgriculture in the Gilbert catchment is dominated by pastoralism with only small areas of cropping \n(Petheram et al., 2013, Álvarez-Romero, 2015). There has been interest from some farmers in the region to \nincorporate irrigated agriculture into their enterprise, which has been accompanied by called for water \ninfrastructure in the catchment. For example, in 2017 a farmer in Georgetown planted sorghum and corn \nto assess the suitability of cropping on their land and diversification 55. After a successful harvest, this \nfarmer called for support to establish a large-scale irrigation project to get the critical mass onboard, \npossibly unlocking economic gains not yet realised on the region. The farmer suggested that the major \nbarrier to this was a lack of water licences. However, based on the Gulf unallocated water release, there \nare water licences available, albeit with associated flow conditions (See Section 5.2). \nNeither water development in the Gilbert River or shifting to a regulatory system of active water \nmanagement is a priority of the state government. The Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP) lies to the \nwest of Georgetown in a monsoonal climate where substantial volumes of water are typically available in \nthe wet, yet storage is required to access water in the dry. The region has struggled to attract investment \nin the proposed Green Hills dam, and water releases have seen low sales. At face value this appears to \nindicate low interest for water development and therefore low need for additional investment. However, \nanecdotal evidence at the Gilbert River Agricultural Forum (April 2021) suggests that there is instead a \nlatent demand for water and water storage, hidden behind water-related and other barriers, information \ngaps regarding system operation, management options and pathways for investment \n56 (see page 96).  \nIn conversations with landholders and other stakeholders at the Gilbert River Agricultural Forum in April \n2021, there was some interest in on-farm surface water storages. Based on reports, the feasibility of such \ninfrastructure in the region generally is low (see Section 5.4.2), although some landholders indicated that \n                                                       \n55 https://www.northqueenslandregister.com.au/story/4647549/gilbert-irrigators-seek-water/, accessed 22nd June 2020. \n56 From this Gilbert case study, the Queensland Water Modelling Network (QWMN) has funded a project led by ANU in \ncollaboration with Gulf Savannah Natural Resource Management (GSNRM) which aims in part to assess the extent of latent \nwater and water storage demand in the Gilbert.   \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n29 \nregions of their property would be suitable for turkey nest dams or structures that use the natural \ncontours of the land. They said they could use such storages to ‘finish off’ current or hypothetical crops at \nthe end of the wet season. This water management timeline would minimise evaporative losses by not \nholding water long post wet season. Other persons at the forum expressed interest in having some \nflexibility in planting times at the start of the wet season. By having water stored, the planting could still \noccur in a late onset wet season or in a wet season with a large gap between rainfall events. These \nconversations support those from a farmer interview conducted in March 2019 when scoping the potential \nCRDC MAR project case studies. He noted that whilst their bed sand licenses allowed them access to a lot \nof water early in the season, it peters out into the dry season when they need the water to finish off their \ncotton crops. There are five spear bores with entitlements where water is actively being extracted from the \nbed sands (see Section 5.2.1); from speaking with three landholders or land managers the reliability of \naccess to water over time from the bed sands varies between the bores (even over quite small distances \nbetween bores).  \nIn summary, there is demonstrable demand from irrigator landholders to even out water availability in the \nlead-up and to and end of the wet season where water security is not guaranteed from year to year. The \nneed for more water volumes is not as clear-cut given storage limitations and other barriers may be \nconstraining demand.   \n \n Industry and community perspective \nIndustries usually associated with the southern Australian farming regions (e.g., MDB), including the cotton \nindustry, are looking to boost irrigated agriculture in the Gilbert River region, with water entitlements and \ninfrastructure being highlighted as major requirements to support this development 57. There is interest \nfrom players in the horticultural industry to establish trials or plantings in the region 58. For example, one \ntable grape producer is conducting a trial in the Gilbert catchment with a vision to be the first to achieve \nyear-wide production across their Australian holdings   \nThe Etheridge Shire Council, one of the local councils in the Gilbert catchment, has long supported the \nexpansion of the limited irrigation infrastructure in the area 59,60. A detailed business case (DBC) was \nrecently released in support of a large dam on the Gilbert River (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). The \ncurrent council remains supportive of irrigation to support diversification and value-adding to existing \ngrazing, horticulture and cropping in the catchment. They are deliberately taking a broader look at water \nmanagement and agriculture in the catchment, rather than the previous focus on the proposed dam, to \nensure they had landholder support to grow the precinct sustainably 61. Local participants at the Gilbert \nRiver Agricultural Forum, expressed the desire that future agricultural development would retain the \ncharacter of the catchment and support local development and jobs. This suggests some tension with some \ncalls for broadscale agricultural development and retaining the pastoral identity of the catchment. \n   \n                                                       \n57 https://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/story/4891553/cotton-backs-nq-water-announcement/, accessed 24 June 2020 \n58 https://www.northqueenslandregister.com.au/story/7188113/gilbert-river-forum-to-step-cattlemen-through-ag-options/, \naccessed 17 May 2021 \n59 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/development/economic-development/gilbert-river-agricultural-scheme, accessed 24 June \n2020 \n60 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/downloads/file/599/gilbert-river-irrigation-project-brief, accessed 24 June 2020 \n61 https://www.northqueenslandregister.com.au/story/7188113/gilbert-river-forum-to-step-cattlemen-through-ag-options/, \naccessed 17 May 2021 \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n30 \n5.2 Water availability \nSurface water in the Gilbert catchment is managed and allocated based on the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 62 \noverseen by the Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water (RDWM), from here \nreferred to as the Plan. Groundwater in Great Artesian Basin aquifers in the Gilbert catchment are \nmanaged based on the Great Artesian Basin and other regional aquifers (GABORA) plan 63. Groundwater \nthat does not fall under the management of the GABORA is managed by the Plan [Water Plan (Gulf) 2007: \nSection 11 (2)].  \n \n Current Water Licences  \nSurface Water  \nTable 7 outlines the entitlements, both allocated and unallocated, in the Plan 64. The Plan includes the \nSettlement Creek, Nicholson, Leichardt, Morning Inlet, Flinders, Gilbert, Norman and Staaten catchments \n(Figure 17). As per Section 8 (1) of the Plan ‘Groundwater in an aquifer under a prescribed watercourse, or \nunder land within 1 km of a prescribed watercourse, is declared to be water in the watercourse’. The \nGilbert River, the river that runs through the GRAP for this research, is identified as a prescribed \nwatercourse [Section 8 (4)]. This indicates that water in the bed sands of the Gilbert River is classified as \nsurface water, rather than groundwater, and be allocated as such.  \nCurrent entitlements in the Gilbert River catchment, as reported in the Minister’s Performance Assessment \nReport (DNRME, 2018a), are outlined in Table 8. The metered usage for the 2016/17 water year is also \nincluded in Table 8 to highlight the gap between entitlements and usage. One of the entitlements in the \nGilbert catchment is the water licence granted to Etheridge Shire Council (ESC) from the strategic \nunallocated reserve (DNRME, 2018a). Additional to the entitlements 65 in Table 8, maximum annual \nvolumetric limits are set in specified areas of the catchment (Figure 18, Figure 19, Table 9). For these areas, \nthere are five entitlements actively extracting water from the bed sands (Zones 3, 4 & 5 in Figure 18 and \nFigure 19), with usage varying between 178 – 2894 ML/year between 2010 – 2017 (DNRME, 2018a).

The prevalence of stock and domestic bores throughout \nthe catchment would result in relatively small groundwater use volumes. This is confirmed by the work of \nKent et al.

Under the Gulf Water \nPlan there are currently unallocated entitlements aimed at individual properties that total 85 GL per year \n66. These entitlements were last updated 29 June 2020. Table 10 provides outlines the details of the \nentitlements and Figure 22 displays the zones of allocations. Figure 23 and Figure 24 show when flow \nconditions are met based on discharge data from the last three years.  \nThe release of these entitlements for individual properties is aimed at landholders either entering into or \nexpanding existing irrigation activity 67. It is hoped that this will support economic growth, business \ndiversification and sustainable agriculture in the region. It is envisaged that irrigated agriculture projects \nwill begin or expand soon after securing water. This is reflected in one of the license conditions which \nrequires infrastructure capable of taking at least 50% of the yearly entitlement to be installed within 3 \nyears of issue. The individual and total allocated volumes have been selected as a way to ensure rapid \nassessment of an application while reflecting demand and development needs. Also considered is the need \nto retain water for large scale water infrastructure proposals/developments.          \nThe available entitlements also consider any impacts on existing entitlements and the environment \n68,69. \nThe annual volumes and rate of take limits listed in Table 10 are intended to ensure that the reliability of \n                                                       \n66 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, \naccessed 15 August 2020  \n67 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, \naccessed 15 August 2020  \n68 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, \naccessed 15 August 2020 \n69 Other impacts of proposed development, such as those on cultural heritage sites and vegetation management constraints is \nconsidered when the entitlement application is assessed. \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n35 \nexisting entitlements are not compromised. The flow conditions outlined in Table 11 have been put in \nplace to ensure that ecosystems dependent on peak flows (e.g., waterholes, floodplains, estuaries) still \nreceive the flow they require. For example, in the lower section of the catchment (Zone 6 (0 km – 171 km \nAMTD) in Figure 22) water can only be extracted when flow is in excess of 15,100 ML per day (Table 10, \nFigure 23). On average, since 1967, such conditions have been met 15 days a year (Jacobs Australia Pty \nLimited., 2020). Two payment options are available for these farm scale entitlements (Table 11). \n \nTable 10 Release of unallocated water in the Gilbert Catchment (Source: \nhttps://www.rdmw.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1486600/gulf-water-release-terms.pdf, accessed 29 November 2021) \nLocation (see \nFigure 22) \nAnnual volume \navailable (ML/year) \nRate of take \n(ML/Day) \nWater source \noptions  \nVolumetric \nlimit  \nConditions (see Figure 23 \n& Figure 24) \nZone 6  \n0 km – 171 km \nAMTD \nUp to 75,000 5% of annual \nvolume \nWatercourse \nonly  \nWatercourse \nand overland \nflow combined  \nUp to 25,000 \nML per \nproperty  \nTaking water will be \npermitted when the flow \nin the Gilbert River at \nBurke Development Road \nexceeds 15,100 ML per \nday \nUnzoned  \nor Zone 6  \n171 km – 368 km \nAMTD \nUp to 10,000 10% of annual \nvolume  \nWatercourse \nonly  \nWatercourse \nand overland \nflow combined \nOverland flow \nonly \nUp to 2,000 \nML per \nproperty \nTaking water will be \npermitted when the flow \nin the Gilbert River at \nRockfields exceeds 2,592 \nML per day \n   \nTable 11 Cost of unallocated entitlements (Source: https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-\nplanning/unallocated-water/gulf) \nOption Cost  \nFull Value Amount $125.00 per ML upfront \nAnnual Installment Amount $13.00 per ML per annum for 10 years (includes prorated CPI and administration charges) \n \n Catchment Scale to Support Water Infrastructure \nAs part of the Gulf Water Plan, there is additional general unallocated water beyond the farm scale \nunallocated entitlements.

(2020) noted the potential for up to 200,000 ML of \nentitlements to be issued for the support of water infrastructure. \nIn line with the conditions outline above, the maintenance of environmental flows is a requirement of the \nGulf Water Plan, so any larger entitlements would be required to abide by the Plan. For example, the \nproposed Gilbert River Irrigation Project dam would need to be able to release up to 136,830 ML per day \nto meet the Gulf Water Plan’s environmental flow objectives (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). \nTable 12 Unallocated water available in the Gilbert Catchment based on the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 [reprinted in September 2017] \nUnallocated Water in the Gilbert Catchment Volume (ML) \nIndigenousa 17,500 \nState Purposeb 5,000 \nGeneralc 467,000 \na may be granted only for helping indigenous communities achieve their economic and social aspirations \nb may be granted to a coordinated project (see https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/coordinator-general/assessments-and-\napprovals/coordinated-projects), a project of regional significance (see Section 27 of Water Plan (Gulf) 2007) or town water supply  \nc may be granted for any purpose       \n \n                                                       \n70 https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/compare/2016-12-06/2017-09-02/sl-2007-0268, accessed 30 April 2020  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n36 \n \nFigure 22 Zones for unallocated water in the Gilbert catchment, as defined by the Gulf Water Plan (Source: \nhttps://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, accessed 23 April \n2021)  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n37 \n \n \nFigure 23 Discharge of Gilbert River at Burke Development Road, showing when flow condition for extraction are met (Extraction Limit) \n \nFigure 24 Discharge of Gilbert River at Rockfields, showing when flow condition for extraction are met (Extraction Limit) \n \n5.3 Technical feasibility \nThe seasonality and large evaporative losses highlighted in Section 5.1 raise the possibility that dams and \nother irrigation infrastructure may not be well suited and result in large losses (Lennon et al., 2014). \nAlternative water management techniques, including conjunctive surface and groundwater use and MAR, \nhave been suggested as possible methods to meet demand during the dry season (Lennon et al., 2014).    \nThis section is structured to provide information of aquifer and soil characteristics (Section 5.3.1 and \nSection 5.3.2) and then to inform the design, planning and implementation of MAR strategies (Sections \n0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\n250000\n300000\n350000\n400000\n11/1/16 5/20/17 12/6/17 6/24/18 1/10/19 7/29/19\nDischarge (ML)\nGilbert River at Burke Development Road\nDischarge\nExtracion\nLimit\n0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\n250000\n300000\n350000\n11/1/16 5/20/17 12/6/17 6/24/18 1/10/19 7/29/19\nDischarge (ML)\nGilbert River at Rockfields \nDischarge\nExtraction limit\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n38 \n5.3.3, 5.3.4, 5.3.5, 5.3.6, and 5.3.7). Conjunctive water management, which MAR can be part of, is \npotentially simpler in less developed agricultural areas compared to regions with already developed \nsurface water infrastructure (CSIRO, 2009). \nThe following subsections present information on both the catchment scale and the area encompassing \nthe GRAP.   \n \n How much water can be recharged or extracted? \nAquifer characteristics across the Gilbert catchment \nAlluvial Sediments: Unconsolidated alluvial sediments overlay the deeper groundwater system throughout \nthe Gilbert catchment, especially in current and old riverbeds (e.g. Gilbert River bed sands) (Petheram et \nal., 2013). It is possible for local groundwater systems to form in these sediments (Petheram et al., 2013). \nThe Gilbert River bed sands have been developed for local agriculture and therefore are the most \ncharacterised of the alluvial aquifers.   \nThe Gilbert River bed sands have an estimated total saturated volume of 17 – 20 GL and good water quality \n(Petheram et al., 2013, Department of Natural Resources, 1998). Other areas of alluvial sediments (e.g., \nEinasleigh Common) in the Gilbert catchment are associated with poor water quality and high salinity  \n(Petheram et al., 2013). \nGreat Artesian Basin (GAB): A portion of the Gilbert catchment is located within the Great Artesian Basin \n(GAB) groundwater system (Figure 25). The GAB sub-basin that part of the Gilbert River is located within is \nthe regional scale groundwater system known as the Carpentaria Basin (Petheram et al., 2013). The \nCarpentaria Basin is comprised of a series of aquifers and aquitards (sedimentary rock formations), \ncharacterised by large distances between recharge and discharge zones (hundreds of kilometers or more) \nand residence times of the order of centuries (Petheram et al., 2013). Aquifers and aquitards within the \nCarpentaria Basin include the Gilbert River Formation and Eulo Queen Group, overlain by the Rolling Down \nGroup (Figure 27, Figure 28) (Petheram et al., 2013). Many of the formation have direct connectivity, for \nexample, the Bulimba Formation exhibits connectivity to both the Normanton and Gilbert River Formations \n(Figure 28) (Radke and Ransley, 2020). Recharge occurs where these aquifers outcrop (Figure 29). Where \nno outcropping occurs, the recharge is estimated to be low (< 5 mm/year) (Petheram et al., 2013), \nhowever precise recharge volumes are unknown (Jolly et al., 2013). However, it has been suggested that \nthe bed sands are not connected to underlying aquifers (DNRME, 2006b, DNRME, 2018b).  \nYields from GAB formations are often too low to support irrigated agriculture (Figure 30). Vanderzalm et al. \n(2018) found similar yields from rock aquifers in the neighboring Mitchell catchment. There are two \nmonitoring bores in the GAB aquifers in the Gilbert catchment. Bore levels and rainfall are shown in Figure \n31 and Figure 32. \nOther Aquifers: In areas not included in the GAB, basalt aquifers associated with the Chudleigh and \nMcBride Provinces dominate (Figure 26). These are fractured rock formations with notable groundwater \nsupplies, that is likely to discharge into adjacent waterholes. \nUnderlying Aquifers: Based on the work of Radke and Ransley (2020), there is minimal connectivity \nbetween the GAB aquifers in the Gilbert catchment and the underlying basins (Figure 33). \nGroundwater Salinity: Groundwater salinity varies across the Gilbert catchment (Jolly et al., 2013, \nPetheram et al., 2013) (Figure 29). The central and southern part of the catchment, associated with Gilbert \nRiver alluvium and GAB recharge beds, display fresher groundwater, while the regolith and coastal aquifers \nare more saline. The Einasleigh Metamorphics and McBride basalt west of Einasleigh are also more saline \nthen elsewhere in the catchment. Due to the high permeability of the alluvial sediments adjacent to the \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n39 \nGilbert River, an increase in irrigation there would be unlikely to result in large water table rises and \nsalinity issues (Jolly et al., 2013). \n \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n40 \nFigure 25 The extent of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in the Gilbert catchment, with outcropping aquifer layers shown.

Aquifer \nmaterial in this reach is comprised of moderately to poorly sorted sand and gravel (Department of Natural \nResources, 1998), to depths ranging between 1 and 15 m (DNRME, 2006b). The (conservatively) estimated \nvolume of the aquifer is 67,909,000 m3 (Department of Natural Resources, 1998). Expected porosity is \nbetween 25 – 30% (Department of Natural Resources, 1998).

Based on particle size \ndistribution analysis, permeability of the aquifer is between 10 m/day (1000 mm/day) to 690 m/day \n(690000 mm/day) (Jolly et al., 2013), substantially greater than the above estimates. The lower \npermeability is due to underlying sediments that have increased clay content or are sandstone (DNRME, \n2006b). Characterisation of this bed sands would show if this lower permeability was widespread (i.e., a \nlayer resulting from sedimentation sequences) or localised. Based on a pumping test, vertical transmissivity \nwas 237 m2/day, horizontal transmissivity was 4743 m2/day and specific yield was 0.168 (Jolly et al., 2013). \n \n \nFigure 33 Inferred hydraulic connectivity across the base of the Great Artesian Basin (Source: Radke and Ransley, 2020) \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n45 \nThe primary recharge mechanisms for this aquifer are rainfall and streamflow (DNRME, 2006b). There is \nvery little connectivity between the underlying rock aquifers and the bed sands (DNRME, 2006b, DNRME, \n2018b). However, the contribution, if any, of old water sources to flows in the bed sands is not known with \ncertainty (DNRME, 2006a). To move forward with bed sand development (MAR or otherwise) it would be \nadvisable to further investigate whether changes to bed sand dynamics would have consequences for \nunderlying and surrounding aquifers. On a catchment scale, groundwater discharge constitutes a small \nproportion of overall streamflow (Petheram et al., 2013). \nThere are distinct geological features scattered throughout the bed sands (Department of Natural \nResources, 1998), for example, rock bars (DNRME, 2006b). These are presumed to act as physical barriers \nto groundwater flow through the bed sands, decreasing hydraulic connectivity (DNRME, 2006b), \nparticularly as the dry season progresses (Department of Natural Resources, 1998). This could cause the \nformation of discrete subsurface pools within the bed sands (Department of Natural Resources, 1998).   \nGroundwater from the bed sands is low salinity and otherwise of good quality (DNRME, 2006b).        \nAn exploratory drilling program in the area of interest, aiming to quantify the water resources in the \nGilbert River bed sands (Department of Natural Resources, 1998), focused on a region of the Gilbert \ndeemed to have potentially arable soils; the 59 km length of river between ‘Prestwood’ and ‘Chadshunt’ \nstations (Figure 34). This is roughly the area targeted by the proposed Gilbert River Irrigation Project \n(Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020) and, consequently, the focus area of the scenarios described in \nSection 4. Water is being drawn from the Gilbert River bed sands currently, using shallow interception \ngalleries, sand-spears and gravel-packed bore-holes. \nBore holes were drilled across the riverbed at multiple locations in the study area to determine the depth \nand composition of the bed material to assess its potential as a groundwater aquifer. The drilling occurred \nin the active river channel after surface flow ceased. Results are summarised by location in Table 13. It was \nestimated that the bed sands in this area contained between 16,980 ML to 20,370 ML of water \n(Department of Natural Resources, 1998). From this estimate it was recommended that water licences for \nirrigation should consider that the bed sands would store a volume of 18,000 ML when surface flow \nceases. This drilling survey did not extend very far from the riverbed, making these estimates conservative \nas the alluvial aquifer may extend onto the adjacent floodplain (Jolly et al., 2013).  \nIt is common for unconfined aquifers in North Queensland to fill to full capacity during the wet season and \ndrain in the dry season (Knapton et al., 2019). Specifics on this process in the Gilbert River bed sands is \nunknown. \n \n Soils \nSoils suitable for MAR \nSoil type can be a limiting factor when assessing the plausibility of infiltration-based MAR schemes. It is \ncommon for infiltration basins to be located on soils with sandy textures (Beganskas and Fisher, 2017, \nSmith and Pollock, 2012) to maximise permeability and take advantage of high infiltration rates (Rahman et \nal., 2012, Russo et al., 2015). This would facilitate the quick infiltration of recharge water. The quick \nrecharge of water is especially important in the Gilbert due to the seasonality of streamflow (i.e. source \nwater), where water availability is temporally limited.  \nMAR schemes that utilise injection are less dependent on soil type. The characteristics of the target aquifer \nare instead more important, and can be limiting (Yuan et al., 2016). Confined or semi-confined aquifers are \ngenerally more suitable for direct injection wells (Yuan et al., 2016), whereas unconfined aquifers are \ngenerally better suited to infiltration basins.      \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n46 \nIn the Gilbert catchment, where there is an absence of already established water delivery infrastructure, \nthere is added importance of operating a MAR scheme near agriculturally suitable soils in order to \nminimise capital costs. Therefore, it is important look for areas that could both support an expansion into \nirrigated agriculture and support an associated MAR scheme.   \n \nTable 13 Results of the Gilbert River Bed sand Investigation Exploratory Drilling Programme, as summarised from Department of Natural \nResources (1998). \nLocation  Description  Interpretation  \nPrestwood Low flow channel  \nTotal width of river bed ~325 m \nDepth of aquifer material below the normal water table \nlevel is minimal \nRiverview River has a broad, fairly uniform sandy bed with a \nnarrow low-flow channel \nGranite outcrops  \nTotal width of riverbed ~ 325 m Standing water \nlevel of about 2m below natural surface \n \nSand/gravel to 3.3 – 13.5 m, then clayed sand/gravel (to \nabout 15 m), then dense gravelly clay (15.3 – 22.5 m) \nBlancourt  River is fairly narrow low-flow channel about 100 \nm wide  \nFree water was evident at the lowest point of the \nriver bed \nDepth of clean sand/gravel from 4.5 m – 6 m, underlain \nby clayed sand/gravel, bottom out in dense cemented \nclayey gravel between 15 – 25 m  \nSaturated sand/gravel appears to extend beneath both \nriver banks beyond the limits of the section drilled \nForest Home  River is broad near level channel almost 300 m \nwide  \nFree water was evident at the lowest point of the \nriver bed \n \nClean sand/gravel ranged from 1.3 – 7.5 m, underlain by \nclayed sand/gravel, to bottom out in dense silt or clay \nbetween 12 m – 22.5 m \nRockyview  River is narrow, about 80 m wide  \nOut crops of sandstone and siltstone  \nFree water was evident in a water hole adjacent to \nthe lowest point \nDepth of clean sand/gravel ranged from 1m – 6.9 m in \nthe centre of the channel, underlain by clayed sand and \ngravel, bottom out in samdstone between 1 – 7.3 m  \nSuggestion that saturated sand and gravel may extend \nbeneath the right bank beyond the limits drilled  \nAquifer material below the normal water table is \nminimal \nGilbert \nBridge  \nRiver at this location has a broad channel (190 m \nwide); total width of river bed ~ 192 m  \nExposed sandstone out crops  \nFree water was evident in the low-flow channels \nClean sand/gravel was encountered in the bed (up to 12 \nm), underlain by clayed sand/gravel and cemented \ngranite sands \nNeem Trees  Three channels  \nFree water was evident in a small channel at the \nlowest point of the river bed \nDepth of clean sand/gravel ranged from 2 – 6.6 m, \nunderlain by clayed sand and gravel, bottom out in hard \nrock (generally granite) between 8 – 25.3 m \nGodfrey’s Standing water level was approximately 0.8 m \nbelow the bed \nDepth of clean sand/gravel ranged from 3.6 – 7 m  \nThere was also clayed sand/gravel over dense mottled \nclay \n \nSoil characteristics of the Gilbert \nFigure 8 (in Section 3.1) showed the multiple soil types in the Gilbert catchment (Petheram et al., 2013). \nThe spatial distribution of both soil texture and permeability are provided in Figure 35 and Figure 36. The \nproportion of the soil groups in the catchment and management consideration for irrigated agriculture and \nMAR are outlined in Table 14. It has been suggested that the deep alluvial soils on the catchment’s two \nmajor rivers, Gilbert and Etheridge, upstream of their confluence, are most suitable for irrigated \nagriculture (Petheram et al., 2013).  \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n47 \nSoil characteristics of the GRAP \nThe soil properties of the GRAP are shown in Figure 37 to Figure 41. The region between the Gilbert and \nEtheridge Rivers is characterised by soils with a sandy texture class and low clay percentage (Figure 37, \nFigure 38). This results in moderate to high soil permeability (Figure 39).  \n \nFigure 34 The area that the exploratory drilling program surveyed, with approximate start and finish points along the Gilbert River circled.  \n \nLand suitability  \nA land suitability assessment for a variety of crops and irrigation types as part of the FGARA report series \n(Bartley et al., 2013f). Furrow and spray wet season cotton were assessed (Figure 42), where irrigation \nwould supplement rainfall.  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n48 \nThe assessment was based largely on soil attributes and also incorporated climate and local landscape \ncharacteristics. Social, economic, flooding and salinity information was not included in the assessment. \nLand suitability was indicated by class (1 – 5), with the most limiting suitability subclass determining the \nfinal land suitability class in a particular area.  \nIn the Gilbert catchment, less than 1% of the land was classified as highly suitable or suitable with minor \nlimitations for cotton, under either furrow or spray irrigation (Bartley et al., 2013f). The main limitations \nthat reduced the suitability for cotton in the region were rockiness, slope and the resulting possibility of \nerosion, and limited soil moisture capacity in areas with shallow/light textured soils. Spray irrigation was \nreported as more moderately suitable then furrow irrigation based on area, 43% and 19%, respectively \n(Bartley et al., 2013f). Permeability was raised as an issue for furrow irrigations systems, with sandy, free \ndraining soils requiring more frequent irrigation with greater water usage (Bartley et al., 2013f). This would \nput pressure on the already surface water limited environment (Petheram et al., 2013). \n \nTable 14 The soil groups (grouped by soil generic group (SGG)), occurrence throughout the catchment and management consideration for \nirrigated agriculture and MAR.

This is due to the limitations outlined above, \nparticularly the perceived issue of permeability. Along the Gilbert River, furrow irrigation of cotton would \nbe considered conventionally unsuitable for this ‘low irrigation efficiency’ (Figure 43). However, furrow \nirrigation could be used with potential MAR infiltration schemes, especially in the soils around the Gilbert \nRiver, the theory being that the bed sands could be recharged, which would allow for extraction of \ngroundwater after the wet season.  \n \n MAR in a highly seasonal setting  \nMAR has been employed, developed and investigated overseas in climates similar to the Gilbert being \ncharacterised by a dry and wet/monsoon season.  \nIn Southern Florida, there are 30+ aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells (MAR using injection; Table 16, \nFigure 54) to recharge the Floridan aquifer system (Reese and Alvarez-Zarikian, 2004). This region is \nassociated with both hurricanes (Missimer et al., 2017) and a distinct wet and dry season (Lascody and \nMelbourne, 2002). The aim of this ASR scheme is to store excess water that is available during the wet \nseason, to be recovered during the dry season (Reese and Alvarez-Zarikian, 2004). The end uses of this \nscheme are varied, including agriculture, recreation and municipal water supply. When drinking water is \nthe end goal, the water quality requirements are stricter and non-saline areas of the aquifer are targeted. \nIssues identified during the operation of this scheme were the mixing of native aquifer water with recharge \nwater limiting recovery and captured water quality concerns. A successful ASR site within this scheme is \nBoynton Beach. In total, 16 recharge-recovery cycles have been conducted with an average of 2 cycles per \nyear. The quality of water recovered increased considerably over these cycles.  \nThroughout India there is a need to manage monsoon runoff to boost water resources for the dry season \nand limit flood damage, for which MAR has been employed using both infiltration and well structures \n(Holländer et al., 2009). The deliberate lowering of groundwater tables to assist in recharge during the \nmonsoon season is a method used (Holländer et al., 2009). Although there are many positive experiences \nwith MAR in India as well as promising research (Khan et al., 2014, Massuel et al., 2014, Brindha and \nPavelic, 2016, Pavelic et al., 2015, Alam et al., 2020, Holländer et al., 2009), clogging is a problem \nhighlighted again and again, due to the large amounts of suspended sediments present in monsoon runoff \n(Holländer et al., 2009, Soni et al., 2020). Not collecting the runoff from the initial heavy rain event has \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n56 \nbeen suggested as a way to reduced sediment loads (Soni et al., 2020). The economic feasibility of some \ntypes of MAR schemes in an Indian setting have been questioned, with recharge structures using wells \nbeing suggested as economically unfeasible (i.e., present value of costs exceed the present value of \nbenefits) (Soni et al., 2020). However, check dams which are an infiltration MAR scheme similar to a \nrecharge weir (Table 16, Figure 46) have shown benefit/cost ratios > 1 (Dashora et al., 2019). \n   \n  \nFigure 43 Predicted suitability for growing cotton using furrow irrigation in the area of interest, based on data from Bartley et al.

(2013e).  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n58 \nMAR has also been suggested as a future water management strategy for Thailand (Pavelic et al., 2012) \nand Brazil (Shubo et al., 2020), where flooding during the wet season and water shortages during the dry \nseason are common.   \n \n Past MAR assessments in the northern Gulf region \nThere has been one previous MAR suitability assessment conducted for the Gilbert catchment (Lennon et \nal., 2014). It argues for embracing conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources during the \nstrategic development of water resources in Northern Australia, for which MAR is incorporated.  \nThe alluvial aquifer surrounding the catchments main rivers was highlighted as having the greatest MAR \npotential. Extraction occurs from this aquifer currently. Based on calculations, the aquifer would be able to \nhold 8 GL/year of water recharged via MAR. However, it is not clear whether the recharged water would \nreside in the aquifer for a substantial amount of time, or if it would discharge into the river. Recharging \nfurther from the river may assist in increasing residence time.    \nThere has been an additional MAR opportunity assessment in the Mitchell catchment (Table 15) \n(Vanderzalm et al., 2018), a catchment neighbouring the Gilbert. The suitability assessment was based \npredominantly on physical aspects (e.g. soil permeability, depth of regolith, slope and source water quality, \nquantity and proximity). Alluvium in the region’s non-perennial streams was deemed the most suitable, \nand therefore the focus of this research. However, the assessment was limited by the lack of data on the \narea’s alluvium and, therefore, aquifer storage capacity would have to be confirmed before MAR potential \ncould be determined with any certainty. \nThe schemes put forward by both Lennon and Vanderzalm would aim to recharge relatively low volumes \ncompared to what would be required to establish an irrigation industry at a site that has a heavy \ndependence on groundwater. Another limitation of these studies was that existing water management \nplans (and ‘entitlements’) were not considered in order to determine source water availability or \nextraction of recharge water.   \nTable 15 Summary of schemes investigated in the Mitchell (Source: Vanderzalm et al.

Recharge weirs aim to slow flows in order to increase recharge into unconfined aquifers. \nMultiple recharge weirs could be installed along one or multiple river courses in a catchment (allowing for \nincremental development) and possible locations could be small streams off the Gilbert River targeting the \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n59 \nhorizontal extent of bed sands. Infiltration basins aim to recharge unconfined aquifers through pumping or \ndiverting water from river into off stream storage. In the Gilbert, possible locations are the bed sand \ndeposits that extend beyond the river channel. Recharge release is a strategy suggested by CSIRO FGARA \nreports in other North Queensland catchments, which would work in conjunction with the proposed \nGreenhills Dam to service the bed sands downstream of the dam (through to Strathmore). The aim would \nbe to strategically release surface water from dams for infiltration through the downstream natural river \nchannel and the dam would act as as a settling pond (treatment). \n \nTable 16 Summary of managed aquifer recharge strategies \nType Aims to…  Notes  \nLeaky Weir \n(Figure 45) \nslow flow to rehydrate land. - not an explicit MAR technique; linked to regenerative \nagriculture practices  \nRecharge Weir \n(Figure 46) \nslow flow to increase recharge.  - weirs built to detain water, allowing increased time to \ninfiltrate  \n- targets unconfined aquifer  \n- clogging can be a management issue \n- opportunity for multiple recharge weirs to be \ninstalled along one or multiple river courses in a \ncatchment (could occur incrementally)   \nSand Dam \n[Overseas]  \n(Figure 47, Figure \n48) \ngradually build up sand behind a dam wall to \nstore water in. \n- dam wall is built gradually over dry seasons \n- requires: an ephemeral river, sandy sediment, \n(shallow) bedrock to anchor the dam to  \n- bedrock has to be impermeable to stop the water \nheld in the built-up sediment from being lost   \n- bonus of limiting sediment discharge at mouth of \nriver \nSands Dams \n[Burdekin, QLD] \n(Figure 49) \nhold back releases from upstream storages \ncreating levels that are practical for pumping.  \n- suited to large rivers where weirs would be \nimpractical and expensive  \n- the low embankments of sand are constructed (and \nreconstructed) in the dry season when periods of \nlow/no flow allow machinery access  \n- cheap but require annual rebuilding \nassociated with seepage losses \nUnderground \nDam \n(Figure 50)  \nretain flood flows in alluvium via the use of an \nunderground impediment. \n- used in ephemeral settings  \n- unconfined aquifer above the underground dam in \nconfined horizontally    \nRecharge Release \n(Figure 51) \nstrategically release surface water from dams \nfor infiltration through the downstream \nnatural river channel. \n- release rates typically match the infiltration capacity \ninto underlying unconfirmed aquifers     \n- dam acts as settling pond (treatment)   \nInfiltration Basin  \n(Figure 52, Figure \n53)  \nrecharge unconfined aquifers through \ninfiltration via pumping or diverting water \nfrom river into off stream storage. \n- basin scrapping (picture below) often required to \nremove built up sediment \nInjection Well  \n(Figure 54) \ninject water into a confined or semi-confined \naquifer via a well. \n- water can be injected under pressure or under gravity  \n- wells can become clogged with sediment so pre-\ntreatment of water to be injected or backwashing of \nwell can be used \n \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n60 \n \nFigure 45 Comparison of a landscape pre- and post-leaky weir installation.

Given the limited hydrogeological \ninformation available, some localised areas with greater yields are possible. However, overall, these \nsandstone aquifers do not hold much promise in terms of supporting irrigated agricultural development.  \nBore yields from the alluvial bed sands hold more potential. In a phone interview in March 2019, one \nfarmer in the region thought that from his irrigation system – three spear bores in the river bed and one \nout of the river bed – he could extract 30 L/s (2.6 ML/day) within his license of up to 20 ML/day. At the \nGilbert River Agricultural Forum in April 2021, spear bores were being used to irrigate research trial plots of \ncotton, mung beans and other crops on this property and a table grape trial and established mango \norchard on other properties. As noted in Section 5.1.2, yields from these bores can vary over time and \nspace as the dry season progresses.  \nSalinity should not be a constraint to recovery efficiency as there are no reports of elevated salinities in the \nalluvial or other aquifers with the GRAP. Recovery efficiency is likely to be constrained by the need to \nguarantee ecological outcomes (see Section 5.5). \n \n Monitoring design to manage effects \nThere are over 400 registered bores in the catchment (Figure 55) and many in the GRAP (Figure 56) that \ncould be used for monitoring groundwater depths during/after periods of recharge and extraction. If the \nbed sands were to be the target aquifer of the MAR scheme, there would likely need to be an investment \nin monitoring due to the absence of information in this area. Reviews of the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \nidentify localized measurements of bed sands water levels in the Gilbert River as a key knowledge gap \n(DNRME, 2018b). Further reports reviewing water managed under the Water Plan (Gulf) mirror this, \nhighlighting that no monitoring data is available to assess the impact of water extraction on bed sand \necosystems (DNRME, 2018a). The expansion of monitoring into the groundwater managed under the \nWater Plan (Gulf) 2007 is in line with Plan requirements (Chapter 6 Section 91).  \nThere are currently two monitoring bores in the catchment (Chadshunt and Abingdon Downs Road 74) \n(Figure 56), with data collection commencing in 2014 for both sites. Both of these bores are located in the \ndeeper sandstone aquifers.   \nMonitoring design could be driven by the ‘action-state-consequence’ framework (Figure 57), which was \ndeveloped after consulting the relevant literature (summarised in 5.5.4). This framework asks a range of \nquestions based on the action that is proposed to be taken: \n• What consequences might we expect? \n• What states might we want to monitor? \n• Who might be involved? How and why?  \nAn example of the complete framework based on the recharge release scenario is provided in Figure 58. \n  \n                                                       \n74 https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au, accessed 1st November 2020  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n64 \n \nFigure 55 Bores in the Gilbert catchment  (Source: Jolly et al., 2013). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n65 \n \nFigure 56 Bores in the area of interest, including monitoring bores.

The MAR costs are based \non the Burdekin scheme, a developed water management scheme in QLD that employs infiltration basins \nto replenish the aquifers below agricultural land, dominated by sugarcane cropping (Bristow et al., 2000). \nDue to the ‘greenfields’ nature of irrigated agriculture in the Gilbert catchment, all water infrastructure \ntypes would incur significant capital costs and be required to set up water distribution networks. \nEstablishing local processing facilities is also not without risk (Ash et al., 2017). However, this is a benefit \nfor MAR as significant investment hasn’t already been directed to infrastructure to support surface \nstorage, unlike in established irrigation regions (Evans and Dillon, 2017). \nOf major importance to the development of an irrigated agriculture industry in the region, regardless of \nwater delivery mechanism, is the establishment of local processing facilitates, to overcome the regions \nremoteness (Ash et al., 2017). Petheram et al. (2013) estimated that the break-even crop yield for irrigated \ncotton produced in the Gilbert catchment would more than half if a local cotton gin was established. \nMultiple scenarios, with varying details (e.g., area planted, yield), are presented in Section 5.4.1. All \npresented scenarios would theoretically produce enough cotton to support a local gin. The financial \nviability of cotton in particular could be further improved by using the by-product of ginning, cottonseed, \nas supplement fodder for cattle, the main industry in the catchment (Petheram et al., 2013, Álvarez-\nRomero, 2015).   \n \n Local cotton gin \nThe financial viability of a local irrigated agriculture industry has been suggested to depend on the \nestablishment of local processing facilities, for example, a local cotton gin (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., \n2020, Petheram et al., 2013, Ash and Watson, 2018). With the ability to process at a local gin, farmers \ncould pay up to $263/ML for water and break even (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). It is estimated \nthat establishing a cotton gin in the region would cost $30 – 40 million (Matz, 2020).   \nMultiple scenarios have been developed based on published values to understand how irrigation \nrequirements, area under irrigation and yields influence the gross value of the hypothetical irrigation \nindustry (Table 17). The average price of cotton per bale is set at $500, based on the average value \nproposed by Cluff (2017). The irrigation requirement is also kept constant based on the median irrigation \nrequirement of 3.2 ML/ha (Petheram et al., 2013). The median potential yield is based on the value \nproposed by Petheram et al. (2013) for irrigated cotton – 8.5 bales/ha. In scenario 5, a substantially smaller \npotential yield is used based on results from a trial of non-irrigation cotton in the Gilbert catchment (Cluff, \n2017). This is used as a worse-case yield scenario.  \nThe major variation between the scenarios is the area of cotton that is planted (Table 17). Both scenario 1 \nand 5 use the value of 35,000 ha, based on the area estimated to be required to support a local gin by Cluff \n(2017). A much smaller planted area was used in scenario 2, with the aim of producing the minimum bales \nsuggested to support a local gin by Petheram et al. (2013). Similar bale numbers (67,500) are proposed by \nAsh and Gleeson (2014), as referenced in Matz (2020). Scenarios 3 and 4 are based on the land deemed \nmoderately suited for spray and flood irrigated cotton cropping, respectively (Petheram et al., 2013). These \nareas are best case scenarios where all moderately suitable land is sown.  \nAt the Gilbert River Agricultural Forum, in April 2021, a presentation was given that outlined a scoping \nstudy looking at different locations for a cotton gin in North Queensland (North Queensland Cotton Gin \nFeasibility Study). This study is being undertaken on behalf of the Mount Isa to Townsville Economic \nDevelopment Zone (MITEZ) and will suggest the most feasible locations for cotton gins in North \nQueensland to service the developing cotton industry in the region. The report is due to be delivered in the \nmiddle of 2021. As of the submission of this final report the study has not been published but the North \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n68 \nWest Star has reported that Hughenden and Richmond are the preferred locations for the gin. 77 These \nsites would reduce the travel time from Georgetown by about half from the nearest gin currently in \noperation (located in Emerald). \n \nTable 17 Scenarios based on published values to assess possible yields and values of cotton cropping in the Gilbert River catchment.  \nScenario  Median \nIrrigation \nRequirement \n(ML/ha) \nMedian \nPotential \nYield \n(bales/ha) \nCotton in \nArea (ha) \nWater \nNeeds \n(ML)  \nYield (bales)  Average price \nof cotton per \ngin bale ($) \n \nGross Value \n($) \nScenario 1  \n \n3.2 8.5 35,000 112,000  297,500 500 148,750,000 \nScenario 2 \n  \n3.2 8.5 6,000 19,200  51,000 \n \n500 25,500,000 \nScenario 3 \n \n3.2 8.5 2,000,000 6,400,000  17,000,000 500 8,500,000,000 \nScenario 4 \n \n3.2 8.5 900,000 2,880,000  7,650,000 500 3,825,000,000 \nScenario 5 3.2 2 35,000 112,000  70,000 \n \n500 35,000,000 \n \n \n Estimated costs of off-stream storage  \nOff-stream storages (i.e. farm dams) have been suggested as more challenging and costly than larger in-\nstream storages in the Gilbert catchment due to the need to mitigate sandy textured soils with, for \nexample, synthetic liners (Figure 36) (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020, Petheram et al., 2013). This is of \nparticular importance in the GRAP (Figure 37, Figure 39), where Petheram et al. (2013) suggested that \nthere are few locations adjacent to the Gilbert River that are suitable for off-stream storage (Figure 59).  \nShort term off-stream water storage (4 months) has been suggested to cost at least $140/ML, increasing to \n$240/ML when storage time is increased to 12 months (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020, Petheram et \nal., 2013). These costs are higher than larger in-stream dams (Section 5.4.3) due to increased evaporative \nand seepage losses (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). However, even when accounting for 12-month \nstorage, it may still be possible for a cotton farmer to make a small profit using off-stream storage if a local \ngin was to be built 78. \nThe construction and operation cost of a 1000 ML ring tank (form of surface storage) and pumping system \nare outlined in Table 18. The cost of the pumping infrastructure outlined in Table 18 would fill the ring tank \nin five days as a way to capture the full entitlement in the majority of years. It is therefore possible to use a \nsmaller and lower cost pump, but this would increase the number of days to fill the ring tank and therefore \ndecrease the possibility of the full entitlement being taken up. The cost of supply channels are not \nincluded, as are highly situation dependent. It should also be that this analysis was completed in 2013, so \nprices would be reflective of that time.   \nThere are situations where off-stream surface water storage may be more technically and financially \nfeasible than what is suggested above. The characteristics that would improve the feasibility of off-stream \nstorages are:  \n• if there was a natural dam site that could be further enhanced \n• sites with soil of low infiltration  \n• sites close to good agricultural soil to minimise pumping costs (if required)  \n                                                       \n77 https://www.northweststar.com.au/story/7436935/nq-cotton-gin-is-viable-says-mitez-study/, accessed 6 December 2021 \n78 Section 5.4.1 With a gin in Georgetown, farmers could pay $263/ ML for water and break-even \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n69 \n• water captured by overland flow to remove capital cost of canal construction from the river and on-\ngoing pumping costs to extract water from the river  \n• captured water is used completely within a short period after the completion of the wet season \n(e.g., to finish crop) to minimise evaporation losses  \n \n \nFigure 59 Suitability for off-stream water storages in the Gilbert catchment. Here suitability is based on landscape and soil attributes (Source: \nPetheram et al., 2013).  \nTable 18 Estimated construction and operation costs for a surface storage in the Gilbert catchment, assuming a discount rate of 7% (Source: \nPetheram et al., 2013). \nItem Capital cost ($) Lifespan (Years) Equivalent annual \ncapital cost ($) \nAnnual operation and \nmaintenance cost ($)  \nOff-stream storage (ring tank) 1,000,000 40 75,000 10,000 \nPumping infrastructure 170,000 15 18,650 3,400 \nPumping cost (diesel) - - - 16,000 \n \n Estimate costs of large in-stream storage  \nThe recent detailed business case (DBC) for the proposed Gilbert River Irrigation Project outlined the costs, \nboth of construction and operation/maintenance, of a large in-stream dam on the Gilbert River (Jacobs \nAustralia Pty Limited., 2020). Water entitlements costs and economic benefit were also defined (Jacobs \nAustralia Pty Limited., 2020). \nThe estimated capital cost of the project is $785 million, $429 million for dam construction and $355 \nmillion for the delivery network and water purchase cost (Table 19) (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020).  \n \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n70 \nTable 19 Estimated capital expenditure for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project dam, as set out in the detailed business case (Jacobs Australia Pty \nLimited., 2020) \nDescription  Capital cost ($ million) \nDam 429.3 \nDistribution network 342.3 \nWater purchase  13 \nTotal  784.6 \n \nThe annual operating cost was estimated to be $5.6 million. The annual refurbishment cost was estimated \nto be $3.8 million (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). These costs are planned to be met through annual \nwater charges (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020).  \nThe project is set to deliver 130 GL of water entitlements per year, split into 90 GL of high priority \nallocations available between February and December (~330 days) and 40 GL of medium priority \nallocations delivered between February and May (~100 days) (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). The \npayment structure for entitlements is divided into two stages; an up-front capital contribution (Table 20) \nand annual water charges (Table 21) (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). Based on demand assessment it \nis expected that 100% of the allocations would be pre-sold for the prices listed (Table 20) (Jacobs Australia \nPty Limited., 2020). The annuals charges are below those estimated by CSIRO of $100/ML per annum - \n$140/ML per annum (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020, Petheram et al., 2013). \nTable 20  Up-front customer capital contributions for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project dam, as set out in the detailed business case (Jacobs \nAustralia Pty Limited., 2020) \nPriority of Allocation  Cost ($/ML) \nHigh 3,000 \nMedium  1,000 \n \nTable 21  Annual water charges for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project dam, as set out in the detailed business case (Jacobs Australia Pty \nLimited., 2020) \nCharge  Cost  \nFixed (Part A) $60/ML per annum \nVariable (Part B) $20/ ML of metered water use \nTotal  $80/ML per annum \n \nThe total economic benefit of the project is estimated to be $839 million, resulting in a net economic \nbenefit of $108 million and a benefit cost ratio of 1.15 (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). This, and the \nabove charges, are based on the assumptions that: \n• 100% of water entitlements are sold pre-construction, bringing in capital contributions of $310 \nmillion \n• The funding shortfall for construction will be covered via government funding to keep the price of \nannual charges low and support uptake  \n• Initial purchase of the water allocation from the QLD Government, via unallocated reserve as per \nthe Gulf Water Plan, cost $100/ML, for a total of $13,000,000. (This price reflects similar recent \ntransactions) \nHowever, the modelled water prices for irrigators vary substantially based on government contributions \n(Table 22) (Figure 60) (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020).

The replenishment occurs at multiple locations via the use \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n73 \nof infiltration basins (Figure 52) and on-farm practices such as ‘recycling’, ‘water spreading’ and recharge \nchannels (Bristow et al., 2000). The infiltration basins in the scheme have a very high recharge capacity - up \nto 20 ML/day (Dillon et al., 2009b). ‘Recycling’ refers to the use of private production bores to return \nexcess irrigation water back to the groundwater storage through the soil (Bristow et al., 2000). ‘Water \nspreading’ is where river water that is too turbid to be infiltrated in the basins is made available to \nirrigators, which some of this water recharging the aquifer past irrigation. Water spreading is managed by \nLower Burdekin Water, and prevents to silting up of infiltration basins, instead spreading the silt load \nacross the scheme area (Bristow et al., 2000). The estimates of artificial recharge range from 45 GL/year \n(Dillon et al., 2009b) to 96 GL/year (Bristow et al., 2000).   \nThe operational, maintenance and infrastructure costs for the scheme are funded by the players of the \nbenefiting irrigated agricultural industry, namely growers and millers of sugarcane, the dominant crop of \nthe region (Bristow et al., 2000). The dominance of sugarcane in the region results in four sugar mills \nservicing the area (Ash and Watson, 2018). The long-term viability of the mills is ensured via contractual \nagreements with growers and the establishment of minimum quotas (Ash and Watson, 2018). \nTable 24 provides a breakdown of costs, both capital and operational, for the Burdekin scheme, compiled \nfrom numerous sources. The levelized cost is similar to the water costs for the proposed dam (Table 21, \nTable 22, Figure 60). The operating costs of the MAR, based on the calculated operational costs of the 51 \ninfiltration basins managed by Lower Burdekin Water (Table 24), is less than the estimate for the proposed \ndam (Section 5.4.3). \n \nTable 24 Breakdown of costs in the Burdekin scheme  \nCapital/Activity Cost Cost Reference Year  Source \nConstruction of two \ninfiltration basins   \n$2.1 million  2009 (Dillon et al., 2009b) \nOperation and \nmaintenance costs of two \ninfiltration basins   \n$85,000 2009 (Dillon et al., 2009b) \nOperation and \nmaintenance costs of the \n51 infiltration basins of \nscheme based in value for \ntwo basins in Dillon et al. \n(2009b) \n$2.17 million 2009 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/about-\nus-2/history/north-board/  \nhttp://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/about-\nus-2/history/south-board/  \nRecharge and recovery of \nunconfined aquifer via \ninfiltration basins  \n$0.07/kL  \n($0.05/kL recharge + \n$0.02/kL recovery \nfrom high yielding \nbores) \n-  (Dillon et al., 2009b) \nWater base rate $16.48/ML - \n$19.75/ML  \n2020/21 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/08/ADM012-\nSchedule-of-Rates-Charges-2020-21.pdf, \naccessed 5th March 2021 \nAquifer Maintenance – \nInfiltration base scrapping  \n$18,167 \nCost for two-year \nperiod as scrapping \noccurs every 2 years \n(Dillon et al., 2009b) \n2018/19 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/QAO-Approved-\nAnnual-Financial-Statements-2018-19.pdf, \naccessed 5th March  \nLevelised cost  $80/ML 2017 (Vanderzalm et al., 2018) \n \nEstimated costs of three scheme types (recharge release, infiltration basin and recharge weir) in the \nMitchell Catchment were provided in Table 15. Levelised costs of $48/ML for a scheme based on recharge \nrelease reflect the assumed existence of a large dam; the higher capital costs and operational costs for \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n74 \nschemes based on infiltration basins or recharge weir account for the higher estimated levelised costs \n($82/ML and $172/ML). It should be noted that schemes based on either or both of these two recharge \nstrategies could be incrementally developed.  \n \n Potential benefits for community  \nThe building of water infrastructure and the expansion of agricultural production in the region would bring \neconomic benefits to the community. Based on the availability of additional water resulting from the \nproposed dam, over 2,000 jobs are forecast to the be created, both directly in the agriculture industry and \nindirectly in other industries (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). The establishment of a local processing \nfacility (e.g., cotton gin) would assist in providing new employment opportunities for the region (Jacobs \nAustralia Pty Limited., 2020). \nBased on financial analysis, the proposed dam would have a 1:1.15 direct economic return to the \ncommunity (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). This analysis excluded employment created by the \nproject.  \n \n5.5 Environmental risks  \nThis section considers the potential implication of water development for agriculture in the Gilbert River \nwith emphasis on the ecosystems and fauna and flora that rely (at least in part) on the bed sands adjacent \nto the Gilbert River in the GRAP. An overview of the environmental importance and ecological \ncharacteristics of the catchment is provided in Section 5.5.1. This is followed by a discussion of wetland \nand floodplain processes (Section 5.5.2) and the constraints on water extractions that are needed to \nminimise environmental impacts (Section 5.5.3). This leads into a summary of approaches and frameworks \nfrom the literature that have been used to design or inform ‘sustainable irrigation development’ (Section \n5.5.4). \n \n Environmental assets \nVegetation \nThe majority of the vegetation communities in the Gilbert catchment are classified as ‘not of concern’ \n(Figure 61), based on the biodiversity codes from the Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Petheram et al., \n2013). This category is defined as: Remnant vegetation is over 30% of its pre-clearing extent across the \nbioregion, and the remnant area is greater than 10,000 ha. The categories here are based exclusively on \ncurrent remnant vegetation extent compared to its pre-clearing extent and the current remnant \nvegetation area (Petheram et al., 2013). Ford (2010) identified threatened species in a 1,190 km2 area \ntowards the headwaters of the Gilbert River and into the Einasleigh Uplands Bioregion, identifying pockets \nof near threatened and vulnerable species based on the threatened species list produced by Queensland \nGovernment. Regions of regulated vegetation, which determine clearing requirements 80, for the GRAP are \nshown in Figure 62.   \n                                                       \n80 https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/1447098/general-guide-vegetation-clearing-codes.pdf, \naccessed 17 March 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n75 \n \nFigure 61 Status of regional ecosystem (vegetation) biodiversity for the Gilbert catchment  (Source: Petheram et al., 2013). \n \nFauna  \nImpediments, such as instream dams, pose a risk to the movement of fish species. Species at particular risk \nin the Gilbert catchment included barramundi (Lates calcarifer), freshwater sawfish (Pristis microdon) and \nfreshwater whipray (Himantura dalyensis) (Petheram et al., 2013).  Other aquatic species in the catchment \nmay be less impacted by the building of infrastructure, but instead possibly be affected by changes in flow \nregimes and waterholes. These species include freshwater turtles, frogs, crustaceans and crocodiles \n(Petheram et al., 2013).   \n \nWaterholes \nThe waterholes that persist into the dry season in the Gilbert catchment provide habitat for a wide range \nof aquatic species, especially during the dry season in intermittently flowing rivers (Waltham et al., 2013).  \nThe water level in most waterholes in river reaches are in equilibrium with the water table of the river bed \nsands (Petheram et al., 2013). Pumping water from the bed sands has been suggested to cause the water \nlevel in nearby water holes to drop at a faster than usual rate (Petheram et al., 2013). Compared to the \nother major river in the catchment, the Einasleigh River, the Gilbert River has less persistent and smaller \nwaterholes (see Figure 12). The waterholes that form in the Gilbert River once flow has stopped are mobile \nin nature, forming in different locations at the end of each wet season (Petheram et al., 2013). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n76 \nGood water quality, with high clarity, is important to ensure efficient light penetration at all depths of \nwaterholes (Petheram et al., 2013). Other quality characteristics, for example temperature and dissolved \noxygen concentration, can cause stress on the flora and fauna that seek refuge in the waterholes \nthroughout the dry season (Petheram et al., 2013).    \n \n \nFigure 62 Regulated vegetation mapping based on QLD Matters of State Environmental Significance (MSES). \nIn terms of the impact of possible irrigated agriculture development on waterhole ecology, the major \nthreats are (Waltham et al., 2013): \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n77 \n1. Large sediment loss, being further exacerbated when stubble retention and minimum tillage \npractices are not employed  \n2. Large nutrient (e.g., phosphorus and nitrogen) losses \n3. Large herbicide losses \nLarge herbicide losses may be reduced when planting cotton, as GM cotton varieties do not require the \nsame magnitude of herbicide and pesticide use compared to other crops. (Waltham et al., 2013). \n \nGroundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) \nTea-tree (Melaleuca spp.) forests and woodland are thought to be the major groundwater dependent \necosystem (GDE) in Northern Australia (O’Grady et al., 2006, Eamus et al., 2006, Eamus et al., 2016), with \noccurrences noted in the Gilbert catchment  (Ford, 2010). These ecosystems have been described as \nopportunistic users of groundwater and are not entirely reliant upon groundwater (Murray et al., 2003).  \nIn the Gilbert catchment, Ford (2010) identified that a small tea-tree (Melaleuca leucadendra) community \non creek alluvium was fed by an underlying semi-permanent sandstone spring. The springs of the Gilbert \ncatchment are concentrated in the uplands/headwaters of the system (Figure 70), so it is plausible that \nGDEs are present there. How this relates to the middle reaches of the Gilbert River is less clear; however \nfrom the Australia wide maps produced by Doody et al. (2017), the Gilbert catchment has areas with high \npotential of being GDEs, both in terms of vegetation ecosystems (Figure 63, Figure 64) and ecosystems that \nrequire surface expression of groundwater (Figure 65). The mid lengths of the Gilbert River, the GRAP, are \npredicted to have a high potential of being a GDE based on national assessments (Figure 64, Figure 65). \nHowever, there are no known GDEs in the GRAP based on this assessment (Figure 65). Determining the \ndegree of dependency of an ecosystem on groundwater is difficult, requiring years of site study (Eamus et \nal., 2006, Eamus et al., 2016) and this has not been done in the Gilbert catchment. If the ecosystem is an \nopportunistic user of groundwater it may require study during drought to determine dependency (Eamus \net al., 2006, Eamus et al., 2016). However, there are ways to infer an ecosystems groundwater \ndependence, including studying river flows, wetlands, groundwater levels and remote sensing imagery \n(Eamus et al., 2006, Eamus et al., 2016). Such methods could be incorporated into a full impact assessment \nof the AOI.  \nThreats to GDEs include depleting groundwater reserves, altering groundwater regimes and degrading \ngroundwater quality (Eamus et al., 2006, Eamus et al., 2016). \nNo monitoring data is available to assess the impact of water take on bed sand ecosystems. However, a \nrisk assessment by the QLD Department of Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts \n(DSITIA, 2014) looked at the impact of water extraction from the bed sands of the Gilbert River on riparian \nvegetation (DNRME, 2018a, DSITIA, 2014). This study suggested that under full utilisation of entitlements, \ndrawdown in the bed sands would be below the root zone (2.5 m depth) for a small percentage (4.5%) of \nthe simulation period (DNRME, 2018a, DSITIA, 2014). This estimated amount of drawdown was considered \nlow risk to adult trees although establishment of Melaleuca seedlings may be negatively affected (DNRME, \n2018a, DSITIA, 2014). However, full utilisation of bed sand entitlements has not occurred in the past \nseveral years (Section 5.2.1) (DNRME, 2018a). \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n78 \n \nFigure 63 Potential groundwater dependent ecosystems of the Gilbert catchment and neighbouring areas that rely on the subsurface presence \nof groundwater (e.g., vegetation).

Water can be \nsupplied to the hyporheic zone from both the overlying river and the underlying aquifers (Stanford and \nWard, 1993, Boulton et al., 1998). Water from both these sources frequently exchanges (Boulton, 2007). \nHyporheic flows are able to provide water to nearby wetlands, as well as support an ecosystem \nthemselves.   \n \nFigure 66 Depiction of the hyporheic zone (Source: Biddulph, 2015). \nAlthough noted as an important ecosystem in many of the documents that inform water policy in the Gulf \nand the Gilbert River (see Section 5.7.1), little is known about the hyporheic zone of Gulf rivers (Close et al., \n2012).  \nSubsurface hyporheic flows in the Gilbert River extend beyond the cease-to-flow period and into the dry \nseason (Close et al., 2012). These flows are sustained by groundwater discharge (Kennard et al., 2011) from \ndeep sand beds in the mid to low reaches of the river (Close et al., 2012). The bed sands of the Gilbert \nRiver are home to a diverse range of aquatic fauna (Greiner et al., 2009). \nPresumed ecologically important subsurface flows in the hyporheic zone of Gulf rivers may be impacted by \nwater development, both groundwater and surface water (Close et al., 2012). The water to meet the needs \nof agriculture activities, besides grazing, along the Gilbert River are predominantly sourced from the near-\nperennial hyporheic flows in the river bed sands (Close et al., 2012). There is concern that the current \nwater licences from the bed sands may be close to or at the upper limit (Close et al., 2012). Because of this, \nthere may already be current impacts of this extraction on the hyporheic zone (e.g., persistence, duration \nof surface pools for refugia, impacts on hyporheic fauna) but, if occurring, these impacts are not well \nknown or documented (Close et al., 2012).  \n \nWetlands and floodplains \nThere are wetlands in the Gilbert catchment (Figure 70) and the GRAP (Figure 67). These wetlands are \ncommonly associated with the rivers and creeks of the area (Figure 67). Wetland inundation is an \nimportant ecological process in the catchment (see Section 5.5.2).  \n                                                       \n83 http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/gde/map.shtml, accessed 12 March 2021  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n82 \nOther than the larger coastal floodplains, the seasonal nature of the catchment means that smaller \nfloodplains occur throughout the Gilbert catchment, away from major watercourses (Figure 68). Many of \nthese areas experience high recharge rates (Figure 68).  \n \n \nFigure 67 Wetlands in the GRAP.

Nutrients from the estuary stimulate primary production which provide food \nfor fish, prawns and crabs (Petheram et al., 2013). Streamflow into the estuaries also promotes movement \n                                                       \n85 http://qldspatial.information.qld.gov.au/catalogue/custom/viewMetadataDetails.page?uuid=%7B0944E8CD-8618-4100-\nB7DC-8C87CC74736C%7D, accessed 18 March 2021 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n84 \nof species out of the estuaries for reproduction and increases catchability (Figure 69) (Petheram et al., \n2013, Griffiths et al., 2014). This is true for the Gulf of Carpentaria prawn fishery, which experiences a \nstrong positive relationship between streamflow and fishery production; i.e. higher number of prawn \nlandings after an above average wet season (Petheram et al., 2013). The FGARA research concluded that \nthe relationship between streamflow, estuaries and fisheries productivity should be considered from both \nan environmental and economic perspective when assessing suitability of an area to water resource \ndevelopment (Petheram et al., 2013). In the Gilbert catchment and surrounding catchments, a model-\nbased study suggested that water extraction during low flow periods would have the greatest impact on \nfishery catch (Broadley et al., 2020). Protecting low flows, especially during dry years, should act to \npreserve the link between terrestrial and marine environments, a link that the fisheries industries in the \nGulf rely on (Broadley et al., 2020). Both a fisheries industry and an agriculture industry in the Gilbert (and \nother Gulf catchments) are thought to be feasible if water extraction for agriculture occurs during periods \nof high flows (Broadley et al., 2020).   \n \n \nFigure 69 Conceptual model of the life history of the White Banana Prawn (Penaeus merguiensis) illustrating its use of marine and estuarine \nhabitats in the Gulf of Carpentaria Source: Griffiths et al. (2014). \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n85 \nImportant/protected areas  \nThere are multiple recognised areas of ecological importance in the Gilbert catchment (Petheram et al., \n2013, CSIRO, 2009, Karim et al., 2015) (Figure 70).  \n \n \nFigure 70 Important ecological assets and protected areas in the Gilbert catchment (Source: Petheram et al., 2013). \n \n Wetland and floodplain processes    \nThe connection of wetlands and floodplains in the Gilbert catchment to rivers during high flow periods \nallows for migration of species and nutrients exchanged between these systems that are disconnected for \nthe dry season (Petheram et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2015). It follows that changes to the frequency and \nmagnitude of high flows could disrupt these processes and have environmental consequences.  \nWetlands in the Gilbert catchment are thought to be dependent on flood pulses to facilitate biophysical \nexchanges (Karim et al., 2015). Previous modelling work showed that the construction of large instream \ndams could reduce the duration of connectivity between the wetlands and rivers in the Gilbert and Flinders \ncatchments by 2% (Karim et al., 2015). This reduction in connectivity is less than the modelled reduction \nresulting from a drier climate (Karim et al., 2015).   \nA recent report focused in both the Gilbert and neighbouring Flinders catchments investigated the main \ndrivers of floodplain inundation (Ndehedehe, 2020). From this research it was suggested that local rainfall \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n86 \nover the floodplain area (i.e., downstream of the convergence of the Gilbert and Einasleigh Rivers) was the \nmain driver of floodplain inundation extent (Ndehedehe, 2020). However, the importance of river \ndischarge should not be understated, in terms of both floodplain inundation extent and floodplain \nproductivity (Ndehedehe, 2020). The larger rainfall volumes and large discharge volumes in the Gilbert \ncatchment suggest that, compared to the Flinders, water extraction and infrastructure (e.g., dams) \nupstream of the floodplains will be less likely to disrupt floodplain processes (Ndehedehe, 2020). This is not \nto say that water development will have no effect on floodplain inundation processes in the Gilbert \ncatchment, with possible consequences being changes to flow variability and discharge volumes \n(Ndehedehe, 2020). The riparian vegetation present in the catchment acts to filter the runoff before it \nreaches streams and rivers, while reducing erosion (Petheram et al., 2013).   \nFloodplain inundation also has a direct link to the formation of aquatic habitats including waterholes \n(Ndehedehe, 2020). Both the persistence of waterholes and the accumulation of biomass within them is \nlinked to floodplains rivers exceeding their banks during extreme wet periods (Ndehedehe, 2020).    \nIdentified threats to these areas include cattle grazing, feral pigs and infestation of rubber vine \n(Cryptostegia grandiflora) and other invasive flora species (Waltham et al., 2013).  \n \n Timing of water extraction to minimise environmental impacts  \nThe impacts of surface water extractions from the river (or bed sands) in the Gilbert catchment, and within \nthe GRAP, will vary depending on when water is extracted from the system. The Northern Gulf inland \nwaters regional NRM assessment (NGRMG, 2015) summarised potential threats by flow class from \nproposed surface water development in the Gilbert Catchment – the proposed Greenhills and Dagworth \ndams – and mitigation strategies to address the threats (Table 25). \n \nHigh flows \nAn event thought to have major environmental benefit in the North is the first flush event (Petheram et al., \n2013). The first flush event renews streams and waterholes that haven’t seen substantial rainfall since the \nend of the last wet season (Petheram et al., 2013). It has been suggested that extraction of water should \noccur after this first flush event (i.e., first large rainfall event of the season), however identifying what \nconstitutes a first flush event is problematic; set rules on extraction that consider first flush avoidance are \ndifficult to define (Petheram et al., 2013).  \nAs long as water extractions avoid the first flush event, it has been proposed that environmental impacts \ncan be minimized by only extracting water during periods of high flows (Petheram et al., 2013, Broadley et \nal., 2020). This is mirrored in the current surface water policy, where flow restrictions have been set for the \ncurrently unallocated water (Table 10, Figure 23, Figure 24).    \n \nLow flows \nLike many other processes in the Gilbert catchment the lack of data complicates the identification of \ndefinite ecological impacts resulting from changes to the system (CSIRO, 2009). Site-specific flow metrics \nrelating to ecology, the impacts on ecosystems to alterations in low or zero flows and the importance on \ninundation extent and duration are all significant unknowns (CSIRO, 2009).  \n \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n87 \nTable 25 Potential impacts of proposed surface water resource development in the Gilbert River (by flow class) and strategies identified that \nwould mitigate these impacts (Source: NGRMG, 2015). \nFlow Class Potential threats from water \nresource development \nRelated ecosystem components Mitigation strategies proposed in \nthe Gilbert* \nNo flow – \nlow flow \nCapture of low flows by storages \nand increase in the duration and \nnumber of no flow spells \n \nPumping of waterholes and bed \nsands during spells without flow \nWaterholes as refugia Stable flow \nspawning fish (Eastern rainbowfish) \nInflow-outflow rules proposed for \nboth Dagworth and Green Hills \nDams.  \nLow – \nmedium \nflow \nCapture of low and medium flows \nby storages \n \nLoss of seasonal migratory \nopportunities and cues \n \nLoss of ephemeral nature of system \nMigratory fish (Hyrtl’s tandan, \nNarrow-fronted catfish, Spangled \nperch and Largetooth sawfish) \nAs above \nHigh flow \n(1 in 2-\nyear flow \nevents) \nCapture of high flows by instream \nstorages and water harvesting \n \nLoss of seasonal migratory \nopportunities and cues \n \nReduced connectivity of system \nFreshwater turtles (Northern \nsnakenecked turtle, Cann’s \nlong-necked turtle) \n \nFluvial geomorphology and \nriver forming processes (including \nsediment load and nutrient export) \n \nBarramundi and Banana prawns \n \nJan – Mar first wet season flow \n(provide for fisheries migration) \n \nWater harvesting developments \nwithout instream storages have \nbeen recommended \nOverbank \nflow (1 \nin 10 year \nflow \nevents) \nCapture of overbank flows by \ninstream storages and water \nharvesting  \n \nLoss of connectivity to floodplain \nFloodplain energy subsidy to \nriverine food webs, Floodplain \nwetlands, Floodplain vegetation \nThe impacts to overbank flows \nwere not able to be mitigated \nunder the Greenhills and Dagworth \nDam scenario, but are able to be \nmitigated under water harvesting \ndevelopment scenarios \n \n Sustainable irrigation development  \nEstablished irrigation development schemes in river basins or catchments have often followed a similar \ntrajectory of utilization of available resources leading to water scarcity and a shift in management focus \ntowards managing demand to fit the available supply and redressing environmental and social damage \nfrom overexploitation (Lorenzen et al., 2006). Reflecting the troubled history of irrigation development in \nsouthern Australia, and globally (including tropical regions), calls for water resource development and \nexpansion of agriculture in Northern Australia and the Gilbert River catchment are accompanied by pleas \nfor any development to be sustainable (Petheram et al., 2013, Barber, 2018, Waltham et al., 2013, \nCrossman and Bark, 2013). Camkin et al. (2008) notes community expectations are now that developments \nwill have acceptable environmental impacts as well as deliver social and economic benefits to the \ncommunity. The authors argue that there is ‘a unique and historic opportunity to ensure that management \nof Australia’s northern water resources takes place within a strategic, ecologically, culturally and \neconomically sustainable framework’.  \n \nThis subsection introduces the underpinnings and principles of sustainable development. Drawing on \nliterature both a developed and developing country perspective, an overview is then provided of \nframeworks and processes to support research into sustainable agricultural or water resource \ndevelopment in northern Australia. \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n88 \nSustainable development \nSustainable development – comprised of economic development, environmental protection, and social \ndevelopment – ensures the needs of both present and future generations are met (McConville and \nMihelcic, 2007). The intent is on development for common interest (society not individuals) now and into \nfuture (Plantey, 1999, McConville and Mihelcic, 2007), with an emphases on equity and transparency \n(Plantey, 1999), and an inclusive and integrated approach to the design, implementation and monitoring of \nprojects (Camkin et al., 2008). Camkin et al. (2008) note that the success of development for irrigation in \nnorther Australia “will require transparency and accountability to local communities, ongoing monitoring \nand early identification of emerging problems, and funding to deal with unexpected problems that \ninvariably occur well after development”. This emphasis on community is also noted by McConville and \nMihelcic (2007) who conceptualise the social development dimension of sustainable development as being \ncomprised of sociocultural respect, community participation, and political cohesion. \nThe above definition of sustainable development is consistent with the Gulf Water (2007) Plan \nrequirement for social, economic and ecological outcomes from water development and use. The \nEtheridge Shire Council, similarly has expressed the importance of proceeding with caution and \ndeliberation to build local community support to grow the GRAP sustainably. As mentioned in Section \n5.1.3, local participants at the Gilbert River Agricultural Forum, expressed the desire that future \nagricultural development would retain the character of the catchment and support local development and \njobs. With concern about the impacts of water development and extractions on the environment (Section \n5.5.3), and the uncertainty around the impact of extractions from river bed sands on hyporheic zone and \nGDE, there is a clear need for integrative and reflective approaches that will support research and practice \ntoward sustainable development in the Gilbert River catchment. The strong Indigenous history in the \nregion should also be considered when evaluating developments, with participation from Indigenous \ngroups (Petheram et al., 2013).  \n \nImpact assessment process of new water infrastructure for irrigation or flood mitigation \nImpact assessment is an essential component of construction projects although the approach for impact \nassessment can vary considerably depending on the nature and scale of a project. In developing a checklist \nfor assessing sustainability performance of construction projects, (Shen et al., 2007) take a project life cycle \napproach that outlines economic, environmental and social sustainability factors to consider against the \ninception, design, construction, operation and demolition phases of a project; some examples of factors \nincluded in their checklist are given in Table 26. For irrigation development and flood mitigation projects \ndesigned to positively impact regional communities and economies, a process that integrates across \nbiophysical, social and economic dimensions, and which engages with communities and stakeholders is \nneeded. \nIn an International Water Management Institute (IWMI) guidance manual on management of impacts of \nirrigation development on fisheries, Lorenzen et al. (2006) outlined an iterative process for impact \nassessment (Figure 71). This process can be generalised to other ecological (e.g. wetlands or waterholes), \neconomic or sociocultural impacts. Important characteristics are that major stakeholders and community \nare represented and participate in the process, and that the process is flexible and responsive with due \nconsideration given to monitoring and adaptive management. This allow the identification of specific \napproaches and methods in response to local priorities, capacity and knowledge and supports the effective \nintegration and use of both local and scientific knowledge (Lorenzen et al., 2006). \n \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n89 \nTable 26 Life cycle approach to assess the sustainability of construction projects (Shen et al., 2007) \nSustainability \ndimension \nFactors to be assessed \nInception phase \nEconomic Supply and demand, marketing forecast, scale and business scope, effects on local economy, life cycle profit \nanalysis, capital budget, finance plan, investment plan \nSocial Land use, conservation of cultural and natural heritage, employment, infrastructure capacity-building, \ncommunity amenities, safety assessment \nEnvironment Eco-environmental sensitivity, ecological impacts, air, water, noise, waste \nDesign phase \nEconomic Consideration of life cycle cost, project layout, materials choice \nSocial Safety design, security consideration \nEnvironment Energy savings and environmental issues, life cycle design, environmentally conscious design, modular and \nstandardised design \n \n \n \nFigure 71 Assessment process for impacts of irrigation on fisheries (Lorenzen et al., 2006). \n \nRecent developments in research or development innovations \nResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI): RRI has gained attention over the last decade to guide \n‘socially and ethically acceptable innovation’ that aims to anticipate the implications of innovations and \nproactively respond to societal concerns (Eastwood et al., 2019). It can be conceptualised in the \nanticipation-inclusion-reflexivity-responsiveness (AIRR) framework (Figure 72). The approach has been \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n90 \nused in relation to emerging technologies where a broad range of public concerns can exist and there is an \n‘institutional void’. In these situations, collective stewardship of science and innovation is needed into \nensure good outcomes in the future.  Stilgoe et al. (2013) define RRI as “a transparent, interactive process \nby which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the \n(ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable \nproducts (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society).” \n \nTransitions research and management: transition research investigates the establishment of sustainable \nregimes through tracking how incumbent regimes are disrupted and replaced over time (Smith and Stirling, \n2010). Transition management embeds this perspective within an iterative, four-stage cyclical governance \nframework (Table 27).  \n \nTable 27 Governance framework for transition management \nStage Characteristics \nProblem \nstructuring and \ngoal envisioning \n- multi stakeholder, but usually overseen by government  \n- development of a shared vision for sustainability and how to reach these goals  \n- sustainability goals  practical visions VIA scenario-building techniques    \n- visions shape subsequent activities \nTransition \npathways and \nexperiments \n- participants identify pathways towards visions  \n- pathways influence the development of niche experiments  \n- multiple niches created/tested  \n- niche pre-development  take-off/acceleration  more sustainable regime  \nLearning and \nadaptation \n- highlight links between long-term goals and the short-term actions in niche experiments  \n- niche experiments improve understanding of institutional constraints and opportunities, not just \ninstrumental outcomes  \nInstitutionalization - point at which serious commitments are needed  \n- redirect institutional, economic and political commitments into promising niches + desired pathways  \n \nAnticipatory governance: Guston (2014) defines anticipatory governance as ‘a broad-based capacity \nextended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based \ntechnologies while such management is still possible’. The motivation behind the approach is to build \ncapacities in foresight, engagement, and integration (Table 28) that support the reflection of scientists, \nengineers, policy makers, and others on their roles in new technologies. As in RRI, reflection means \nawareness of one’s own position as participant, with a specific set of roles and responsibilities, in a field of \nother actors (Guston, 2014). \n \nPrecautionary principle for technology policy: Stirling (2007) notes that it is not possible to ‘concurrently \npursue all possible viable technological directions and so taking any one path will likely open up some \nchoices whilst closing others down. In the context of technology policy, Stirling considers the precautionary \nprinciple to provide a ‘guide to the social processes through which robust decisions may be formed’ and \ngiving greater ‘attention to a broader range of issues, complexities, uncertainties, possibilities, options, \nbenefits, knowledges, strategic qualities, values and perspectives’ related to an innovation. That is, \n“precaution properly amounts to is the adoption of more rigorous, complete and inclusive processes for \nthe deliberate social appraisal of contending technological choices”. Whilst such processes may increase \nlegitimacy in the final stages of technology choice, Stirling (2007) argues that stakeholder deliberation and \ncitizen participation is essential for the initial ‘framing’ of procedures for scientific and technical \nassessment. \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n91 \n \nFigure 72 Conceptualisation of RRI in the anticipation-inclusion-reflexivity-responsiveness (AIRR) framework.

There is no magic bullet to improving water access and management in the \ncatchment and there is much uncertainty in demonstrating effectiveness and return on investment. There \nis also a need to convincingly address environmental risk to ease existing rules and build the social license \nthat is key to successful transformative change.  \nDespite the absence of perfect & complete information, there are ways forward to explore water \ninnovations that would support sustainable water resource developments and associated irrigation \nprecincts. We propose an active management paradigm that aims to  \n• Learn by doing to build understanding together over time \n• Demonstrate understanding and continued stewardship of the water resource \n• Avoid lock-in, but provide transparency and vision to attract investment \nActive management of water resources would examine the potential for incremental change from existing \nuse and explore the multiple possible options (and their combination). As development is constrained by \nconcerns about risks, an active management approach would place high value of new information around \nthe optimisation and impacts of existing pumping from the river bed sands, better articulating water needs \nand opportunities in the GRAP, and better identifying risks (and ways to mitigate them) that would support \nthe relaxation of regulation that currently prohibits the use of new spear bore licences other than at high \nflows. The action-state-consequence framework outlined in Section 5.3.7 could form the basis of \nidentification, assessment and mitigation of risks associated with incremental development of water \nresources in the catchment (be it MAR or surface water schemes). \n \n5.6 Social acceptability \nIn Section 5.6.1, the key findings of previous engagement with community in the Gilbert catchment as part \nof the CSIRO FGARA project around surface water management and the DBC for the Gilbert River Irrigation \nProject (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). An overview of the engagement undertaken for this MAR \nfeasibility projects follows in Section 5.6.2. \n \n Previous stakeholder engagement in the region \nDetailed Base Case for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project \nAs part of the DBC for the Gilbert River Irrigation Project prepared by Jacobs Australia Pty Limited. (2020) \nstakeholder engagement was undertaken. Stakeholders included potential customers, impacted \nlandholders, traditional owners and government. Stakeholder engagement was conducted through \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n93 \nmeetings in person, workshops, presentation, phone call and written communication. Engagement begun \nin 2017 and continued through to December 2019.  \nThe proposed development, including the dam, has strong support from the local council, Etheridge Shire \nCouncil. Their hope is that such a development will support the growth of both population and industry in \nthe region, bringing economic benefits.86 After initial information sessions landowners who would be \nimpacted and/or benefit from the dam endorsed the continuation of the project into the DBC phase and \nexhibited a desire to participate (Jacobs Australia Pty Limited., 2020). \nJacobs Australia Pty Limited. (2020)  reported a mixed response from farmers and landholders to the \nproposed dam. Some people expressed demand for increased water availability and economic stimulus, \nwhile others were not interested in pursuing irrigated agriculture and/or were not going to benefit from \nthe construction of the dam (as they were not part of the proposed irrigation area). Many landowners \nwanted to see a robust, fact-based, independent assessment that addressed social, economic and \nenvironmental aspects. As part of the DBC, an expression of interest was undertaken with stakeholders to \ngauge demand, based on the pricing outlined in Section 5.4.3. Based on this assessment likely water \ndemand from local landholders and external investors was 79,000 ML and 58,000 ML, respectively.  \nThe traditional owners of the land, the Ewamian and Tagalaka People were consulted and oversaw the \ngeotechnical site investigations undertaken as part of the DBC. Their key concerns were that the proposed \nproject, would enact proper management of cultural impacts and would provide employment \nopportunities to First Nations peoples. \n       \nFlinders and Gilbert Agricultural Resource Assessment \nPast studies documenting attitudes to kinds of water development in the region summarised a general \ntrend from most to least favourable as (Petheram et al., 2013): \n1. Smaller, offstream storages supplied by flood harvesting  \n2. Groundwater extraction (e.g., from bores)  \n3. Small instream dams in tributaries that do not restrict all of the flow  \n4. Large instream dams in major rivers  \nThe relatively positive attitudes to groundwater suggest MAR may be well received (although MAR was not \nspecifically considered in the FGARA study).  \n \n Case study engagement for the MAR feasibility project \nPreliminary phone interviews \nSix phone interviews were conducted with local cotton growers [CG1, CG2] and external researchers [R1, \nR2] or government employees [QG1, QG2] with experience in the Gilbert River catchment between January \n2019 to March 2019. Information from these interviews (and interviews from other candidate catchments) \nwere used in selection of the project case studies and scoping the focus area (the Gilbert River above \nStrathmore, the GRAP) and target aquifer (the bed sands) of the Gilbert case study.  \nThe interviews indicated that there is considerable interest in cotton production with farmers in the Gilbert \ncatchment, with support provided through promising trials with DAF and other researchers on some farms \nin the catchment. Although the primary agricultural industry in the area is beef cattle, broadacre cropping \nis recognised as a growth opportunity in the catchment [QG2], subject to the constraints posed by ‘patchy’ \nsoil suitability [R1], mosaics of irrigation suitability due to slope [CG2] and native vegetation clearing \n                                                       \n86 That said, the new council has deliberately stepped back from promoting only the dam and is taking a broader perspective of \nagricultural and water resource development in order to ‘bring the community into the conversation’ (see Section 5.1.3) \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n94 \nregulations [CG2]. One of the cotton growers had been growing dryland cotton for four years and at the \ntime of interview was trialling some irrigation for the first time to ‘finish off’ their 4,500 ha planting [CG1]. \ntheir interest in cotton production was only increasing over time with promising yields and receiving a \n‘colour bonus’ due to the whiteness of the harvested cotton. The other grower interviewed was producing \ncotton and guar, with the Queensland DAF conducting cotton irrigation trials on their property [CG2]. \nCotton was desirable to them as it was not much impacted by pests, other than a little nibbling by \nwallabies. [CG2] aimed to get 10 bales/ha like they do down south, an increase from their current (as of \n2019) dryland yields are 4 to 7 bales/ha (with small patches of 10 bales/ha noted while harvesting). The \nmonsoonal rains are used to grow the crop but [CG1] noted that it would be good to have more water to \nfinish off their cotton crop in July (an additional 1-2 ML was needed).  \nThe interviewees noted the flashy nature of rainfall that, while it could be unreliable, provided plenty of \nflooding and an opportunity if that water could be stored [QG1, QG2, CG1]. Groundwater use in the area is \nfrom about 10-15m depth but these are mainly wind mills and solar bores for stock and domestic water \n[CG1]. Storing water is a critical constraint at present. On-farm dams will not be possible across much of \nthe arable land as the soil is ‘too light’ for the construction of infrastructure such as ‘ring tanks’, although \nthe proposed Greenhills dam would offer great potential for surface water storage in the region [CG2]. The \nDBC for this dam has been conducted but an EIS has not yet commenced and so in the short-term storage \noptions will remain constrained. \nGiven the constraints to surface water storage, the idea of MAR held some promise to interviewees albeit \nthey noted some challenges that would need to be overcome. MAR was not expected to be an approach \nthat would work on a broad scale across the catchment but might work in particular locations [QG1, R1, \nR2]. [R2] noted there is limited hydrogeological information in the Gilbert region but felt that the basalts \nand GAB were not likely to support a MAR-based irrigation scheme. While the basalts had some high \nrecharge areas, these were located far away from the best irrigation areas and so the costs of moving the \nwater to the irrigation area would be problematic [R2]. The GAB is a mostly confined aquifer that underlies \nthe alluvium and following rainfall at the recharge sites, [R2] said that the pressure can create baseflow \ninto the river and ‘reject recharge’ into the GAB. The recharge zones tend to be in high rocky outcrops and \nare not suited to irrigated agriculture, and the depth to the GAB (in the Gilbert Formation) can drop to 100-\n200m below the surface within only 10’s of km from the recharge zones [R2].  \nThe bed sands were identified as potentially viable option for MAR [QG1, R2]. Both cotton growers \ninterviewed currently pump from ‘surface water’ sources directly from the alluvial river bed. If the spear \nbores of [CG2] are running properly, then they think they can extract 30L/s (2.6 ML/day) from their license \nthat allows up to 20 ML/day. Their water licenses allow them access to a lot of water early in the season \nbut it peters out into the dry season (following the availability of surface water). This is when they need the \nwater to boost cotton crops at the end of the wet season [CG2]. This ‘tapping’ out of the bed sands was \nnoted by [QG1] who thought there might be “say 20 days of flow which is stored in on-farm storage in the \nsandy river bed”. MAR targeting the bed sand might extend this ‘storage capacity’. However, the Gilbert \nalluvium is also ‘gaining’ connected to the stream in places so any MAR scheme would also need to know \nthat the groundwater can be extracted before it is ‘lost’ downstream as streamflow [R2]. \nBeyond the issue of water availability at the time of finishing cotton crops, the interviews highlighted the \nneed for a local cotton gin to ensure the financial viability of a cotton industry in the Gilbert catchment. \nCurrently, cotton harvests are trucked to the Gin in Emerald and the costs to transport impact financial \nviability [QG1], comprising between 20% and 25% of [CG1] production costs. CG2 is about 1000 km \nEmerald and noted that transporting/ cotton to Emerald to the gin was viable if cotton is collecting $450 - \n$500/bale. Researchers with experience in the regions [R1, R2] were unsure as to whether there was \nsufficient interest and available water to grow the area of cotton needed to support a local gin. [R2] also \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n95 \nexpressed doubt that enough cotton could be produced using water from the alluvium to support a gin. \n[R2]. \n  \nTargeted case study engagement  \nUnlike the Coleambally case study, there are low numbers of landholders growing agricultural or \nhorticultural crops in the Gilbert River catchment. This, along with recognition of the uncertainty in the \nnature and feasibility of MAR, meant that no further phone interviews were conducted with local \nlandholders. Instead we conducted targeted engagement (summarised in Table 29) with researchers, \ngovernment employees, local council and NRM agencies to inform the pre-feasibility assessment in this \nsection, and test and revise MAR scenarios in Section 4. Engagement was focused on aspects around \naspects of agronomic considerations (Section 5.3.2), the interest in MAR targeting the river bed sands (this \nsubsection), and associated technical feasibility (Section 5.3), environmental risks (Section 5.5) and \ngovernance implications (see Section 5.7).  \n \nTable 29 Summary of targeted engagement to support the pre-feasibility assessment and development of MAR and alternative scenarios \nInstitution Purpose of engagement Discussion highlights \nCSIRO \n(agronomist) \n• Gain understanding of opportunities and \nchallenges of agricultural production in \nnorthern Queensland \n• Identify agronomic considerations to include \nMAR pre-feasibility assessment \n• Discuss strategies to overcome low aquifer \nyields \n• Outcome of this discussion (and following \nSteering Committee meeting) focused our \nattention on MAR targeting the river bed sands \n• Highlighted the need to consider cotton as part \nof the cropping system   \n• A critical constraint to agricultural development \nis the availability of cleared land with suitable \nsoils (getting permission to clear land is now \ndifficult) \nESC • Test the potential MAR scenarios and their \nsurface water alternatives \n• Understand the perspective of current Council \non development of water infrastructure and \nagriculture industry \n• Gained an update on the proposed Greenhills \ndam post-DBC (see Section 5.1.3) \n• Open to the idea of MAR as a storage option \n• Stressed the need for the community to be \nbrought along in any investment in water \ndevelopment in the GRAP  \nGSNRM • Understand the role the GSNRM play in land \nand water stewardship in the Gilbert catchment \n• Test the potential MAR scenarios and their \nsurface water alternatives \n• Seek input on the development of ANU \ninteractive session for the Gilbert River \nAgricultural Forum  \n• Gut feel that sorghum would be more \nattractive (than cotton) to farmers in the region \nas it is a fodder crop \n• Exploring MAR in the river bed sands opens up \nthe debate around water management (beyond \nsole focus on a big dam) \n• Understanding attitudes of local graziers and \nfarmers will be key to water development in \nthe region \n• Will be critical to develop governance capacity \nand social licence and to address \nenvironmental risks  \nRDMW • Check our understanding of the Gulf Water \n(2007) Plan \n• Explore the governance issues around MAR \ntargeting the Gilbert River bed sands \n• Clarified the flow conditions around extraction \nof water from the bed sands in the Gilbert river \nzones (see Sections \n5.2.1 and 5.7.1) \n• Link to historical documents used in the \ndevelopment and amendment of the Gulf \nWater Plan and ROP 87  \n \n                                                       \n87 Search - DES, DoR and DRDMW - Liberty (softlinkhosting.com.au), accessed 22 June 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n96 \nDiscussions with CSIRO, ESC and GSNRM confirmed that MAR had not been considered in previous water \nresource assessments. Although acknowledging the uncertainty around technical feasibility and \nenvironmental risks, the potential scalability of MAR schemes targeting the river bed sands was seen as \npotential advantage. Water storage is a key issue in the monsoonal Gilbert River system, where substantial \nvolumes of water are typically available in the wet, but is of greater value in the dry. While large in-stream \ndams have historically been a preferred storage solution, more recent focus on full cost recovery and \nenvironmental impact has meant that, particularly in remote regions such as northern Australia, \ninvestment in large dams is dependent on political action or intervention from large corporate entities. \nMAR targeting the river bed was seen as a possible storage solution that could support incremental and \nsustainable development of irrigated cropping in the catchment.  \n \nGilbert River Agricultural Forum (7-8 April 2021) \nOn 7-8 April 2021, the Etheridge Shire Council hosted the Gilbert River Agricultural Forum, with the main \nobjective being to explore opportunities for economic diversification in the region. Whilst the Council \nrecognises that the mainstay of the region is grazing, they believe that the “introduction of a horticulture \nand rotational cropping industry in conjunction with additional water allocations will ensure the long term \nexpanded future of the Shire” \n88.  Primary producers and key stakeholders were invited to attend the forum \nworkshop on 7 April to hear from other producers, industry groups and researchers on a range of topics \nincluding Leucena production within grazing enterprises, cotton production, horticulture, researcher \ncropping trials, the North Queensland cotton gin feasibility study, and horticulture opportunities. On the \nfollowing day, participants visited cropping trial sites, table grapes operations and a mango plantation to \nlearn about these operations and the opportunities and challenges for expansion of cropping in the \ncatchment.  \nAs part of the Forum activities on April 7, we presented an overview of the MAR Feasibility project and our \nGilbert River case study followed by a truncated interactive session that aimed to have participants reflect \non local experiences with agricultural production and visions for future agricultural industry in the \ncatchment and to explore what information is needed to build capacity and confidence to invest in water \nmanagement and irrigation over time. The planned session was reduced from 1.5 hours to 45 minutes due \nto extended discussions in earlier sessions. \nVisions of future agriculture industry: as an ice-breaker, forum participants broke into groups and \nbrainstormed their vision for agriculture in the Gilbert River catchment and were asked to identify what \ncharacteristics the industry would have (e.g. enterprise mix, outcomes for communities, associated \nindustries and services, etc). The discussions within the group highlighted the need for considered \ndevelopment of agriculture in the region to ensure that (a) the character of the region was retained \n(reflecting the strong pastoral identity of the catchment population) and (b) local economic and social \noutcomes were delivered (Table 30).  \nWater and information needs required to support agriculture: in the same groups, participants explored \nthe following questions: \n• Where is water needed now and in the future? \n• What information is needed to change how water is used and managed? Who might be involved? \nHow and why? \nWater is mostly needed to extend the growing season through May and June but may also be needed \nsome years in January to establish crops and hay. Multiple sources of water were seen to be useful, namely \nfrom the river, bed sands licenses and off stream sources.  \n                                                       \n88 https://www.etheridge.qld.gov.au/gilbert-river-agricultural-forum-1/gilbert-river-agricultural-forum, accessed 23 June 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n97 \nThere is a need for greater awareness of where landholders can go for information about what water is \ncurrently available, whether it can be used and how it can be stored. Some aspects raised one group were \naround the possibilities to access water from both sides of the river, and the need for clear advice on \nwhether landholders were able to access water from overland flow into current farm dams. Information on \nthe latter is publicly available (see Section 5.7.1) but was not known by the group. The group thought that \nstakeholders, landholders, and community all needed to be involved in building knowledge and capacity \naround water availability and use in the catchment, but that there was a need for leader or advisor who \nindividuals can ask questions of. Any development of water infrastructure such as the proposed Greenhills \nDam, or regional-scale MAR, aimed at supporting agricultural expansion would need involvement of local \ngovernment, community, and outside expertise to enhance positive and mitigate detrimental \nconsequences of development on the environment, downstream industries, and social outcomes for \ncommunity. \nTable 30 Visions of future agriculture in the Gilbert catchment and requirements needed to progress towards this vision.  \n Vision Requirements \nGroup 1 Agricultural development that \n(a) provides stable employment \nopportunities and services to \nthe local community, (b) sees \ncollaboration across \ngovernment, investors and \nlocals, and (c) retains the \ncharacter of the region. \n• Strategic agricultural growth or change that retains the character of the \nregion, employs local people and delivers on services to the town(s) and \ncommunity  \n• Strategic workforce development on-ground and pre-development \n• Current and future situational analysis that identifies the skilled/12-month \njobs for locals (versus seasonal workforce options) \n• Collaboration and agreement across all levels of government \n• Long term strategy around agronomy / science (investors versus locals) \n• Outcomes delivered for town services (roads, schools, social, welfare, \nmedical, etc) \nGroup 2 A vibrant, sustainable economic \nzone which positively impacts \nthe economy and local \ncommunities and employment \n• Strategy for utilisation of overland flows to deliver dryland and livestock \nactivities with intensive irrigated cropping that supports the vision (e.g. \nFarmers capturing and using overland flows using small dams) \n• Innovative agricultural systems \n• Skilled workforce \nGroup 3 An industry that encompasses \nviable traditional agriculture \n(grazing) and supports \ninnovation into cropping and \nfarming. The regions $/ML of \nwater used will be maximised \nwith grazing remaining the \nmajor land user with high value \nagriculture [located] where \nresources exist. \n• Start small / slow development / scaleable development  \n• Support existing industries [as well as emerging ones] \n• Improved physical and natural capital: Farming infrastructure, access to \nwater [when needed] \n• Improved human capital: capacity building around agricultural production \nand irrigation access and management \n• Regional outcomes: public facilities, sundry industries, improved road \nnetworks \n• Supportive land tenure (e.g. ability to subdivide) and land clearing \narrangements \n \nAnother group specifically considered the information needs around the bed sands. They highlighted the \nlimited understanding the bed sands system and the need for monitoring of the bed sands. This includes \nthe physical dimensions and capacity of the system (e.g. bed sands depth) and the movement and \navailability of water within the system. One person thought that more water was pumped from the bed \nsands 20 years ago than now and that bed sands license use was now minimal; the reason for this change \nwas not known. \nField visits: spear bores extracting water from the bed sands were being used to irrigate at three of the \nfield visit properties. Research trial plots of cotton, mung beans and other crops were being supplied by \nfurrow irrigation on one property, whilst drip irrigation was used on a table grape trial and an established \nmango orchard on other properties. Landholders or managers using these bores (on the field visit \nproperties or elsewhere) noted the variation in water availability over time and space. Some bores from \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n98 \nzones 3-5 (where entitlements have no attached flow conditions) showed little change in pumping rates \nover time whilst others typically run into water shortages as the dry season progresses. Anecdotally, the \nconcept of MAR targeting the bed sands was of interest to some local landholders, Council and external \nindividuals. However, local interest in on-farm storage and capture of overland flows was also expressed by \nsome attending the field trip. \n \n5.7 Governance arrangements \nThis section addresses the governance arrangements that would relate to any proposed MAR scheme \ntargeting river bed sands. Although there is the opportunity to purchase new water entitlements in the \nGilbert catchment (Section 5.2, Table 31), there is no MAR specific policy in Queensland (Section 5.7.1) and \nthe flow conditions outlined in the current surface water policy limits MAR schemes that would target river \nbed sands in the Gilbert region (Section 5.2.2). There is additional policies and approvals that MAR, water \ninfrastructure and any other development would be subject to (Section 5.7.3). The governance \narrangements for the one agricultural MAR scheme in Queensland – the Burdekin River region is – outlined \nin Section 0. The section concludes with a discussion on how current water policy could shift to an \napproach based on rules and Resource Condition Limits (RCL; Section 0). \n \n Water Policy in the Gilbert Catchment \nWater plans are prepared under the Water Act 2000. Water policy in the Gilbert (and surrounding \ncatchments) fall under two plans depending on the location of the water: \n• Groundwater in a GAB or other regional aquifer is managed under the Water Plan (Great Artesian \nBasin and Other Regional Aquifers) 2017 89 \n• Surface water (water in a watercourse is managed under the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 90. Surface \nwater includes water in a watercourse or lake, water in non-GAB connected springs and overland \nflow 91. Surface water also includes hydraulically connected groundwater in an aquifer under a \nprescribed watercourse or under land within 1km of a prescribed watercourse 92. The Gilbert River \nis a prescribed watercourse 93.   \nUnderground water that is not GAB water but is in the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 plan area is managed under \nthe Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 94. As this research is focused on the bed sands of the Gilbert River, and not the \ndeeper aquifers of the GAB, the focus policy document is the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007.  \n \nWater Plan (Gulf) 2007 \nThe Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 (here-on-in referred as the Plan) and the Gulf Resource Operations Plan 95 (the \nGulf ROP) work collectively to outline and manage water in the Gulf area. Sections that relevant to the \nGilbert catchment, irrigated agriculture and/or MAR are highlighted in the following text.  \n                                                       \n89 https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2017-0164, accessed 13 April 2021 \n90 https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2007-0268, accessed 13 April 2021  \n91 s 11 Water to which plan applies in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n92 s 8 Declaration about watercourse—Act, s 1006(2) in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n93 s 8 Declaration about watercourse—Act, s 1006(2) in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n94 s 11 Water to which plan applies in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n95 https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/293927/gulf-rop-amendment-august-2015.pdf, accessed 28 \nApril 2021 \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n99 \nUnallocated water held under various reserves (Indigenous, strategic and general) are outlined in the Plan \n96, as was summarised in Section 5.2.2. Any new general reserve entitlements in the Gilbert Catchment are \nrequired to include at least one pass flow condition 97. This condition is seen in the fixed price terms of \nrelease in the catchment (see Table 10) 98. This condition effectively stops any new allocations from the \nbed sands that would replicate the current bed sand licences. This is confirmed in the 2018 Minister’s \nPerformance Assessment Report Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 (DNRME, 2018a): ‘No new entitlements can be \ngranted from the within bed sands zones from general reserve unallocated water.’ 99. Without policy \nchange this limits the feasibility of MAR from bed sands in the catchment as new entitlements under low \nflow/cease to flow conditions are prohibited.    \nThe Plan details ecological outcomes, including ‘maintenance of water in the bed sands of the Gilbert River \nbetween AMTD 317km and AMTD 263km’ 100. This area comprises of Zones 3 – 5 (see Figure 19), coinciding \nwith the GRAP. The actively used bed sand allocations are located in this stretch of the river. The stated \npurpose of maintaining water in the bed sands are to support riparian vegetation, provide habitat during \nthe dry season and contribute to flows in the Gilbert River 101. Another ecological outcome of the Plan is \nthe provision of suitable habitat for banana prawn development via the maintenance of flow in the Gilbert \nRiver 102. Discussion of the prawn industry in the Gilbert can be found in Section 5.5.1.    \nThe intended economic outcomes of the Plan are to support the growth of irrigated agriculture in the \nGilbert River catchment area by making water available 103; this is demonstrated by the unallocated water \nreleases that are available in the Gilbert River (Table 10). To assign unallocated water for an irrigation \nwater licence, the potential land suitability must be demonstrated 104 and the ecological and cultural \nsustainability of the proposed irrigation development must be shown 105.     \n \nOverland Flow: As well as the general unallocated water available from the watercourse in the Gilbert \ncatchment (Section 5.2.2), there is also the ability to take overland flow under the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n106. Overland flow can be taken for stock and domestic purposes, in works that allow the taking of overland \nflow and have a capacity of not more than 250 ML or under a water license, among other reasons 107. \n \nThe Gulf ROP: The Gulf ROP outlines any conditions and requirements relating to licences, both existing \nand future, and ensures that local conditions and downstream requirements are considered when taking \nwater (CSIRO, 2009). This document also outlines when changes are made to the Plan, for example, the \n                                                       \n96 Schedule 6A Total volumes for indigenous unallocated water, Schedule 7 Total volumes for strategic unallocated water and \nSchedule 8 Total volumes for general unallocated water in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n97 s 39A Condition for general unallocated water in Flinders and Gilbert River catchments in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n98 https://www.rdmw.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1486600/gulf-water-release-terms.pdf, accessed 29 November \n2021 \n99 Table 5 in Minister’s Performance Assessment Report Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 May 2018 \n100 s 15 Ecological outcomes in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n101 s 15 Ecological outcomes in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n102 s 15 Ecological outcomes in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n103 s 13 Economic outcomes in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n104 s 31 Requirement for information about land suitability in Gulf Resource Operations Plan June 2010 Amendment August \n2015 \n105 s 31 Requirement for information about land suitability in Gulf Resource Operations Plan June 2010 Amendment August \n2015 \n106 s 78 Limitation on taking overland flow water—Act, s 20(2) in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n107 s 78 Limitation on taking overland flow water—Act, s 20(2) in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n100 \naddition of pass flow conditions on water entitlements granted from the general unallocated water reserve \nin the Gilbert River and Flinders catchment (Insertion of s39A in the Plan (Gulf)) 108.  \nThere were multiple assessments that were compiled to inform the first iteration of the Plan (then known \nas the Water Resource (Gulf) Plan 2007).  \n• Assessment of development options (DNRME, 2004): Identification of soils suitable for agricultural \nproduction informed the potential demand for water resources in the region. In this assessment, \nthis potential demand was compared with water availability to assess development options. In the \nGilbert catchment, the area between Prestwood and Chadshunt stations showed the greatest \npotential for irrigated agriculture; this is a very similar area to the GRAP (see Figure 15). As of 2004, \nthe remoteness and associated high transport costs were considered to compromise the economic \nviability of irrigated along the Gilbert River and the Gulf region generally.   \n• Considerations of hyporheic ecosystem: Two reports highlighted the possible environmental \nimportance of the bed sands of the Gilbert River as a hyporheic ecosystem (DNRME, 2006b, \nDNRME, 2006a). It was suggested that further use of the bed sands in the middle reaches of the \nGilbert River could adversely affect these ecosystems (DNRME, 2006b). This line of thinking would \nresult in no further entitlements from the bed sands, which is reflected in the current Plan (see \nSection 5.7.1). Other reports suggest that current bed sand allocations require critical reassessment \nand any extension of current use needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis (DNRME, 2006a). \nThis suggestion is based on the lack of information on the hyporheic zone beyond its existence and \nthat the impacts from current and historic extractions is yet to be assessed (DNRME, 2006a). \nMonitoring and management was advocated to accompany any development (DNRME, 2006b). \n• Community submissions on the draft Plan (DNRME, 2006d): Community submission(s) suggested \nthat the trading of existing bed sand entitlements be allowed (DNRME, 2006d), and this was \nincluded in subsequent Resource Operation Plans \n109. Community consultation was also considered \nwhen setting the initial unallocated general water reserves (DNRME, 2006d).  \nThese initial assessments all highlight the lack of data for the Gulf catchments (DNRME, 2006b, DNRME, \n2006a, DNRME, 2006d, DNRME, 2006c), and triggered a precautionary approach to water resource \ndevelopment and associated policy (DNRME, 2006a).  \nWater policy, and the provision of unallocated water released, has changed since the Plan was first \nreleased, following periodic reviews and updates based on new information. This is can be observed in \nTable 31, where unallocated general reserves were increased substantially based on the published findings \nfrom the FGARA reports 110. \nA continued knowledge gap is localised bed sand water levels in the Gilbert River alluvium (DNRME, \n2018b). Interactions of the bed sands area with GDEs is also undetermined (DNRME, 2018b). \nThe next major review of the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 is in 2027 111. \n \n                                                       \n108 https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/293932/gulf-rop-wrp-explanatory-notes.pdf, accessed 21 \nApril 2021 \n109 https://cabinet.qld.gov.au/documents/2009/Oct/Gulf%20Resource%20Op%20Plan/Attachments/gulf-rop.pdf, accessed 29 \nApril 2021 & https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/293927/gulf-rop-amendment-august-2015.pdf, \naccessed 21 April 2021 \n110 7 Unallocated water in Minister’s Performance Assessment Report Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 May 2018 \n111 Water Plan (Gulf) (Postponement of Expiry) Notice 2018, https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/asmade/sl-2018-0121, \naccessed 20 April 2021  \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n101 \nTable 31 Updates to unallocated water reserves and associated releases in the Gilbert catchment as per Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 and \naccompanying Gulf Resource Operations Plans.

The extent of the area covered under \nthis water plan is shown in Figure 73. A bore is needed to access groundwater in the GAB. New bores \nusually require development approval and must be located further than specified distance from existing \nbores in the area to limit any effect on those bores. Artesian bores also require a flow control mechanism. \nWater licences, issued for long-term activities, are separated into three types (Table 32). The majority \n(86%) of water licenses are stock and domestic licences. \nThe extent of the GAB area (Figure 73) is further broken into groundwater units and sub-areas, often \nassociated with a formation 121. The units that are associated with the Gilbert Catchment are shown in \nFigure 74. Current bores in the Gilbert Catchment are placed within multiple GAB formations (Figure 75). \nUnallocated water is available from many of the groundwater units and for many difference purposes 122; \nsuch water associated with units underlying the Gilbert catchment is outlined in Table 33. \nTo better position MAR as a viable water supply/management technique in Australia, policy detailing the \ndirect transfers of entitlements to recover recharged water is required (Ward and Dillon, 2012). How this \nwould look in situations when the target aquifer is fully allocated or overdrawn is not defined (Ward and \nDillon, 2012). To encourage MAR projects it has also been suggested that there needs to be secure and \nfinancially viable source water for recharge, both pre-establishment of MAR infrastructure and for the \nlifetime of the scheme (Ward-Noonan, 2021). Ward-Noonan (2021) suggested that this could be achieved \nthrough legislative reform. It is also important for MAR policy to outline how and from whom to obtain \nsource water rights depending on where the water is to be sourced (e.g., river, wastewater, stormwater) \n(Ward-Noonan, 2021). Another requirement for the approval of MAR schemes is capability building at the \ngovernment level, highlighting the potential of and increasing confidence in MAR (Dillon et al., 2020).  \n                                                       \n112 s 33 Unallocated water reserves in Gulf Resource Operations Plan June 2010 \n113 Appendix 4: Plan and instruments amendments in Minister’s Performance Assessment Report Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 May \n2018 \n114 Gulf draft amended plans Overview report (December 2014) \n115 7 Unallocated water in Minister’s Performance Assessment Report Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 May 2018 \n116 Schedule 8 Total volumes for general unallocated water in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n117 7 Unallocated water in Minister’s Performance Assessment Report Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 May 2018 \n118 39A Condition for general unallocated water in Flinders and Gilbert River catchments in Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 \n119 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, \naccessed 28 April 2021 \n120 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/water-plan-areas/great-\nartesian-basin/water-use-approval, accessed 12 April 2021 \n121 Schedule 2 Area of groundwater units and groundwater sub-areas in Water Plan (Great Artesian Basin and Other Regional \nAquifers) 2017 \n122 Schedule 4 Volume of unallocated water for water licences to be granted from reserves in Water Plan (Great Artesian Basin \nand Other Regional Aquifers) 2017 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n102 \n \nFigure 73 Water Plan (Great Artesian Basin and Other Regional Aquifers) 2017 Plan Area (from Schedule 1).  \nTable 32 Water licences to use water from the Great Artesian Basin (https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-\nwater/water/catchments-planning/great-artesian-basin/water-use-approval)  \nLicences Type Water Use/Water Uses Notes  \nStock and domestic  Stock and domestic purposes  Licences attach to specific land parcels and cannot be transferred to \nanother holder, except when properties are sold or subdivided. \nVolumetric water  Mines, businesses, local \ncouncils, feedlots and irrigators. \nLicences can be relocated, i.e., traded, either permanently or \nseasonally, subject to rules in the water management protocol. \nArea-based  Irrigators Specify the area of land that can be irrigated, rather than the \nvolume of water that can be used. \nNo longer being issued and cannot be traded. \n  \nA effective starting point for the development of state level MAR policy are the national guidelines (Dillon \net al., 2020); e.g., Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managing Health and Environmental Risks \n(Phase 2)–Managed Aquifer Recharge (NRMMC et al., 2009).

This has caused uncertainty \naround a MAR schemes entitlement to aquifer storage space and a schemes ownership over recharged \nwater once it enters the target aquifer (Ward and Dillon, 2012). The surface water recharged under a MAR \nscheme is often redefined as groundwater post-recharge and, therefore, subject to regulation in the same \nway as native groundwater (Ward and Dillon, 2012). \n \nTable 34 Queensland Acts and legislation applying to MAR (Source: Ward and Dillon, 2009) \n \ni) Water Act 2000 \nii) Water Availability and Entitlements Act 2008 \niii) South East Water Restructuring Act 2007 \niv) Native Title Act 1993 \nv) Integrated Planning Act 1997 \nvi) Public Health Act 2005 (Section 57) \nvii) Environmental Protection Act 1994 \nviii) Environmental Protection (Water) Policy 2000 \nix) Model Urban Stormwater Quality Management Plans and Guidelines (EPA 2007). \nx) Local Government Act 1993 \nxi) The Australian Guidelines for water recycling: managing health and environmental risks: Stormwater harvesting and reuse \n(EPHC Draft May 2008) \nxii) The Australian Guidelines for water recycling: managing health and environmental risks: Managed aquifer recharge \nNote: The draft Australian guidelines for water recycling have now been published (NRMMC et al., 2009) \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n108 \nThe Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge \nAn effective starting point for the development of state level MAR policy are the national guidelines (Dillon \net al., 2020): the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managing Health and Environmental Risks \n(Phase 2)–Managed Aquifer Recharge (NRMMC et al., 2009). States that adopted the guidelines into policy \nhave seen increases in MAR activity (Dillon et al., 2020). \nThe Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge (NRMMC et al., 2009) provide \nrecommendations to minimise the effect on water quality, human and environmental health as a result of \na new MAR project.  The guidelines detail entry-level assessments that should be undertaken to prior to a \nMAR project being undertaken, namely a viability assessment (Figure 76) and an assessment of the degree \nof difficulty associated with the project. How this report addresses the components of the viability \nassessment is outlined in Table 35.  \n \n \nFigure 76 A flowchart of the entry-level viability assessment (Source: NRMMC, EPHC & NHMRC, 2009). \n \nThe NSW Aquifer Interference Policy \nThe NSW Aquifer Interference Policy could be drawn upon to develop policy in Queensland. NSW does \nhave a specific Aquifer Interference Policy (AIP). While the focus of the policy is primarily on mining \nactivities, the policy specifically mentions injection works used to transmit water into an aquifer. It appears \nthat MAR through infiltration is not explicitly discussed in the policy (Box E). Approved aquifer interference \nactivities including MAR require an aquifer access licence and a groundwater use licence for a share of the \nconsumptive pool.  In water sources where water sharing plans do not yet apply, an aquifer interference \nactivity is required to hold a water licence under Part 5 of the Water Act 1912. \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n109 \nTable 35 Mapping the content of this report against the viability assessment components recommended by the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge entry-level viability \nassessment and this report (NRMMC, EPHC & NHMRC, 2009). \nAttribute from the \nGuidelines \nNotes from Guidelines Assessed in \nthis report \nComments \nIs there a sufficient \ndemand for water? \nThe ongoing volumetric demand for recovered water should be sufficient to warrant investment \nin the proposed project; if this is not the case, there needs to be a clearly defined environmental \nbenefit. Either one of these criteria is essential for managed aquifer recharge. Projects involving \nrecharge of partially treated water where recovery is incidental do not qualify as managed aquifer \nrecharge \nYes in 5.1.2 \nand 5.1.3 \n \nIs there an adequate \nsource of water \navailable for \nallocation to \nrecharge? \nEntitlement to water to be used for recharge needs to be secured. Mean annual volume of \nrecharge should exceed mean annual demand, with sufficient excess to build up a buffer storage \nto meet reliability and quality requirements. In an already over allocated catchment, an \nentitlement to surface water is unlikely to be available. \nYes in 5.2.1 \nto 5.2.5  \n \nIs there a suitable \naquifer for storage \nand recovery of the \nrequired volume? \nPresence of a suitable aquifer is critical for managed aquifer recharge. Such an aquifer needs to \nhave an adequate rate of recharge and sufficient storage capacity; it also needs to be capable of \nretaining the water where it can be recovered. Low salinity and marginally brackish aquifers are \npreferred, to maximise the volume of recovered water that is fit for use after fresh recharge water \nmixes with ambient groundwater. Regional maps showing the potential of aquifers as storages for \nmanaged aquifer recharge have been developed for some urban and rural areas, and are available \nfrom water resources managers in the local jurisdiction. In over allocated aquifers, water \nmanagers may have additional constraints on the proportion of recharge that may be recovered. \nYes in 5.3.2 \nand 5.3.3 \n \nIs there sufficient \nspace available for \ncapture and \ntreatment of the \nwater? \nFor stormwater recharge systems (either open space or dams), wetlands, ponds or basins are \nneeded to detain sufficient water to achieve the target volume of recharge. Similarly, space needs \nto be available for whatever treatment process, if any, is subsequently determined to be required. \nFor recycled water from a sewage treatment plant, generally no additional detention storage will \nbe required at the recharge facility. \nYes in 5.3.1 \nand 5.3.5 \n \nIs there a capability \nto design, construct \nand operate a MAR \nproject? \nKnowledge of hydrogeology and water-quality management is vital for the successful design, \nconstruction and operation of managed aquifer recharge projects. Also necessary for some \nprojects are geotechnical know-how, and expertise in water storage and treatment design, water \nsensitive urban design, hydrology, monitoring and reporting. Proponents who do not have these \nskills are encouraged to gain access to them before proceeding with Stage 2 investigations. The \nnumber of consultants experienced in investigations and design of managed aquifer recharge \nprojects is growing.  \n Development of capacity and skills is a key \ncomponent of the proposed scenarios, as is \nthe incremental development of local and \nsubregional hydrogeology and groundwater \nresponse to recharge. Expertise from across \nAustralia would need to be accessed and \nleveraged with the aim of building local \nexpertise.  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n110 \nTable 36 The Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling: Managed Aquifer Recharge entry-level degree of difficulty assessment: attributes to \nconsider. \nAttribute from the guidelines \nDoes source water meet the water-quality requirements for the environmental value of ambient groundwater? \nDoes source water meet the water-quality requirements for the environmental values of the intended end uses of the water \non recovery? \nDoes source water have low quality; for example: total suspended solids >10 mg/L, total organic carbon >10 mg/L, total \nnitrogen >10 mg/L? Also, is the soil or aquifer free of macropores? \nDoes ambient groundwater meet the water- quality requirements for the environmental values of intended end uses of water \non recovery? \nIs either drinking water supply, or protection of aquatic ecosystems with high conservation or ecological values, an \nenvironmental value of the target aquifer? \nDoes the salinity of native groundwater exceed either of the following: (a) 10 000 mg/L, (b) the salinity criterion for uses of \nrecovered water? \nIs redox status, pH, temperature, nutrient status and ionic strength of groundwater similar to that of source water? \nAre there other groundwater users, groundwater-connected ecosystems or a property boundary within 100–1000 m of the \nMAR site? \nIs the aquifer: (a) confined and not artesian?, (b) unconfined, with a water table deeper than 4 m in rural areas or 8 m in \nurban areas? \nIs the aquifer unconfined, with an intended use of recovered water that includes drinking water supplies? \nIs the aquifer composed of fractured rock or karstic media, or known to contain reactive minerals? \nHas another project in the same aquifer with similar source water been operating successfully for at least 12 months? \nDoes the proponent have experience with operating managed aquifer recharge sites with the same or higher degree of \ndifficult, or with water treatment or water supply operations involving a structured approach to water-quality risk \nmanagement? \nDoes the proposed project require development approval? Is it in a built-up area; built on public, flood-prone or steep land; \nor close to a property boundary? Does it contain open water storages or engineering structures; or is it likely to cause public \nhealth or safety issues (e.g. falling or drowning), nuisance from noise, dust, odour or insects (during construction or \noperation), or adverse environmental impacts (e.g. from waste products of treatment processes)? \n \nUnder the NSW AIP proponents of aquifer interference activities including MAR are required to \ndemonstrate that they can obtain the necessary licences, and ensure that minimal impact considerations \ncan be met or propose remedial actions. Minimal impact considerations include impacts on water table \nlevels, water pressure and water quality in different types of groundwater systems, and impacts on \nconnected alluvial aquifers and surface water systems and other water dependent assets. These include \nimpacts on water supply bores, GDEs and culturally significant sites that are groundwater dependent and \ntake account of uncertainty. Thresholds are set so that the impacts of both an individual activity and the \ncumulative impacts of activities within each water source can be considered.  \nThe NSW AIP requires proponents to take a risk management approach to assess the potential impacts of \naquifer interference activities, with the level of detail proportion to a combination of the likelihood of \nimpacts occurring on water resources uses and dependent ecosystems, and potential consequences of \nthese impacts.  The minimal impact assessment provides a rigorous and independent assessment of \npotential impacts of the projects on agricultural land and water resources before a development \napplication can be lodged. Part 4 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 provides a \nstreamlined approval process for the assessment. \n \nGovernance in the Burdekin \nThe system governing the Burdekin River region is quite unique. In the mid-1960s, to stop the intrusion of \nsea water under the already established farming district, farmers and government came together to \nestablish Water Boards \n123 (Dillon et al., 2009a, Evans et al., 2016, Bristow et al., 2000). The Water Boards \n                                                       \n123 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/about-us-2/about-us/, accessed 29 March 2021  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n111 \nwere assigned to manage infiltration based MAR schemes that could limit and reverse sea water intrusion \nwithout restricting irrigation (Dillon et al., 2009a). The Boards have since amalgamated into one QLD Water \nService Provider (Water Supply Act)/Public Utility Provider (Land Title Act 1994) - Lower Burdekin Water - \nfunctioning as a Category 2 Water Authority under the Queensland Water Act 2000 124. The day-to-day \nmanagement of the scheme is controlled by the a board of directors, largely made up of local water users \nor individuals from associated industries (e.g. sugar mills) 125 (Evans et al., 2016). The policy framework for \nthe scheme is set by the Queensland government 126. The schemes success has been attributed to this two-\npronged approach: clear local ‘ownership’ and on the ground control, combined with technical and policy \nsupport from government (Evans et al., 2016). \nA current water licence type in the Burdekin Groundwater Management Area has the purpose of ‘water \nharvesting’ 127. These licences work in a way that is approaching active management. A nominal volume of \nwater is still assigned to the licence, but the availability of the water is subject to water levels in \nrepresentative monitoring bores (i.e., water can be taken only when water levels in the monitoring bore \nassociated with the licence are above a threshold level). This kind of water management required \ntelemetry on the identified representative monitoring bores. This telemetry was installed by the \nDepartment of Natural Resources Mines and Energy.  \n \nAlternative approaches in setting groundwater policy \nAs summarised in Section 5.2.2, flow conditions are applied to extractions of surface water, including from \nspear bores in the bed sands (except historic spear bores in Zones 3-5). Water can only be extracted when \nflows are above a given threshold.  \nThere are other management areas in Queensland that use innovative groundwater policies, for example \ntrigger levels based on aquifer water levels and water quality (GHD, 2014). This type of approach to \nsustainably manage groundwater is through the implementation of rules that can then be associated with \na resource condition limit (RCL), above which the impact on the groundwater system is unacceptable and \nthe rules are triggered (GHD, 2014). To gauge when an RCL has been breached requires a resource \ncondition indictor (RCI). Examples of RCIs include groundwater levels as measured by a piezometer or \ngroundwater salinity measurements.      \nTo set an RCL requires knowledge of the (groundwater) system to be managed (GHD, 2014). Knowledge is \nalso required to establish RCI sites that are representative of the RCL to be implemented (GHD, 2014). \nThere are many properties of a system that may have an associated RCL, including GDEs, aquifer water \nquality, aquifer integrity and surface-groundwater connectivity. \nTable 37 outlines key datasets, reports and approaches that can help identify and implement RCLs/RCIs in a \ngroundwater management setting. Types of rules and associated example RCLs are categorized and \noutlined in Table 38.  \nMore general ways proposed to improve (water) planning and management in the Gilbert catchment \ninclude a cohesive vision for the area with associated policies from a federal, state and local perspective to \nbuild trust in locals, the incorporation of local knowledge and a focus on monitoring (Dale et al., 2014). \n \n \n                                                       \n124 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/about-us-2/governance/, accessed 29 March 2021  \n125 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/about-us-2/board-management/, accessed 29 March 2021 \n126 http://lowerburdekinwater.com.au/about-us-2/board-management/, accessed 29 March 2021 \n127 6 WATER HARVESTING – WATER LICENCE RULES in Burdekin Groundwater Management, Area Water sharing rules, Seasonal \nwater assignment rules Version 6.02 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n112 \nTable 37 Datasets, reports and approaches that can assist in the establishment of rules and resource condition limit (RCL), from the \nidentification to implementation stage.

The number and \ncomplexity of approvals can add considerable cost and time to developments as well as frustrate \nproponents (Ash and Watson, 2018). The relevance (to MAR) of legislation beyond the water sphere is also \nnoted in the US, a leader in MAR adoption (Ulibarri et al., 2021).   \nIn the Gulf and Mitchell Agricultural Land and Water Resource Assessment Report (DNRME, 2004), a list \nwas provided for ‘legislation that is likely to impact on the assessment of future water-related \ndevelopment’. This is summarised in Table 39, where updates and additional policies highlighted by Lyons \net al. (2018) are also included.  \n \nTable 39 Summary of legislation that is likely to impact on the assessment of future water-related development, based on the list provided in \nDNRME (2004) and Lyons et al.

Clearing of vegetation still \npossible under some circumstances (e.g., thinning, for building of infrastructure).   \nEnvironmental Protection Act, \n1994 [QLD] \nAllow development that improves quality of life while protecting the environment, \nespecially natural assets (e.g., rare/endangered species and communities). Outlines the \nprocesses proponents are required to follow to mitigate potentially adverse \nenvironmental impacts.  \nCoastal Protection and \nManagement Act, 1995 [QLD] \nProvides direction on coastal management policy. A proponent should ensure that the \ndownstream impacts of a development are considered and manage impacts to avoid \nnegative environmental outcomes (e.g., in relation to nutrients, sediments, other \ncontaminants). Protects coastal tourism, recreation and fishing industry.  \nFisheries Act, 1994 [QLD] Protects fish habitat, particularly those that act as important nurseries (e.g., floodplain \nswamps, lagoons, billabongs). Provide migration pathways for fish.   \nQueensland Heritage Act, 1992 \n[QLD] \nTo conserve Queensland’s cultural heritage, development proponents must engage \ntraditional owners to identify (and avoid) significant sites and/or develop strategies to \nmanage these sites.   \nNative Title (Queensland) Act, \n1993 [QLD] \nTo manage native title interests and negotiating an Indigenous Land Use Agreement, \nproponents must engage with traditional owners. This is to ensure that traditional owners \nand the land benefit from participating in the proposed project.  \nEnvironment Protection and \nBiodiversity Conservation Act, \n1999 [federal]  \nThe Commonwealth has power to assess proposed developments (and actions more \ngenerally) that are likely to have impacts on matters of national environmental \nsignificance. Areas of significance include World Heritage areas, Ramsar listed wetlands, \nthreatened species, communities of national significance and migratory species protected \neither internationally or by the Commonwealth.  \nPlanning Act, 2016 [QLD] \n(previously Integrated Planning \nAct, 1997 and Sustainable \nPlanning Bill, 2009) \nCoordinating and integrating planning across local, regional and state levels to achieve \necological sustainability, both during the time the development occurs and the on-going \neffects of the development.

Waterway \nbarrier works are regulated under the Planning Act 2016 (or compliance with the Accepted Development \nRequirements) and Fisheries Act 1994. Waterway barriers include weirs and dams, among other structures, \nboth permanent and temporary 128. Queensland waterways have been coded based on the risk of in-\nstream barriers having adverse impacts on fish movement. The code also relates to the level of \ndevelopment approval required for a potential barrier in the waterway. The Gilbert River is coded as \n‘Major’ impact (Figure 77), meaning that new dams and weirs are assessable developments requiring \ndevelopment approval under the Planning Act \n129. Temporary waterway barrier works within major impact \nwaterways are self-assessable 130 and must commence and finish within 180 days 131.  \nThe Planning Regulation 2017 supports the Planning Act 2016 by outlining the mechanisms of the Act. The \nfee for the development application to impound water or construct a barrier in a major risk waterway (e.g., \nGilbert River, Figure 77) is $13,468.00 132.  \nProjects that have economic, social and/or environmental significance to the state can be declared as \ncoordinated projects and can be planned, assessed and approved as such (Lyons et al., 2018). This \ndeclaration would be made by Queensland’s Coordinator-General, under the Planning Act 2016 and \nassociated State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971. Coordinated projects must \nundergo an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or Impact Assessment Report (IAR) (Lyons et al., 2018). \nThis declaration would also have implications for the assessment of a project under the Vegetation \nManagement Act \n133.   \nThe majority of land tenure in the Gilbert is leasehold land, with only a small portion of freehold land (Dale \net al., 2014). The dominance of Crown leasehold land is common in this region of Queensland (Lyons et al., \n2018). Leasehold land is governed by the Land Act 1994 (Lyons et al., 2018). Leasehold land is can only be \nused for the purpose identified in the lease unless otherwise authorised (Lyons et al., 2018). A general duty \nof care is also required by holders of leases on Crown land (Lyons et al., 2018).  \nThere is also substantial Indigenous land in the catchment, whether recognised and managed under native \ntitle, Indigenous land use agreements (ILUAS) or as Indigenous-owned pastoral leases (Figure 78, Figure 79) \n(Dale et al., 2014, Petheram et al., 2013). Water development in much of the catchment, where native title \nexists, will require engagement with Traditional Owners (Lyons et al., 2018). This engagement could take \nthe form of revised ILUAS addressing changes to land and water use that would come from water \ndevelopment (Lyons et al., 2018).  \n \n                                                       \n128 https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/fisheries/habitats/policies-guidelines/factsheets/what-is-a-waterway-barrier-\nwork, accessed 25 April 2021 \n129 5.3 New dams and weirs in Accepted development requirements for operational work that is constructing or raising \nwaterway barrier works (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, 2018), \nhttps://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/1476888/adr-operational-waterway-barrier-works.pdf, accessed 25 \nApril 2021 \n130 Guide for the determination of waterways using the spatial data layer Queensland waterways for waterway barrier works \n(Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2013), \nhttps://www.ipwea.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=fb39d2e0-82af-4c6b-aa35-\n94ad774e7ca3, access 25 April 2021  \n131 7 Temporary waterway barrier works in Accepted development requirements for operational work that is constructing or \nraising waterway barrier works (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, 2018) \n132 Schedule 10, Part 6, Division 4, Subdivision 2, Table 1 in Planning Regulation 2017 \n133 Division 6, Subdivision 1, s 22A in Vegetation Management Act 1999 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n116 \n \nFigure 77 The waterways in the area of interest, coded based on the Queensland waterways for waterway barrier works dataset.

The key role of SARA is \nthe provision of a central point of call, responsible for coordinating and liaising across a multitude of State \nagencies to assist proponents in navigating planning approvals as they relate to state interests (e.g. native \nvegetation clearing, waterway barrier works) \nhttps://planning.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/planning-\nframework/state-assessment-and-referral-agency, accessed 3 December 2021).  \nSARA are also responsible for ensuring that the state interests prescribed by the State Planning Policy \n(https://dsdmipprd.blob.core.windows.net/general/spp-july-2017.pdf\n, accessed 16 December 2021) are \nadequately reflected and protected in local government planning schemes. To assist, SARA maintain the \nState Planning Policy (SPP) Interactive Mapping System (IMS) and Development Assessment Mapping \nSystem (DAMS; \nhttps://planning.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/planning-framework/mapping, accessed 3 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n118 \nDecember 2021). The latter provides mapping that can help proponents identify development assessment \ntriggers that pertain to state interests and state planning matters. The DAMS can also assist proponents in \naddressing the assessment benchmarks prescribed by the State Development Assessment Provisions \n(SDAP). Mapping is also available from local councils which can help proponents identify development \nassessment triggers from a local government perspective under a council’s planning scheme.  \n \n \nFigure 79 Indigenous land use agreements and Indigenous-controlled pastoral leases in the Gilbert catchment (Source: Petheram et al., 2013). \n \nIn the context of water related development, including MAR, SARA would provide a central point of \ncontact for proponents requiring development approval for state interests and state planning matters. \nBefore a development application is lodged, SARA is able to provide proponents with a pre-lodgement \nservice that assists proponents in identifying what referrals are required. SARA will liaise with various state \nagencies who have a state interest impacted by the proposal. From there, the state agencies will provide \ntechnical advice back to SARA who then provide a single, consolidated response back to the proponent. For \ncomplex, multi-jurisdictional matters, engaging a planning consultant is encouraged.  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n119 \nIf a water related development was considered assessable under a local government planning scheme, that \nlocal council would be classed as the assessment manager for that development application. In this \ninstance, SARA would be the referral agency, and the various other state departments would provide \ntechnical advice, including recommended conditions, to SARA pertaining to their state interests. SARA then \nprovide a single, consolidated response back to the local council with each state agencies conditions to be \nattached to any development approval. If the water related development did not require local government \napproval, SARA would be the assessment manager and the various other state departments would again \nprovide the technical advice, including recommended conditions. SARA then provide the proponent with a \ndecision, which could include not approved, approved, or approved with conditions (as recommended by \nthe state departments).  \nFor matters which sit outside the planning framework (i.e. water licences, land tenure) a project proponent \nwould be directed to engage directly with the relevant state agency (i.e. the Department of Regional \nDevelopment, Manufacturing and Water (DRDMW) to obtain these authorisations. Advice on water related \nmatters can be obtained directly from DRDMW via their Water Management contacts \n(https://www.rdmw.qld.gov.au/about-us/contact\n; accessed 16 December 2021).  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n120 \n6. Towards an improved conceptualization of river bed sand aquifers in the \nGilbert River catchment \n6.1 Representation of the bed sands in the eWater Source model \nSeveral iterations of eWater Source models have been developed during the CSIRO FGARA project and \nsubsequently. Each of them focuses on exploring water resources development at the basin scale. This is \nachieved using empirical hydrological models focused on surface water (i.e., rainfall-runoff and routing \nmodels), where groundwater dynamics were not to be modelled explicitly. Purchasing access to the \ncurrent model was out of scope of this project, so the discussion is based on our understanding of the final \nmodel developed in the FGARA project (Julien Lerat pers comm., 2021) and subsequent documentation \n(DSITIA, 2014). Based on that understanding, the bed sands are treated as a single storage node – node \n043 (DSITIA, 2014)(Julien Lerat pers comm., 2021). This node represents the bed sands upstream of the \nGilbert River at the Rockfields streamflow gauge (917001D) (Julien Lerat pers comm., 2021), having a \nstorage volume of 19,480 ML () (DSITIA, 2014). The storage includes a ‘valve’ that can release discharge, \neven when the storage is not full (Julien Lerat pers comm., 2021). The release is assumed to be a linear \nfunction of the water level in the bed sands: 0 when the storage is empty up to 19,489 ML/day when the \nstorage is full.  \nWhile the storage is only represented as a volume at a node, in order to estimate drawdown, the \nQueensland Government have subsequently interpreted the bed sands as a box of uniform depth (DSITIA, \n2014), as shown in Figure 80. Parameter values associated with this representation of the bed sands are \nsummarised in . To convert from maximum volume (m3) to maximum saturated sand layer thickness \n(depth, m) the former was multiplied by specific yield of the aquifer then divided by the surface area in m2 \n(all values shown in Table 40). This conversion is outlined in Figure 81. Multiplying the maximum volume by \nthe specific yield accounts for the fact that water only occupies the pore space of the sand/gravel of the \nbed sands (i.e., with a specific yield of 0.2, a maximum of 20% of the total bed sand volume can be water). \nThe process used to calculate the volume of water in the bed sands and the depth-to-water table on a daily \ntime step is as follows (DSITIA, 2014): \n1. Calculate a conversion factor (Table 40) by dividing the maximum water volume in ML (Table 40) by \nthe calculated maximum saturated sand thickness (Table 40) \n \n2. Convert the daily Gilbert River bed sand volumes outputs from the eWater Source model node to \nthickness values using the conversion factor (Table 40) to create a daily time series of saturated \nsand layer thickness \n• Values range from 0 – 4.94 metres \n \n3. Calculate daily depth-to-water table by subtracting the maximum saturated sand layer thickness \n(Table 40) from the daily modelled thickness \nReported difficulties with at least one iteration of the Gilbert eWater Source model include the tendency to \noverestimate both low flows and the frequency of cease-to-flow events (Lerat et al., 2013). As the bed \nsands may play a vital ecological role during low flow regimes, further work has been suggested to upgrade \nthe model for both improved ecological understanding and water allocation assessment (DSITIA, 2014). \nHowever, the nature of the further work needed has not yet been identified. \n  \n \n \n \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n121 \nTable 40 Reported and calculated characteristics of the bed sand aquifer in the eWater Source model \nCharacteristic Value \nMaximum Volume 134 97,400,000 m3 \nSpecific Yield 135 0.2 \nSurface Area 136 19.676 x 106 m2 \nMaximum Water Volume 137 19,480 ML (= 19,480,000 m3) \nMaximum saturated sand layer thickness (depth) 138 4.94 m \nLength 139 54 km = 54,000 m \nWidth 140 364.4 m \nConversion factor 141 3,943.32 ML m-1 \n \n \nFigure 80 Representation of how the Gilbert River bed sands were modelled in DSITIA (2014), including the Rockfields gauge (917001D). The \nblue lines represent the river bed level, illustrating that the bed sands are subsurface.  \n \n6.2 Proposed extension of the river bed sands conceptualization \nThere are four key processes that are not included in the current model that we propose would improve \nsimulation and might support changes to management and policy surrounding the bed sands.  The four \nprocesses are groundwater flow, underflow under the gauge, infiltration, and surface flow hydraulics. \nCurrently, the water level in the bed sands is assumed to increase or decrease uniformly across the aquifer \nin response to pumping and recharge within a single timestep (a single day). In reality, and importantly \nfrom the managed aquifer recharge point of view, water is expected to flow within the aquifer, governed \nby groundwater flow equations. Depending on the transmissivity of the bed sands, we expect a slope in the \nhydraulic head that attenuates over time after pumping or recharge ceases. Put another way, this would \nimprove the representation of local drawdown effects within the bed sands (Figure 82), rather than \ntreating the bed sands as one unit where the hydraulic head is uniform. The length of the bed sands (Table \n                                                       \n134 Back calculated using the reported maximum water volume and specific yield.

The reported values can be found in the Targeted \nreview of Water Resource (Gulf) Plan 2007, Environmental Assessment.  \n141 Calculated by dividing the reported maximum water volume in ML by the calculated maximum saturated sand thickness. The \nreported values can be found in the Targeted review of Water Resource (Gulf) Plan 2007, Environmental Assessment.  \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n122 \n40) suggests that groundwater flow may be a significant factor depending on hydraulic properties. Section \n6.3.2 provides a first assessment of the expected significance of this effect. \n \n \nFigure 81 Converting from maximum thickness to maximum saturated sand layer thickness \n \nFigure 82 Simple depiction of local drawdown effects in response to extraction  \nDue to the sandy composition of the aquifer, it is hypothesised that underflow under the gauge could be \nan important process in the bed sands (Figure 83) 142. The bed sands as modelled in eWater Source have \nclear spatial bounds within the Gilbert River, whereas in reality they would form part of the alluvial aquifer \nthat extends both upstream and downstream of the modelled bed sand unit. Therefore, water would likely \nenter the modelled bed sand unit from upstream and be lost downstream, additionally to the water that \ninfiltrates when there are surface flows. Underflow may also occur from the deeper sandstone aquifers \nthough past reports have suggested little connectivity between the bed sands and the underlying aquifers \n(DNRME, 2006b, DNRME, 2018b). This is juxtaposed with the anecdotal suggestion that some spear bores \nnever run dry because the section of bed sands is at an outcropping of the deeper sandstone aquifer. This \nprovides a user with high yield throughout the entirety of the dry season. Another user’s bore a little \nfurther downstream could not extract water throughout the whole dry season (typically yields declined by \n                                                       \n142 Underflow is the term for water entering into or exiting an aquifer system via subsurface flow.

Explicit representation of groundwater flow would be expected to tackle underflow also, though \nspecific attention would need to be given to surface-groundwater connection and hyporheic exchange, \nbetween river channels and surrounding sediments. \n \nFigure 83 Simple depiction of underflow, where water is entering (and exiting) an alluvial aquifer system without infiltrating from above  \nAnother process discounted in the current modelling of the bed sands is the infiltration time to fill. In the \nmodel, every drop of inflow immediately contributes to storage. Due to the flashiness of the flows in the \narea, there may be times when an event does not completely fill the bed sands (as depicted in Figure 84). \nThis would be particularly true for smaller events at the start of the season. Only part of the flow event \nwould contribute to recharge. The infiltration rate will depend on properties of the sands/gravels and \npresence of any preferential flow paths, as well as on the area inundated, recognising that flows frequently \nonly occur on parts of the surface area of the Gilbert River and bed sands. Assuming an infiltration rate of \n255 mm/day (DNRME, 2006b), the total infiltration volume (with the surface area in ) would be 5012.38 \nML/day (See Section 6.3.3). \nA representation of hydraulics is the standard approach to quantify inundation (surface water) and surface \nwater movement in the riverbed (Figure 85). Flow is affected by riverbed geometry (which may change \nover time in response through hydrogeomorphological processes) and surface roughness. This analysis \nwould be at a finer spatial scale than a lumped hydrological model, which focuses on the overall water \nbalance of a system. Hydraulics would also link to infiltration via a seepage parameter while keeping the \nprocesses distinct. In addition to inflow from (ungauged) tributaries, hydraulics of bed sands overlain by \ntributaries could also be explicitly modelled to account for their contribution to recharge. Dynamic \nconditions with sudden flow events, e.g. the effect of entrapped air, could also be an issue. \nAs shown in Figure 86, the division of the flows into distinct paths could be an important process at the end \nof the wet season (i.e., during low flow periods). Together with underflow, it would also dictate the \nformation of dry season waterholes, an important refuge for aquatic species during the dry season \n(Waltham et al., 2013).               \n \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n124 \n \nFigure 84 A simple depiction of a flash flow event.

(c) The water table increases in response.  \n \nFigure 85 Simple depiction of how a hydraulic representation of surface water may look. The surface is gridded and the presence of water is \nassessed on a grid scale basis. \nThe hydrological properties of groundwater flow, underflow under the gauge, infiltration, and hydraulics \nare key to conceptualising the behaviour of the bed sands if they are to be actively managed as a water \nstorage. By improving understanding of the key processes, modelled outputs could better simulate low \nflow and cease-to-flow events, allowing for more finely tuned management and supporting policy. It has \nbeen suggested that periods where the depth of water in the bed sands exceeds 2.5 m is a potential threat \nto GDEs (DSITIA, 2014). By simulating how drawdown fluctuates as a result of extraction at varying \ndistances from the extraction point via groundwater flow equations, adequate depth to water levels can be \nmaintained where required (i.e., to support GDEs) and increased where GDEs are absent. Knowledge of \nwhere GDEs are located along the stretch of the bed sands would be required to modify drawdown limits \nspatially. It should be noted that the threshold of 2.5m is not currently used as a trigger value to manage \nextraction from the bed sands in low flow conditions, which instead has an associated annual maximum \nextraction limit that equals the sum of current bed sand entitlements (Section 5.2.1, Figure 19, Table 9). \nIncorporating groundwater flow equations would also allow for the assessment of the impact of extraction \nfrom one bore on adjacent bores. This knowledge could be used to assess the impact of additional bores \nand associated water licences on current users. The filling phase of the bed sands is of particular \nimportance to understand when the bed sands are full (i.e., completely saturated). Infiltration and \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n125 \nhydraulic modelling could be used to understand the filling phase, with the intention of maximising filling \nvia interventions (e.g., MAR) and prolonging when drawdown starts. \n  \n \nFigure 86 A period of low flow in the Gilbert River. This image was captured on the 8th of April 2021. The gauged flow on this day was 194.11 \nML/day (Gilbert River at Rockfields gauge). \n \n6.3 Preliminary analyses to support future model development \nWhile the development of a new model for the bed sands is out of scope of this project, this section \nincludes three preliminary analyses: an analysis of historical hydrographs, an analysis of the significance of \naquifer properties for groundwater flow, and an analysis of possible infiltration volumes. Analysis of \nhistorical hydrographs can help identify the periods of time that are most relevant to active management \nof the bed sands, most affected by the changes to the conceptualisation, and which we expect have the \ngreatest potential to improve model simulations. Preliminary analysis of groundwater flow can provide an \nindication of the magnitude of the effect of aquifer properties on spatial variation in drawdown. Possible \ninfiltration volumes indicate the significance of infiltration processes at times of recharge. \n \n Analysis of the hydrographs \nThis analysis provides a preliminary assessment of the periods we expect to be most relevant to active \nmanagement of bed sands recharge and/or affected by changes to the conceptual model of the bed sands. \nPrevious modelling efforts note the overestimation of low flow and frequency of cease-to-flow events \n(Lerat et al., 2013). An example of a time when a spatially explicit understanding of drawdowns may be \nimportant is into the dry season, when GDEs may rely on water stored in the bed sands until the onset of \nthe next wet season. Infiltration processes would be important during the initial filling of the bed sands \n(onset of wet season) and also during late flow events in the dry season (e.g., mid-July to start of August \n2016 in Figure 87 b)) once drawdown has begun. Inundation dynamics may be important into the dry \nseason when streamflow ceases but waterholes are scattered along the river reach.   \nThere is a stream gauge located immediately downstream of the modelled bed sand aquifer - Gilbert River \nat Rockfields (917001D143). The last several years of data from this gauge was plotted to understand \nobserved streamflow over the bed sands for July to June, the water year (Figure 87 a–e).  \n                                                       \n143 https://water-monitoring.information.qld.gov.au/, accessed 31 May 2021 \n\nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n126 \nThis analysis highlights the interannual variability in flows. For example, peak flows in both the 2017/18 \n(Figure 87 c)) and 2018/19 (Figure 87 d)) wet seasons were substantially higher than those in the other \nyears plotted, whilst the 2019/20 wet season was particularly dry (Figure 87 e)). Another phenomenon \nevident from the flow regime is that streamflow is highly event driven in response to rainfall in the \ncatchment (Figure 87). For example, in the 2018/19 water year, the wet season streamflow was dominated \nby one large event, with minimal discharge otherwise (Figure 87 d)). In other years, however, there were \nmultiple periods with considerable discharge past the gauge (Figure 87 a) – c) and e)).  \nInspecting the hydrograph, coupled with anecdotal reports from bed sands water users, allows for \nestimation of the status of the bed sands. By mid-February, it could be assumed that the bed sands are full. \nThis is supported by the already high flow volumes that have been recorded at the Rockfields gauge by this \ntime in the wet season (Figure 87 a – e). The cross-section at the gauge indicates the full width of the river \nis inundated with a water level of ~4 m above the reference, which corresponds to a flow of ~120 cumecs \n(~10,000 ML/day) according to the rating curve. Given substantially higher flows and a maximum water \nvolume of ~20,000 ML (Table 40), even relatively low rates of infiltration would likely fill the bed sands (see \nSection 6.3.3). \nSurface flows decrease substantially around the start of April (Figure 87 a – e), and this is also the time \nafter which surface water flows can no longer be extracted in accordance with the flow conditions \napplicable to new licenses in the Gilbert catchment \n144. From April to July or August (depending on the \nyear), there are limited surface flows recorded at the gauge (Figure 87 a – e). However, it is possible that \nsuch flows would continuously top up the bed sands as drawdown occurs due to underflow and any \npumping. This would be a period to ensure that the bed sands are completely full before the surface flows \ncease. Every year there are periods of no recorded surface flows throughout the dry season (Figure 87 a) – \ne)). The 2019 dry season experienced an especially long cease-to-flow period, lasting from mid-June to \nDecember (Figure 87 d – e). It is during the cease-to-flow period that drawdowns would not be refilled, \nexcept perhaps from limited underflow from upstream alluvial aquifers. Even in years where surface flows \nare almost continuously recorded at the gauge (Figure 87 c), surface water-bed sand connections are likely \nstill relevant as recharge may not keep up with pumping, and continuous drawdown may in fact increase \nlosses from surface flows and perennial pools. Anecdotal reports suggest that one spear bore downstream \nof the Rockfields gauge often runs dry towards the end of the dry season. The depth of this spear bore is 8 \nm. However, a bore licensee upstream of the gauge reported that their spear bore never ran dry, being \nhigh yielding year-round. This variation in the experience of water users provides an argument for a more \ndynamic modelling of the bed sands beyond the use of simple storages.   \n                                                       \n144 https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf, \naccessed 9 June 2021 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n127 \n    \n  \n  \n  \n     \nFigure 87 Discharge (ML/day) as measured at the is Gilbert River at Rockfields (917001D) gauge for the past several years (July – June).

The Neuman solution assumes \nuniform hydraulic conductivity and continuous pumping from a single well, with groundwater flowing \nradially inwards to the well. The bounds of the aquifer are not specified, so the credibility of the distance at \nwhich drawdown occurs needs to be considered when interpreting the results. The process of estimating \nwater level is termed ‘Forward Solution’ in the AQTESOLV software. The data supplied to AQTESOLV, and \nits source if applicable, are outlined in Table 40 . Any values not outlined are kept at the default value, with \nthe exception of the observation bore coordinates, which were updated multiple times to estimate \ndisplacement at varying distances from the pumping bore.  \n \nTable 41 Data required by AQTESOLV to estimate displacement as a result of pumping in an unconfined aquifer using the Neuman solution \n(Neuman, 1974). \nCharacteristic Value \nMaximum saturated sand layer thickness (depth) (b) 146 4.94 m \nPumping rate 147 1.8 m3/min (= 30 L/sec) \nTime since pumping started  Two time slices: 100 minutes; 161,280 minutes (16 weeks) \nHydraulic Conductivity Anisotropy Ratio (Kv/Kh) 148 0.05 \nTransmissivity (T) 149 3.29375 m2/min (= 4743 m2/day) \nStorativity (S) 150 0.2 \n \nAs expected, drawdown decreases with increasing distance from the pumping location (Figure 88).  Under \nthe assumption that pumping was to occur for only 100 minutes, there would be a total of 0.18 ML \nextracted from aquifer. Drawdown would be seen close to the spear bore but is minor, if at all, at distances \ngreater than 200 m from where the pumping occurs (Figure 88). After pumping ceases, local drawdown \nwould be expected to attenuate with flows from elsewhere in the aquifer. Repeated short periods of \npumping would therefore be expected to result in short periods of marginally more acute drawdown (~10 \ncm here). However, as the dry period progresses, pumping is likely to be continuous for long periods of \ntime, as the irrigation water is rotated through a planted area. Using the same volume of water extraction \n(0.18 ML) drawdown was calculated using the box assumption as outlined in Section 6.1 (dashed blue line \nin Figure 88), yielding minimal drawdown (Figure 88). \n \n                                                       \n145 http://www.aqtesolv.com/#main-menu, access 15 Jun 2021 \n146 As reported in the Targeted review of Water Resource (Gulf) Plan 2007, Environmental Assessment  \n147 Based on yield estimates from the bed sands (See Section 5.3.6) \n148 Calculated based on the vertical and horizontal transmissivity determined from a pumping test in the Gilbert River alluvium, \nas reported in Jolly et al.

Depth (b) and specific yield (Sy) is as reported in Table 39.  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n129 \nUnder the assumption that pumping from the single well was to occur for 16 weeks, there would be a total \nof 290.3 ML extracted from the aquifer. This is less than the maximum volumetric limit for the bed sands as \na whole or any of the bed sand zones (Section 5.2.1) but is already sufficient to see a modelled whole of \naquifer response horizontally. Once again drawdowns are larger closer to the spear bore but persist \nbeyond the estimated bed sand width (~360 m, Figure 88). That is, beyond that distance, instead of the \ndrawdown modelled here, one would expect that drawdown will extend further upstream and \ndownstream. The full width of the aquifer is involved in supplying water, and effects are already \npropagating along the length of the aquifer to distances of over 1 km. Modelled drawdowns are limited \nbeyond 8,500 m (data not shown), which is less than the full length of the aquifer (54,000 m; , Figure 80). \nUsing the box assumption (Section 6.1) and the volume of water extracted here (290.3 ML), the modelled \ndrawdown over the entire aquifer was less than 10 cm (green dashed line in Figure 88). Drawdowns \nmodelled using the Neuman solution (Neuman, 1974) were substantially higher close to the pumping \nsource but at ~ 900 m were less than what is estimated using the box assumption (Figure 88). This \nhighlights the discounting of local drawdown effects when using the box assumption. The box assumption \nalso does not account for the increased underflow or increased recharge from other points (Alley and \nLeake, 2004). With higher volumes of pumping which result in a whole aquifer response (both width and \nlength), the box-aquifer approximation would become increasingly appropriate, though local \nheterogeneity in hydraulic properties may still have an impact. While the spatial variation in drawdown is \nrelatively small (on the order of 10-50 cm for 290.3 ML), this difference may be significant in evaluating \nwhether the threshold of 2.5 m drawdown is breached and may make a meaningful difference in allowing \nwater to be taken later in the dry season.  \nThese preliminary analyses show that the large surface water flows relative to the size of the bed sands \nstorage mean that topping-up of the aquifer at the end of the season is likely more important than initial \nfilling and that spatial effects of drawdown are expected to be subtle. Therefore, going beyond the current \nvolumetric limit of 5082 ML/year requires relatively intensive understanding of bed sands recharge and \ndrawdown behaviours and fine-tuned intervention, and existing data is not sufficient to identify whether \nany large gains might be possible for relatively small interventions. Managed aquifer recharge is therefore \nbest approached through active management of existing water resources in a whole of systems \nperspective rather than through any single large recharge infrastructure development. \n \n Infiltration  \nThree infiltration rates (both measured and estimated) were used to assess maximum daily infiltration \nvolumes (Table 42, Figure 89).  \nThe infiltration volumes reported in Table 42 are estimates and do not account for preferential flow \npathways (that would increase infiltration) and local barriers or areas of impermeability such as rock bars \n(DNRME, 2006b).  \nIn Figure 89, recharge into the bed sands is infiltration-limited during events larger than the estimated \nthreshold (dashed lines) and water-limited when the flow is smaller than the threshold. The infiltration \nthreshold is rarely exceeded outside the peak of the wet season (Jan – April) (Figure 89), meaning that \nrecharge into the system is water-limited throughout the majority of the year. \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n130 \n \n  \nFigure 88 Drawdown (m) at different radial distances from a pumping bore (m), estimated using the Neuman solution (Neuman, 1974) in the \nAQTESOLV software and the data in Table 40.

Synthesis \n7.1 Key learnings \nThe comparatively ‘greenfields’ nature of irrigated agriculture and water resource development in the \nGilbert catchment meant this case study was very different to the previous study in Coleambally \n(Guillaume et al., 2020). Key learnings from the pre-feasibility assessment follow.     \nWater availability: At first glance water availability does not seem like a major issue in this case study due \nto the large flow events observed in the catchment and the low uptake of new, and use of current, \nentitlements 151. However, the entitlements currently available are associated with flow conditions \nmeaning that water can only be taken when the flow conditions are met 152; that is, during substantial flow \nevents when the catchment has received rain. The water requirements for a cropping enterprise is low at \nthis time compared to the end of the wet season and into the dry season. This could explain the low \nuptake of the water licences, compounded by the relatively limited adoption of water infrastructure such \nas farm dams to store the water between extraction from the river and use.  \nThere are several current active licences where extraction of water from the bed sands occur, and usage \nfrom these licences is below the maximum allowed 153. Purchases of new entitlements currently up for \ntender are not prevented from taking from the bed sands although any would be subject to the same flow \nconditions as extracting river flows.  \nEnvironment: Any water development is associated with environmental risks. In the Gilbert catchment, \nsustainable irrigation development is possible 154 but would have to be accompanied by the ramping up of \nmonitoring with a focus on at risk ecosystems. There are suggestions of environmental assets that may be \nat risk if water use was to change 155, although this is based on limited information and negligible \nmonitoring. Hyporheic ecosystems may be at risk from further extraction from the Gilbert River bed sands. \nIndeed, it has been suggested that current extraction could already be impacting the hyporheic ecosystems \nof the bed sands. The nature and extent of any impact is unknown and undocumented. Groundwater \ndependent ecosystems (GDEs) could also be impacted by increased water extraction from the bed sands. \nThe current volumetric limits on extraction from the bed sands has been modelled to result in a very small \nimpact on GDEs 156.  \nTechnical feasibility: The bed sands are suggested as the most viable option for MAR given the good water \nquality (low risk of salinity 157) of these waters, the low yields from the sandstone aquifers 158, and the high \nevaporative demand and high infiltration of surface storages 159. This follows the findings of past MAR \nassessments in the region 160. Multiple MAR interventions could be used in the Gilbert River, small off-\nstreams and the alluvium adjacent to the river 161. These include leaky weirs constructed across the small \nstreams to rehydrate the land, recharge weirs to slow flows and infiltration basins that target the alluvial \naquifer that extend beyond the river bed (if these are confirmed to exist). As a way to complement surface \n                                                       \n151 Section 5.2.2 and Table 8 \n152 Table 10 \n153 Section 5.2.1 \n154 Section 5.5.4 \n155 Section 5.5.1 \n156 Page 86 Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) \n157 Page 53 Focus aquifer in the GRAP  \n158 Figure 30, Section 5.3.1, Section 5.3.6 \n159 Section 3.1, Section 5.3.2 \n160 Section 5.3.4 \n161 Section 5.3.5 \n \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n133 \nwater infrastructure, a recharge release strategy could be implemented. This would involve the recharge of \nbed sands by strategic releases from an upstream dam.  \nGovernance arrangements: Current water policy in the catchment is focused on growing surface water use \n162. A review of the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 is set for 2027 163, so this would be an ideal time to catalyse \npolicy change to update the rules around bed sand use and to develop policy to allow for intentional \nstorage of river water in the bed sand aquifer.  It is possible that governance arrangements in the Burdekin \n164 could inform future policy development in the Gilbert. Beyond water policy, there are many other Acts \nand policies that water infrastructure would have to satisfy 165. Major hurdles include the Vegetation \nManagement Act and Fisheries Act.    \nActive management could be suitable approach were policy changed to allow further utilisation of the bed \nsands. This approach would adapting management (and water policy) based on new knowledge and \nunderstanding gained over time. Critically, it would involve collecting information on the bed sands – \nnamely an increase in data and monitoring to support improved risk assessment of environmental and \nsocial impacts – to improve (over time) understanding of how the system works. The ‘action-state-\nconsequence’ framework could provide a useful tool for active management 166, as could the preliminary \nefforts to develop an improved conceptualisation of the bed sands 167. \n \n7.2 Recommendations \nBased on the scenarios presented in Section 4, we conclude that MAR shows some promise in the GRAP, \nalthough would need to be part of a systems approach to sustainable water resource development. \nInvestment in MAR has the potential to support incremental development of irrigated agriculture in the \nregion, including cotton production by providing water at a time when it is needed to finish crops, and \npotentially sustain crops if there is a break in the rainfall post-germination.   \nTo conclude, recommendations are provided in Table 43, drawing on the developed MAR scenarios and \nthe pre-feasibility assessment. Recommendations are framed differently for each group: \n• Landholders as a potential driver of farm-scale MAR \n• Local organisations, including ESC as a prospective local driver of regional-scale MAR or \nfacilitator of farm-scale MAR, and GSNRM as facilitators of a community supported \nactive management approach to sustainable MAR \n• State government as data and model custodian and regulator \n• CRDC (or other research and development investors) as a potential facilitator or \nsupporter who can influence or leverage other activities in this space. \nThese recommendations broadly relate to (a) improving knowledge systems relating to water resources \nand, specifically the alluvial riverbed sands, or (b) developing the management arrangements necessary for \nan active management approach to water development and use. While the recommendations were \ndeveloped with a focus on the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct, the recommendations also apply to other \nmonsoonal areas with bed sands at a similar stage of agricultural development and scientific knowledge. \nThe recommendations take a staged approach, targeting initial no-regret actions that minimize initial \ninvestment and provide value regardless of the extent to which active management and managed aquifer \nrecharge are later pursued.  \n                                                       \n162 Section 5.7.1 \n163 Section 5.7.2 \n164 Section 5.7.4 \n165 Section 5.7.3 \n166 Section 5.3.7 \n167 Section 6 \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n134 \nTable 43 Recommendations for initial steps for implementation of managed aquifer recharge and active management of the bed sands \n Landholders Local organisations, \nincluding Etheridge \nShire Council, Gulf \nSavannah Natural \nResource \nManagement Group \nState government R&D organisations \n(e.g., CRDC) \nImproving \nknowledge \nsystems \nEvaluate current \nwater use \narrangements, \nespecially spear \nbore use; plan \nmonitoring to \nresolve gaps and \nidentify \nimprovements \nBuild capacity for site-\nspecific assessment \nand planning of water \nstorage management, \nincluding regional \ndatasets \nPartner to improve monitoring, \nconceptualisation and \nmodelling of bed sands and \nassociated impacts to inform \nassessment of active \nmanagement arrangements \nBuild capacity for \nlandholder \ngroundwater use and \nstatus monitoring, and \nmonsoonal water \nstorage options \nassessment \nElaboration of \nmanagement \narrangements \nKeep records of \nwater levels and use \nof spear bores and \nconsider \nopportunities to \nshare information \nand collaborate on \nplanning \nInvestigate possible \nbusiness models and \nscope of a potential \nlocal water \nmanagement \norganisation, \nconsidering possible \npartnerships and a \nsystems view of \nstorage options \nCo-design requirements for \nMAR, including active \nmanagement of bed sands, for \nconsideration in 2027 review of \nthe Gulf Water Plan (2007). This \nwould include consideration of \ncondition-based limits, MEL \nframework, and guidelines for \napprovals, water accounting \nand impact reporting \nSupport development \nof public-private \ninformation sharing \narrangements and \ncoordination \nmechanisms, to go \nbeyond extraction \nlimits and encourage \nactive management \nand stewardship of \nresources \n \nImprovement of knowledge systems includes landholder reflection on how water is currently accessed, \nparticularly in the dry season, the information currently available about the resources being used, and \nidentification of opportunities to complete this information in order to plan possible improvements. This \ncan be supported by building capacity for this type of assessment regionally by local organisations, and \nmore generally by R&D organisations in the sector. As reliance on groundwater increases and cotton \nproduction expands in monsoonal areas, it is particularly important for CRDC to support capacity of levy \npayers in these areas. As state government holds responsibilities as regulator and data and model \ncustodian, they play an important role in improving understanding of bed sands, but in the context of \nassessment of active management arrangements would benefit from partnering in this task to address \nrequirements beyond those tackled in previous water resource planning and leverage local knowledge. A \nlearning-focused “digital twin” can help tackle this set of recommendations by providing a repository to \nbring together diverse knowledge sources. Combining computer models and a database of quantitative \nand qualitative data to describe water resources at multiple scales can help track conditions and facilitate \ndiscussion of information sharing and information collection needs of all stakeholders involved. \n \nActive management firstly depends on change in the Gulf Water Plan (2007) to move towards condition-\nbased limits that provide more freedom for experimentation with bed sands management while retaining \nsufficient confidence through a monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) framework, and guidelines for \napprovals, water accounting of interception and recharge, and reporting of impacts, including \narrangements for sharing of data and associated costs. This change is sufficiently demanding that it \nrequires strong stakeholder buy-in and a collaborative co-creation process. The scheduled review in 2027 \nprovides a realistic target for a first iteration of this type of arrangement. This will likely require support \nfrom R&D organisations to develop information sharing and coordination arrangements, and from local \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n135 \norganisations to explore possible models for a local water management organisation that could lead active \nmanagement of water resources. The facilitation role of these organisations is particularly critical given the \nhistorical focus on government-led setting of extraction limits and the radical departure that active \nmanagement of the water resource therefore represents. Local monitoring and information sharing by \nlandholders is expected to be a critical starting point, especially if a farm-scale rather than regional-scale \napproach is pursued. While local organisations, state government, and R&D organisations are critical to \nprovide enablers and mitigate barriers, successful active management of bed sands and dry season water \nstorage above all capitalises on bottom-up landholder initiative and involvement rather than disruptive \noutside change from any single large infrastructure development. \n  \nFeasibility assessment of managed aquifer recharge for cotton irrigation in the Gilbert: Final case study report \n       \n136 \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was funded by the Cotton Research & Development Corporation (CRDC).

Industry-\nwide safer use of mobile plant is likely to require a \nspecific focus on each type. \nReducing fatalities and serious \ninjuries in agriculture associated \nwith mobile plant\nRural Safety & Health Alliance Research Short Report - May 2024\nRSHA| Mobile Plant Research Pack 2024 4\nThe Rural Safety and Health Alliance is a cross-sectoral \ncollaboration comprising eight Rural Research and Development \nCorporations: AgriFutures Australia, Australian Eggs, Australian \nPork Limited, Australian Wool Innovation, Cotton Research and \nDevelopment Corporation, Dairy Australia, Grains Research and \nDevelopment Corporation, and Meat and Livestock Australia.\nThe interviews and survey reinforced that Australian \nfarmers are very aware of the potential for injury \nassociated with mobile plant. People in the sector \nsee the big risks to safety as time pressures, fatigue, \ndistraction, lack of operator competency, machinery \nneglect and equipment modification. \nThis is a significant shift in attitudes prevailing in the \nearly 2000s where incidents were often regarded as \n“just part of being a farmer”.\nConcern about serious repercussions of injury \nfor the farming family or farm business, a feeling \nof being vulnerable and that ‘it could happen on \nmy farm’, is one of the pre-conditions for taking \npreventative action.\nUnder the Health Belief Model, perceived benefits \nand barriers to acting are strong predictors for \nadopting preventative practices - and the benefits \nneed to outweigh the barriers for individuals to act.\nWhile many benefits of adopting safe practices \nwere mentioned at interview (such as avoiding harm \nto family or co-workers, reducing the costs and \ndisruption of an incident, and the risk of regulatory \naction), the perceived barriers (such as time \npressures, workload, the expense of doing proactive \nmaintenance, availability of experienced staff, \ntraining resources etc) are substantial.\nRSHA piloted use of the Rasmussen-inspired model \nrecommended by Work Science to systematically \nexamine risks across the safety system for augers. \nThis approach readily identified areas that would \nbenefit from better alignment and advocacy within \nthe agricultural sector.\nSummary\nThis report shows that safe use of mobile plant is \na concern for those in the sector and on farm. The \nfindings suggest that reducing perceived barriers, \nbuilding self-efficacy and reinforcing the benefits of \nadopting safe practices will encourage behaviour \nchange. The auger case study shows the potential \nfor on farm practices to be made universally safer \nby acting on significant issues identified in non-farm \naspects of the safety system.\nRecommendations\nThe following recommendations are in accordance \nwith the RSHA objective of using evidence-based \ninformation to make targeted collaborative RD&E \ninvestment decisions, where investment can have \nboth human and economic impact.\nRecommendation 1: Focus specifically on the \ndifferent mobile plant types when aiming for \nindustry-wide safer use of mobile plant.\nRecommendation 2: Work with the benefits, \nbarriers and cues for action when designing safety \ncampaigns for specific mobile plant types.\nRecommendation 3: Consider using the Rasmussen-\ninspired model to fast-track factors in the whole \nsafety system that may be influencing safety on \nfarm (for a mobile plant and potentially other \naspects of WHS).\nRSHA04 Research \nshort report, May 2024\nRSHA| Mobile Plant Research Pack 2024 5\nNext steps: taking \nmobile plant safety \nto agricultural \nstakeholders\nIdentify perceived barriers \nand benefits to practicing \nsafe behaviours on farm\nResearch approach\nRSHA investment into how to influence safe use of mobile plant on farm\nConduct a scoping \nliterature review\nSummarise available \nevidence, key concepts \n& limits of knowledge \nChoose conceptual \nframeworks to explore \nbehaviours and system\nInterview stakeholders \nacross the system\nIdentify themes to build \nunderstanding of safe \nplant use\nDescribe behaviours & \ncontextual factors that \naffect safe use on farm\nDevelop survey to describe \npractices and perceptions \non farm\nUse Health Belief Model to \nexplore opportunities for \nbehaviour change of farmers\nUse Rasmussen-inspired \nmodel to explore aspects of \nthe whole safety system on \nand off farm\nIdentify safe \n(and unsafe) behaviours \nand cues to action\n      Better understand \nhow to initiate and sustain \nbehaviour change on farm\nWork Science PRO-016219\n      Identify practical ways \nto underpin safe use of \nspecific plant from whole \nsafety system assessment\nDevelop approach to \nexamine safety system for \nspecific plant/equipment\nCase study assessing entire \nsafety system for mobile \naugers\n• Snapshot on safety \nperceptions/ practices\n• Industry infographics\nRSHA ‘closing the loop’\n   Have a repeatable, \nscaleable method for \nassessing mobile plant\nKey research findings\nResearch objectives\n-regulators, manufacturers,  \npolicy makers, workers etc\n- customised reports about cotton,  \ndairy, grain & sheep farms\n\n6\nMobile plant safety on farm: \npractices and perceptions\nSnapshot report, May 2024\nAgHealth Australia data 2001-2020 [134]\nFigure 1. Farm fatality data over 20 years\nAustralian agriculture has the highest work-related \nfatality rate of any industry (Safe Work Australia) and \nmobile plant is the lead agent for fatalities on farm [134].\nMobile plant refers to a diverse range of equipment \nand machinery – including tractors, quad bikes, post \nhole diggers and augers – that have some form of self-\npropulsion, are under the direct control of an operator \nand are typically not used on a public road [National \nModel WHS Act and Regulations 2021].\nWhile tractors and quad bikes are the predominate \nagents, one in every 10 fatalities on farm is associated \nwith other mobile plant types (Figure 1).\nPeople’s attitude to safety shapes their behaviour \n[13,180, 335]. Having safety front of mind is important \nfor all farm machinery as even some less common \ninjuries can be extremely traumatic when they happen  \n(with augers, post hole diggers [281], hay baling \nequipment [293] as examples).\nThis snapshot describes practices and perceptions \naround mobile plant safety on Australian farms in 2023. \nThe information comes from research conducted by \nWork Science, including 49 interviews and a survey of \n229 growers.\nWork Science used the Health Belief Model to help \nassimilate interviewees’ perspectives on why people \non farm do, or don’t, adopt safe practices when using \nmobile plant.\nMobile plant fatalities in blue\n ¾ Mobile plant is an essential part of farming. Farms typically used 6 of the 10 plant types asked about in the \n2023 survey.\n ¾ Mobile plant is risky. One in 10 fatalities on Australian farms have been associated with equipment other \nthan tractors and quad bikes.\n ¾ What growers see as the riskiest plant on their farm differs between farms. Post-hole diggers/drivers were \nnominated as the riskiest on 35% of farms and augers on 33% of farms.\n ¾ Most growers (90%) believe others on farm expect a high standard of safety when risky plant is used.\n ¾ Work practices support safe operation of the riskiest equipment. Many check equipment before use (90%), \nrestrict who can use it (66%) and give safety briefings before starting high risk jobs (73%).\n ¾ People see the big risks to safety as time pressures, fatigue, distraction, lack of operator competency, \nmachinery neglect and machinery modification. \nIndustry-wide safer use of mobile plant is likely to require a specific focus on each type. The most effective \nchanges will occur at different parts of the whole safety system for that particular equipment. The case study of \naugers provides an example of this.\nRSHA| Mobile Plant Research Pack 2024 7\nFigure 4. Multiple mobile plant used on farms\nA better understanding of what farmers think and do \naround mobile plant safety will help the agricultural \nindustries foster safer behaviours.\nGrowers were asked about 10 different types of mobile \nplant (listed in Figure 2): what was used on the farm, \nhow often, and what they saw as the riskiest.\nEach of the 10 mobile plant types were nominated by at \nleast one of the farms with the equipment as the riskiest \nto operate. The most commonly selected equipment \nwere post-hole diggers/drivers and augers.\nA diverse range of farm businesses contributed to this \ndescription. The farms ranged from 60 to 1,600,000 \nhectares in size, over 80% had livestock, and about two-\nthirds produced a mix of commodities (Figure 3). Most \nwere family farms (95%) and eight were corporate farms. \nFarm focus Farms in \nsurvey\nSize  \n(median)\nWorkers \nat peak \n(median)\nBeef 36 2,200 ha 3 people\nDairy 26 700 ha 7 people\nSheep 12 805 ha 5 people\nBeef-Sheep 24 950 ha 4 people\nCotton-Grain 36 2,000 ha 5 people\nGrain-Sheep 29 1,700 ha 5 people\nLivestock-Crops 63 2,000 ha 5 people\nOther 3 1,800 ha 4 people\nAll 229 1,600 ha 5 people\nFigure 3.

Plant that is seen as the riskiest to operate\n The median workforce at peak was 5 people (range 1 \nto 350), and more than half of the farms (57%) had used \none or more contractors in the previous year.\nFarms typically used six types of mobile plant (Figure 4), \nwith augers, spray booms, planters, slashers and post-\nhole diggers/drivers used on four in every five farms.\nQuestions were then asked about practices associated \nwith use of the riskiest equipment.\nWho used the plant on farm was often restricted (66% \nof farms) and it was typically checked before use (93% of \nfarms)  (Figure 5). (Figure 6, pages 4-5, show this for each \nmobile plant type.) \nNote Cotton gins not reported as used on less than 10% farms.\n8\nFigure 5. Practices associated with the riskiest mobile plant\nFigure 7. Increase in indicators of safe practice\nGrowers generally felt that others on the farm expect \nthe highest safety standard when that particular piece \nof mobile plant is used (90% of farms), and that workers \nregularly tell each other about changes in conditions that \ncould affect how it is used (73% of farms).\nNotably 8% of growers had themselves been in a \nsituation where they felt their level of knowledge or skill \nhad been inadequate. This was associated with seven \ndifferent plant types, including post-hole diggers/drivers \n(for 7 growers) and augers (for 4 growers).\nFifteen percent of growers had mobile plant, which they \nidentified as the most risky, that had  been modified \nfor use on their property. Again augers were a feature \nhaving been changed on 14 farms.\n2011 survey of 628 farmers [329]\nWhile it is not possible to say whether modifications \nwere to improve safety or utility, it is of note that a \nperson who modifies plant has the same obligation \nas a designer and a manufacturer under the WHS \nRegulations.\nThe Work Science survey suggests an upward trend in \nsafe practices on farm when it is compared to a 2011 \nsurvey of 628 farms (Figure 7). While indicators such as \nregular hazard inspections, safety briefings and safety \nmanagement plans are more prevalent, it is important to \nnote that none have been universally adopted.\n\nRSHA| Mobile Plant Research Pack 2024 9\nPlanter\nOne farm nominated \na planter as their riskiest \n equipment, and it was used \nless than monthly.\nAuger\n On the 75 farms that see as riskiest:\nSpray boom\n On the 4 farms that see as riskiest:\nSlasher\n On the 14 farms that see as riskiest:\nPost-hole digger / driver\n On the 79 farms that see as riskiest:\nFigure 6.

More than two-thirds of interviewees were \nfrom farms (Figure 10) and 80% of them were in the \ngrains, beef or cotton industries.\nInterview responses were framed in terms of the Health \nBelief Model.\nThe Health Belief Model examines why people do or \ndon’t adopt preventative practices – and over the last 60 \nyears has been applied to issues from breast screening \nto covid vaccination. The model is used to design \nmessaging that aligns with the beliefs and attitudes of \nthe target audience [320].\nIn this model, whether people take preventative action \ndepends on the severity of the consequences, how \nsusceptible they see themselves, their capacity to do \nsomething, and the benefits and barriers of acting \n(Figure 11).\nThe perceived benefits and barriers are typically strong \npredictors of behaviour change [343].\nFigure 12. Unsafe practices that concern interviewees\nFigure 10. Two-thirds of the \n49 interviewees were from farms\nA 2006 study of Australian farmers’ attitudes to health \nand safety [314] found that:\n• A prevailing attitude was ‘it won’t happen to me’ - \nwhere farmers did not feel their family or lifestyle \nwas at risk of serious repercussions.\n• Farmers believed that the barriers (largely cost \nand time) outweighed the benefits of changing \nbehaviour– and many farmers had difficulty \nidentifying particular benefits of making a change.\nIn contrast, the 2023 Work Science study shows that \npotential for injury associated with mobile plant use \ndoes concern many in the agricultural industry - with \nrepeated mentions of several types of unsafe practices \nby interviewees (Figure 12).\nTime pressures and fatigue were also felt to be \nimportant contributing factors to unsafe operation by \ninterviewees (43% and 26% respectively).  \nA feeling of being vulnerable / threatened (‘it could \nhappen to me’) is one of the pre-conditions for taking \naction under the Health Belief Model.\nHowever the types of barriers mentioned by \ninterviewees in 2023 may still outweigh the perceived \nbenefits of making change (Figure 13).\nBehaviour change opportunities\n12\nFigure 11.

Safety at the time of mobile plant use \nis a function of the whole system\nSystem supporting safe use\nWorkplaces are legally obliged to manage \nhazards so that people are not harmed. The \nlikelihood and severity of injury are influenced \nby many factors, some being controlled on \nfarm (through machinery checks, purchase \ndecisions, safety briefings etc) and some \nexternally (such as regulation, access to \ntraining, and integration of safety features in \nequipment design).\nWork Science recommended a Rasmussen-\ninspired model as a way of systematically \nconsidering risk controls across the entire \nsafety system for specific mobile plant (Figure \n14). This framing helps identify points of \nconsideration.\nFor example the difference in safety \nmanagement systems for family and \ncorporate farms becomes immediately \nobvious. On corporate farms, directors set \nthe safety standards implemented by managers and \nformalised in standard operating procedures. On family \nfarms - such as the 218 farms in the grower survey - \nthese responsibilities often sit with one individual, in \nwhich case changes in attitude and behaviour will be \nhighly dependent on interaction with significant others \n(such as peer groups and family) or a near miss event \n[180, 328] (Figure 15).\nRSHA is using the Rasmussen model to map risk controls \nacross the safety system for augers - given that they are \non four in every 5 farms, typically used multiple times a \nmonth and are regarded by many growers as the riskiest \nequipment to oeprate.\nThis appraisal will determine its effectiveness as a tool \nfor industry to identify gaps and strengthen safety \nmessaging for farm.\nFigure 15.

scan \nfor mobile plant\nSnapshot report, May 2024\nAim\nOne of the outputs of the mobile plant research was to \nhave a repeatable, scaleable method for examining the \nwhole safety system for a specific type of mobile plant \nwith a view to identifying practical opportunities to \ninfluence its safe use on farm.\nApproach\nA Rasmussen-inspired model recommended by Work \nScience was used to systematically consider what factors \nshape safe use of mobile plant across the whole safety \nsystem (as per diagram on page 20).\nThe safety system scan involved the following steps:\n• Review of available injury burden data for machinery \ncategory and other contextual data to understand \nthe risk profile. \n• Lines of enquiry at different levels of the system \n(end users, suppliers, designers etc) to build \nunderstanding of the safety risks for the equipment \nand factors that influence its safe supply and use.\n• Consultation with an independent subject matter \nexpert for futher information and clarification.\n• Working Group discussions to identify gaps and \nopportunities for influencing safety on farm.\nMobile augers were used as a case study for the safety \nsystem scan (findings reported separately, see page 21).\nResults and discussion\nDevelopment of the safety system scan and mobile \nauger case study took about 10 days work over three \nmonths. It provided a good overview of the whole \nsafety system for mobile augers and helped fast-track to \nknowledge gaps and opportunities.\nIn this case the scan involved an RSHA Working Group \ninterview with a subject matter expert, reflection and \nfollow-up of some key information gaps via the SME, \nthen group discussion and exploration of next steps.\nThe method would be highly repeatable and could be \napplied to other mobile plant types and potentially other \nWHS considerations more broadly.\nSome observations about using the scan in the case \nstudy:\n• Specifying the equipment and scope of the \nenquiry (eg mobile and not fixed augers) proved \nan important first step as it very much shaped \nidentification of the issues and their follow-up.\n• Who acts as SME is important. The process was very \nefficient in this case as the SME had a lot of practical, \nfarm-related experiences and was willing to explore \nideas (without being locked on to an organisational \nposition). Discussions were open, honest and \nexploratory.\n• The Working Group members provided important \ndepth and direction by opening the discussion to \nhow augers are used within their industries.\n• The researcher leading the enquiry needs to be \nboth agile and thoughtful to clarify what is known, \nidentify what isn’t and deliberate on what leads to \nfollow.\nRecommendations\nConsider using the Rasmussen-inspired safety system \nscan to fast-track factors in the whole safety system that \nmay be influencing safety on farm (for different types of \nmobile plant and potentially other aspects of WHS).\n ¾ A systematic scan of the whole safety \nsystem for specific mobile plant was able \nto identify opportunities for industry to \nimprove safe use of the equipment on farm.\n\nRSHA| Mobile Plant Research Pack 2024 20\nContext\n1.

This concern is well-founded with recent \nexamples of both entanglement and fatalities.\nThere is a significant body of knowledge about hazards \nrelating to augers and controlling the risks on farm, \nintegrated into resources such as Farmsafe Australia’s \nToolbox Talks.\nThe aim of this case study was to conduct a scan of the \nwhole safety system to identify whether there were also \npractical opportunities to boost the safe use of mobile \naugers through off farm interventions.\nMethod\nA Rasmussen-inspired approach, developed as part \nof the RSHA04 mobile plant project, was used for the \nsafety system scan.\nThe scope of the scan was mobile augers (including \nsmaller pencil augers) as conveyer and fixed auger types, \nwhile more complex, are inherently safer.\nThe scan started by interviewing Wayner Baker, a \nsubject matter expert and Chartered Professional \nMechanical Engineer with decades of experience \nproviding OHS advice to farms. From this, the RSHA \nWorking Group identified key areas that emerged as \npoints for influencing safety around augers.\nFurther information about the augers available in \nAustralia and regulations around auger guarding was \nexplored in a desk audit by the subject matter expert. \nThe RSHA04 Mobile Plant Working Group met to discuss \nthe findings and their implications.\nPoints on mobile auger use in agriculture\nMobile augers are used in agriculture to deliver product \nor shift grains or pellets within a farm (for example \nmoving the residual from a bin ready for refill).\nThe volumes and required lift heights vary between \nfarms, and can be large scale for some. Mobile augers \nrange from 8-30 metres in length and from a flow rate \ncapable of shifting a few tonnes to 120 tonnes per hour.\nDespite this range mobile augers are relatively uniform \nin their components and design. They are generally \npowered by a small petrol engine (mounted on the \nauger) or by a connection to the Power Take Off of the \ntractor. There is an exposed screw at the lower end \nwhich moves product up the shaft as it turns. The auger \nsits on two wheels located at the centre of gravity and \ncan be collapsed for transport. Some newer models \nare self-propelled. Bigger mobile augers have different \nfolding mechanisms.\nFatalities and major injuries are in the main due to the \nfeed-in and flight (which have engineering controls that \nmake things safer) as well as a couple of cases where \naugers have collapsed (which means the operator was in \nthe danger zone). \nThe lifetime of a mobile auger is about 30 years. They \nare often used on farm until they become obsolete in \nterms of flow capacity or height, or they wear out. \nAs with many types of machinery, risks to safety increase \nwith age due to structural wear.\nThe case study identified off-farm interventions to \nhelp increase safe use of mobile augers on farm:\n ¾ Featuring appropriate guarding in the selection \nof new equipment at purchase.\n ¾ Having a third-party training tool for the sector \nthat increases confidence in safe use on farm.\n ¾ Increasing awareness of hazards and their \ncontrol in new and older mobile augers.\n\nRSHA| Mobile Plant Research Pack 2024 22\nAuger suppliers and images with flighting guarding \nA new high lift, high capacity auger can cost over \n$100,000 while small secondhand units in good \ncondition might be around $5,000.\nMost people learn to use augers in the farm workplace. \nIt is important that induction and supervision is \nappropriate to ensure people who work on farm \nunderstand the risks and those who use the equipment \nhave the necessary skills.\nOff farm components of the safety system\nThe Australian Standard for machinery guarding \n(AS4024) was designed around industrial machinery \nand does not provide the functionality needed for farm \n(grain cannot flow at a sufficient rate). An agricultural \nIndustry Safety Standard, where a two-guard system \nis used to reduce access, was negotiated in 2009 and \nbecame the accepted practice for the sector - and \neffective in reducing injuries.\nHowever it is now uncertain to what extent the Industry \nSafety Standard is endorsed by the agricultural sector \nin 2024 or what the state and territory regulatory \nauthorities enforce around auger guarding.\nWith considerable consolidation of agricultural \nmachinery manufacturing in recent years, Australian \ndistributors typically support 2-3 brands sourced from \na handful of international companies (mainly Canada \nand the USA). The stock is reassembled by resellers at \nAustralian facilities.\nThe desk top review established that it is possible to \npurchase new augers in Australia with guarding that \nmeets the Industry Safety Standards, but it is not a \nrequisite  (see table). Furthermore, safety or safety \nfeatures are not key design elements communicated \nwithin promotional material.\nDesign safety is guided by the general obligations \nthat exist to duty holders under state, territory and \ncommonwealth workplace safety laws.\nNext steps for consideration\nThe RSHA Working Group identified opportunities to \nhelp control safety risks for augers on farm that could \nbe supported through organisations such as Farmsafe \nAustralia, the state and territory worksafe authorities, \nequipment manufacturers, and the RDCs.\nRecommendations:\n• Industry explores what regulators expect about \nmobile auger guarding.\n• Industry connects with (1) the Tractor and \nMachinery Association of Australia and (2) Australian \nequipment suppliers about featuring Industry Safety \nStandard guarding (and safety more broadly) as a \nselling point. \n• Farmsafe Australia and RDC: (1) encourage growers \nto consider safety features when selecting new \nequipment; and (2) target safety messaging around \nolder equipment (‘if it is in the workplace, it has to \nbe safe’). For example encouraging retrofitting of \nguarding where indicated and increasing awareness \nof hazards associated with structural wear and tear.\n• Industry arranges development of a training/\ninduction resource on safe design and use that \ncan be delivered by suppliers, competent trainers \non farm, or third party providers.

Energy (electricity and diesel) costs for Australian cotton growers are expected\nto continue to increase by 2.9–7.2% annually until 2040. Diesel fuel provides at least 90% of\nthe direct energy harnessed in farms. On average, irrigation accounts for 50–75% of the total\ndirect energy consumption on-farm. An increasing number of alternative irrigation systems,\nfor example, centre pivots and lateral move systems, in the future are expected to lead to\nhighly significant energy costs associated with water pumping and machine operation. On the\nother hand, the costs of renewable energy continue to decrease, providing cotton growers with\nanother option for energy supply. Renewable energy can be used to design the corresponding\nmicrogrids to irrigate cotton farms. The designed renewable microgrids can reduce these cotton\nfarms’ energy consumption costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to develop\ntailor-maderenewablepowerplanningandenergymanagementplansforcotton-farmmicrogrids\nto secure power supply and reduce energy costs. In addition, we seek to optimize the microgrid’s\noperation considering the uncertainty of environmental and demand factors on cotton farms to\nachieve cost savings for cotton stakeholders.\nIn this thesis, the first part presents an optimization model for cotton farm microgrid design,\nwhich explores available renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage options to ensure\nii\na reliable power supply for cotton farms. By using the RES power supply, renewable energy is\noptimally utilized to satisfy the seasonal load demand, and the grid power is used as a backup\npower source. The objectives of optimization include investment cost, operating cost, and a\nsimple payback period. A case study is undertaken using historical energy consumption data\nfrom a cotton farm in Gunnedah, New South Wales, to verify the applicability of the proposed\napproach.\nThe second part of this study presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach to the above\ndesigned cotton farm microgrid to minimize the water pumping operational cost while taking\nfull advantage of renewable energy sources. The reason for using MPC is its ability to handle\nnoise, disturbance, and real-time parameter changes. Microgrids at two different cotton farms\nare used for case studies to validate the proposed MPC methodology.\nThe third part of this study addresses the problem of optimizing cotton farm operating costs\nunder uncertainties. An MPC approach is adopted to maximize the usage of renewable en-\nergy and minimize the overall water pumping cost during the cotton growth and irrigation\nperiod. To deal with the uncertainties in renewable generation, water demand, precipitation\nand evaporation, the operation problem of the cotton farm pumping system is formulated as\na stochastic MPC problem to cater to real-time changes in uncertain weather conditions and\nirrigation demand. Static and dynamic scenario generation-reduction techniques are applied\nto obtain typical scenarios and the corresponding probabilities, which are further applied to\nformulate the stochastic optimization problem to deal with uncertainties.\nKeywords:\niii\nCotton Farm, Microgrid, Battery Energy Storage System, Renewable Energy,\nPlanning and Operation, Optimization, Model Predictive Control, Water Reser-\nvoir, Uncertainty\niv\nThesis Acknowledgements\nFirst, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to my two supervisors, Professor\nLi Li and Professor Jiangfeng Zhang, for their continuous support of my doctoral\nstudiesandresearch.

cotton farm and microgrid\nThe cotton industry is one of Australia’s largest export earners in rural areas and\nprovidesthousandsofjobopportunitiesinAustralia[1]. In2019, morethan10,000\npeople were employed on Australian cotton farms, and cotton growers reported\nthat they spent 93% of their business expenses in [2].\nHowever, cotton cultivation is an energy-intensive industry, and the international\ncotton market is highly competitive and transparent. Therefore, the continuously\nrising energy cost has become a critical barrier to the cotton industry’s devel-\nopment. In addition, conventional energy sources are unsustainable. In the last\ncouple of decades, the prices of fossil fuel and electric grid energy have continued\n2\nto rise, which is the main reason for the rising costs of cotton products.\nOn the other hand, renewable energy is recognized as a cost-effective source of\npower generation. Renewable energy sources (RESs), such as solar, wind, and\nbiomass, have the advantages of abundant forms of energy, less emission, low\nmaintenance cost and lower ecological impact, Thus, they have increasingly been\nused in rural areas. Furthermore, renewable energy technology is more and more\nmature, and the investment cost is continuously reducing. As a result, the de-\nmand for photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage installation in Australia is also\nincreasing. The number of microgrid (MG) systems composed of RESs, energy\nstorage units and traditional energy sources is increasing in the Australian agri-\nculture sector and has brought enormous benefits to agricultural development [1].\nThere are a number of initiatives in Australia to promote the use of MGs in the\ncotton farming industry. For example, the Cotton Research and Development\nCorporation (CRDC) has supported a number of projects focused on the deploy-\nment of MGs in the cotton industry. These projects have aimed to demonstrate\nthe feasibility and benefits of MGs in the context of Australian agriculture, with\nthe goal of encouraging wider adoption of MG technology.\nIn order to take advantage of these abundant natural resources, proper planning\nis essential for ensuring the sustainability of a cotton farm MG, and can help to\n3\nmaximize the benefits of the technology for the cotton farm owners. However,\nthe energy consumption of cotton irrigation is different from residential electricity\nconsumption, as irrigation demand is not constant and occurs seasonally. Irriga-\ntion must match the growth period of cotton. In other words, this study needs to\ndesign a properly sized MG for cotton farms. Too large an MG will increase cap-\nital costs, while too small an MG will not help reduce operating costs. Therefore,\nit is essential to find an optimal size for the MG to accommodate the seasonal\nand high-power demands of cotton farm irrigation pumps. In addition, during the\nnon-irrigation period, the reasonable use of excess energy to shorten the payback\nperiod also needs to be considered.\nAlthough the MG can be equipped with renewable generations to reduce the fossil\nfuel-based energy cost, the overall MG must be properly operated in order to save\nmore energy costs whilst meeting the cotton farm load demand. Furthermore,\nwhen the RES-based MG is properly operated, the RES can be used more effi-\nciently, and more operating costs can be saved. The traditional irrigation method\nof most Australian cotton farmers is to pump groundwater or river water into a\nturkey nest dam and then use gravity (siphon) to flood irrigation into the cotton\nfield [3]. The traditional operation of pumping water to the dam is based on\nthe farmer’s experience, which varies a lot from one person to another. There-\n4\nfore, the unit irrigation energy costs of different cotton farms are also different.\nWhen renewable energy-based MGs are built for these cotton farms, optimized\nMG operation will reduce the unit irrigation energy cost significantly. A variety\nof optimized operation technologies have been adopted to solve energy dispatch\nproblems in order to save operating costs. To further reduce operating costs, ad-\nvanced operation technologies are often required to properly operate the cotton\nfarm MG.\nModel predictive control (MPC) is a control technique that is used to optimize\nthe operation of a system [4]. MPC can also be used to optimize the operation\nof the MG by properly dispatching controllable energy sources. MPC has several\nadvantages over traditional control methods, including its ability to handle com-\nplex systems and constraints, and its ability to anticipate and react to changing\nconditions and disturbances.\nThere are also uncertainty issues to be considered in the optimal operation strate-\ngies of the cotton farm MG. A number of sources of uncertainty can affect the\noperation of cotton farms’ irrigation systems, such as weather conditions, wa-\nter demand for crop growth, and intermittent RES output. These uncertainties\ncan make it difficult to predict irrigation needs accurately and optimize pump\noperation strategies. So, how to optimally operate the cotton farm MG given\n5\nvarious uncertainties coming from PV generation, rainwater, and irrigation de-\nmand is a challenging question. Scenario-based MPC is a control strategy that\ninvolves considering multiple possible future scenarios and choosing the control\naction that is optimal for the most likely scenarios. [5]. In scenario-based MPC,\nthe prediction is based on multiple possible future scenarios, rather than a single\nscenario. The control action is chosen to be optimized based on the occurrence\nprobabilities of each scenario. By considering a range of possible scenarios, the\ncontroller can adapt to changes in the system and provide robust performance\nunder uncertainties. Scenario-based MPC also can optimize the control action\nover a longer time horizon to improve system performance. Thus, scenario-based\nMPC can be applied in cotton farm MG systems to improve the performance of\nMG under uncertain scenarios.\n1.2 Research objectives and overview\nThis thesis aims to optimally design and operate an MG with renewable energy\nsources (e.g., PV, wind turbine, and/or battery storage system) in order to save\nenergy costs and utilize renewable energy for sustainability and environmental\nprotection purposes in Australia cotton farms.\nThe specific research objectives of this thesis are:\n6\n1.

In Australia, 77% of the cotton\nharvest was irrigated in 2016/2017, while the remaining 23% solely relied on rain-\nfall [7]. Most cotton farms are located in Southern, Central, and North-Western\nNSW and Central and Southern Queensland, as cotton plants usually grow in\nzones with summer rainfall of 400–800 mm. Therefore, the traditional Australian\ncotton industry base is located between 45 degrees north latitude and 32 degrees\n11\nsouth latitude [6]. Cotton growers adopt conventional irrigation patterns to irri-\ngate plants during their growing seasons. Fig. 2.1 shows the areas where cotton\nfarms are concentrated in Australia.\nFigure 2.1: Concentrated irrigation map of Australian cotton farms (source from Google map)\n[6]\n2.2 Energy use in the cotton industry\nCotton cultivation is a highly mechanized and high-energy input industry that\nrelies on electrical power, diesel, fertilizers, and water. The CRDC has launched\nprojects to meet the energy challenges of cotton production. On-farm direct\nenergy use means energy is directly consumed on a cotton farm, and the sources\ninclude electricity, diesel, gas or liquefied petroleum gas, etc [8]. In the entire life\n12\ncycle of cotton growing, on-farm direct energy accounts for approximately 10% of\nthetotalenergyconsumptionbycottonplantations. Ofallsources, pumpingwater\ncontributes to approximately 50%–75% of all on-farm direct energy consumption\n[8], which comprises a significant portion of cotton farm costs, whereas adopting\nrenewable energy systems can bring more savings. Fig. 2.2 shows the itemized\naverage energy use percentage per hectare at cotton farms.\nFigure 2.2: Direct on-farm energy usage components and percentage [9]\nThe chart above shows that 50.6% of the total energy is consumed by irrigation,\nwhereas cotton farming practices before and after harvesting account only for\n27.6% of energy consumption on average. The remaining farming processes for\nsoil preparation, plant establishment, in-field pest spraying, in-season cultivation,\nand equipment maintenance account for 21.8% of the total energy consumption.\nTable 2.1 breaks down the individual components pertaining to average annual\nenergy cost by energy source type for on-farm irrigation processes.\n13\nTable 2.1: Average annual irrigation energy cost breakdown by diesel and electricity energy [8],\n[10]\nDiesel Electricity\nPercentage of pumping irrigation 73% 27%\nEnergy usage (per104 m2) 3.2445 (GJ) 1.1755 (GJ)\nConversion factor from per\nunit energy source to GJ\n0.0386 (GJ/L) 0.0036 (GJ/kWh)\nConsumed volume (per104 m2) 83.5364 (L) 326.527 (kWh)\nUnit price 1.5 (AU$/L) 0.26 (AU$/kWh)\nTotal cost 125.3 (AU$/ 104 m2) 84.9 (AU$/ 104 m2)\nCotton farmers are interested in MG investments for better revenue. In order\nto reduce the energy cost of the irrigation system, many studies have proposed\ndifferent methods for retrofitting and optimizing the existing power systems and\nenergy sources at the farms. Examples of these methods are listed as follows:\n• In terms of improving water utilisation from the perspective of horticulture,\nan early work [11] proposes a method to schedule irrigation and increase\nwater-use efficiency. Ref. [12] adopts the Monolayer method to reduce water\nevaporation. Technical and practical suggestions are proposed in [13] to im-\nprove irrigation efficiency, increase farm profits, and minimize environmental\nimpacts through irrigation management; and\n14\n• Water pump performance improvement is also a significant factor in saving\noperational costs. Water pump overhaul or retrofit is a method to improve\npump efficiency. A significant energy saving could be achieved when water\npumps are appropriately operated [14]. Variable speed drives (VSDs) are an\nimportant energy-saving device for water pumps, which provide a variety of\nspeeds so that the pumps can work at optimal rates [15]. Installing power\nfactor correction devices can help electric pumps utilize energy efficiently and\nreduce maximum demand charges for the pumping system [16].\nIn addition, there are several traditional ways to save energy, such as establishing\na reservoir or dam to manage irrigation [17] so that energy can be saved by\npumping water to these storage facilities at cheap electricity tariff periods. Ref.\n[18] provides details to minimize evaporation and seepage and thus reduce the\ncost of water loss. Alternative irrigation systems adopt recent technologies, such\nas lateral move, centre-pivot irrigation systems and drip technology. They are\nused to save energy and improve water-use efficiency [19]–[21].\n2.3 Optimal microgrid investment design for cotton farms\nTo optimally design cotton farm MGs, there have been many different approaches\nand methods in the literature which maximize the economic and social benefits of\n15\nMGs. In recent decades, RES planning optimization techniques have been widely\nadopted in agriculture; for example, advanced solar PV technology is applied\ntaking advantage of grid connection and feed-in tariffs to achieve more incen-\ntives for cotton farms [22]. Ref. [23] proposes a hybrid power system combining\nsolar, wind, and biomass technologies. This hybrid system is designed using a\nmulti-objective optimization model to consider energy demand and renewable en-\nergy resource availability [23]. A methodology for determining the size of energy\nstorage systems in standalone MGs is proposed in [24]. In [25], a sizing method-\nology using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is developed to optimize\nfor multiple objectives in the design of an autonomous MG for a rural area in\nMali, and the results are the trade-off among renewable energy integration, sys-\ntem reliability, and operational cost. Furthermore, a PV-pumped hydro storage\nMG is designed in [26] by considering lifetime benefit and payback period in the\neconomic feasibility study of MGs. The Emerald cotton farm’s RES in Queens-\nland, Australia, is analyzed in [27]. An MG is designed for this farm considering\neconomic feasibility under a RES, and the cost savings are calculated using the\nHOMER software. Ref. [28] conducts an investment analysis of solar energy in a\nhybrid diesel irrigation pumping system in New South Wales, Australia, where the\neconomic feasibility of incorporating solar energy and potential cost savings are\nstudied. Table 2.2 summarizes the related literature on the optimal investment\n16\ndesign methodologies of hybrid renewable energy sources.\nFrom these existing designs, it is noted that current research focuses on grid-\nconnected microgrids (GMGs) and islanded microgrids (IMGs) with renewable\nenergy resources, while the seasonal loads and intermittent nature of renewable\npower are not discussed for the particular MG design in cotton farms. Targeting\nthese problems, Chapter 3 proposes a new MG design method for cotton farms\nconsidering the seasonal usage of water pumps and the intermittent solar and\nwind energy sources. The MG components will be chosen from PV, WT, and\nbattery storage, and the MG will be connected to the utility grid to provide\nadditional power support. The properly sized battery storage plays an essential\nrole in peak demand management, RES power absorption, and load management\nunder a time-varying feed-in tariff (FIT).\n2.4 Optimal microgrid operation for cotton farms\nBased on the aforementioned study, appropriate investment in MG can help cot-\nton farm owners reduce their operational costs. However, only investing in the\nRESs of the MG cannot achieve the most savings in energy costs. MG control\nand operation are important in saving energy costs as well. When the hybrid\nrenewable energy system is combined with optimal operation technology, the re-\n17\nTable 2.2: Microgrid planning methodologies of hybrid renewable energy sources\nMicrogrid componentsTarget of studyNovelty and contributionsMicrogrid typeReference\nPV-Wind-BatteryRural energy of South Africa\nA hybrid power system is simulated; all the\nparts of the hybrid system are designed.\nThe system controller is applied to different\nscenarios.\nIslanded[29]\nPV-Wind-Battery-Diesel Generator\nMinimizing hybrid power system\ninvestment costs in general\nremote areas\nAn approach is proposed for optimal hybrid\npower systems, and the genetic algorithm\n(GA) method is employed to solve the\noptimization problem.\nIslanded[30]\nPV-Wind-Battery-Ultra Capacitor\nOptimization of energy farm\nsizing in Key West, Florida\nA GA approach is used to solve the\noptimization model for a hybrid\nenergy system design for a farm MG\nGrid-connected[31]\n18\nMicrogrid components Target of study Novelty and contributions Microgrid type Reference\nDiesel Generator-PV-Wind-Battery\n-Converter\nRenewable energy source and an\nassumed load simulation in Jntuk\nVizianagram campus\nA hybrid power system model is built,\nand then the HOMER software is used\nwith the metrological data to solve the\noptimization problem.\nIslanded [32]\nPV-Wind-Battery-\nDiesel Generator\nHybrid power system for rural\nmobile base transceiver station\nat Doka-Sharia of Kaduna state,\nNigeria\nA techno-economic analysis is\npresented for a hybrid energy source\nfor a rural area telecommunication\nmobile-base station, and HOMER is\nused to compare two configurations.\nIslanded [33]\nPV-Wind-Battery-\nDiesel Generator\nPerformance comparison of\nlithium-ion and lead-acid battery in\ndifferent micro-grid scenarios\nOptimal models for a islanded MG\nand grid-connection MG are\ndesigned through HOMER software.\nFour different configuration scenarios\nare compared.\nboth [34]\n19\nMicrogrid componentsTarget of studyNovelty and contributionsMicrogrid typeReference\nDiesel Generator-PV-Wind\n-Battery\nRural family’s energy usage\nin Sri Lanka\nHOMER software is adopted\nto simulate the hybrid system\nconfiguration, and the renewable\nenergy size for investment is\ndiscussed.\nIslanded[35]\nPV-Wind-Battery-\nDiesel Generator\nA sizing tool for a renewable energy\nand a case study at Bishopton village\nin Scotland\nAn empirical approach is\nemployed for a hybrid\nenergy system.\nIslanded[36]\nPV-Wind-Battery\nAn MG sizing optimization approach\nfor a PV/wind integrated hybrid energy\nsystem with battery storage\nThe simulated annealing algorithm is utilized\nto obtain an optimum size.\nIslanded[37]\n20\nMicrogrid components Target of study Novelty and contributions Microgrid type Reference\nMicro Turbine-PV-Wind\n-Battery-Grid\nMulti-objective energy\nmanagement of an MG\nMulti-objective particle swarm optimization\nalgorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal\nconfiguration of MG components.\nThe emission reduction value and new operating\ncost can be calculated by this algorithm.\nGrid-connected [38]\nPV-Wind-Battery\nA renewable system to match\nthe distribution load\nThe hybrid energy sources are integrated\nbased on unutilized energy probability,\nrelative excess power generated,\ndeficiency of power supply probability, life\ncycle cost and life cycle unit cost.\nIslanded [39]\nPV-Wind-Hydro-Biogas\nEnergy Storage\nRural community’smrenewable\nenergy source utilization in\ndeveloping countries\nA smart integrated renewable energy system\nis presented which includes multiple\nobjectives of rural area energization.\nGA is used for the RES sizing optimization.\nIslanded [40]\n21\nnewable energy source can be used more efficiently, and more operating costs\ncan be saved. Once the MG planning investment model is established, optimized\noperation plays an important role in the energy-saving irrigation of cotton farms.\n2.4.1 Optimal microgrid operation methodologies\nIn [41], a multi-agent method for MG system operation is proposed, and a model\nincluding several load agents, generator agents, and a single MG control agent is\nestablished. Ref. [42] builds a grid-connected DC MG model and also develops\na practical lithium-ion battery degradation cost model with network constraints\nin order to optimize the battery scheduling of the MG. A method for rule-based\noperating strategies is proposed in [43], which operates the system with different\noperating parameters to maximize the system’s self-sufficiency and net present\nvalue. The work [44] proposes an optimal pump size model for a grid-connected\npump system and designs a closed-loop control operation model for the pump\nsystem to reduce energy costs and improve energy efficiency. The model proposed\nin [45] is embedded in the day-ahead energy management program of MG, and an\noptimal operation plan by minimizing the daily operational cost is evaluated to\nmeet the power demand and thermal comfort requirements. In [46], different types\nof demand response programs (DRP) are modelled based on the price elasticity of\ndemand and customer benefits, and renewable energy (wind and solar) operation\n22\nis simulated to study the impact of intermittent distributed generation devices.\nFor decades, the predictive control technology has been used in many fields (e.g.,\nimproving transient stability performance of power systems [47], energy cost re-\nduction of a building hybrid heating system [48], and control systems of nonlinear\nchemical reactors [49]. However, the above methodologies focus mainly on MG\noperations in residential or industrial areas, and the limited MG operation studies\nfor the agriculture area focus only on improving equipment efficiency and reduc-\ning the water storage loss for the operational cost reduction. There are only very\nlimited studies for optimizing the operation of MG systems in rural Australia to\nimprove the operation efficiency of farm energy systems. The cotton farm MG\nis very different from the ordinary MG because it needs to consider the complex\nwater demand during the cotton growth period. For example, water requirements\ncan vary significantly during specific growing periods. In addition, the amount\nof irrigation water, evaporation and precipitation of the reservoir also need to be\nconsidered. In the operation of MGs, control methods can be very helpful. Gen-\neral control techniques are still popular, such as proportional-integral-derivative\n(PID) controls [50]–[54]. However, they are being replaced by MPC because of\ntheir reliability and stability in handling uncertainties [55]–[59]. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to investigate if MPC can be applied in the operation of cotton farm\nMGs.\n23\n2.4.2 Operating principle of MPC\nThe basic idea of MPC is to build a predictive model, use a cost function to rep-\nresent the behaviour required by the system, and minimize the cost function to\ngenerate actual control commands [60]. The main advantage lies in the feedback\nnature of MPC. In the MPC process, an optimal control problem is solved repeat-\nedly over a moving finite prediction horizon, and only the first control element is\nexecuted after each iteration. In the next sampling interval, the new states of the\nsystem are sent to the prediction model, and the optimization process is repeated.\nIn addition, output feedback and the repeated moving horizon optimization can\nprovide a robust solution against uncertainties caused by external disturbances.\nConsider the example of the cotton farm MG. Excessive water is supplied due to\nthe rainy season or the demand for water is increased due to temperature increas-\ning, which can lead to uncertainties in water demand. In the MPC method, the\nupdated data (e.g., water demand and PV generation) will be used to solve the\noptimization problem over each moving optimization horizon. That is, at timeT,\nthe optimization model is solved over the time period [T, T + m] using the avail-\nable data at timeT. The obtained solution is implemented over a time period [T,\nT + 1]. Then at timeT + 1, new system data will be fed back to the model, and\nthe optimization problem is solved over the new time horizon [T + 1, T + m + 1].\n24\nThen this process is repeated whenT increases.\n2.4.3 Summary of recent research in MPC methodologies\nTable 2.3 shows the research related to MPC, including MG types, main methods,\noptimization objectives and algorithms.\n2.4.4 Limitation of MPC methodology\nWe are particularly interested in the application of MPC to the MG system at\nAustralian cotton farms, where the MG consists of a diesel generator, renewable\ngeneration, and battery storage to supply the water pumping system at cotton\nfarms. In literature, MPC has been applied for pumping systems; for example, a\nwater pumping station is operated using MPC in the energy resource allocation in\n[61]. Classic MPC approaches have been widely applied in the operation of MGs.\nFor instance, MPC is used in [62] for the optimal operation of grid-connected wind\nfarms, which have hydrogen-based ESSs and local load. From the aforementioned\nliterature, the classic MPC can handle the optimization process in each closed-\nloop iteration. However, the irrigation mechanism of cotton farms does not only\noperate in an ideal mode but also faces different natural conditions, such as evap-\noration, rainfall and temperature changes. Consequently, the optimization results\nobtained only by the classic MPC method are inaccurate, and the disturbance\n25\nfrom nature uncertainty needs to be considered. Thus, Chapter 4 aims to propose\nan MPC approach to solve the cotton farm MG operation problem while taking\ninto account the constraints of the Australian cotton growing industry, where the\nGMG and IMG model for a rural MG will be established, and weather condition\nchanges are used to conduct robustness and operating cost analysis.\nTable 2.3: Summary of the MPC methodologies in recent studies\nRef.

In order to reduce the influence of\nuncertainty on the system operation, various methods for dealing with uncertainty\nhave been proposed in the literature. Ref. [74] solves the MG planning problem by\ndecomposing it into an investment master problem and an operation sub-problem;\nin the operation sub-problem, the optimal operation in the worst case under un-\ncertain conditions is calculated. Ref. [75] uses scenario-based techniques to model\nthe uncertainty of PV system and wind turbine output power, load demand fore-\ncast errors, and grid bidding strategy for the optimal energy management of an\nMG. In order to classify the relevant literature on MG uncertainty analysis, Table\n2.4 lists the applications and methods of uncertainty modelling. However, in the\n28\naforementioned studies above, there is no relevant description of the application\nof MPC for reducing agricultural operational costs under the influence of various\nreal-world uncertain conditions, especially for cotton farm irrigation conditions\nthat have multi-input uncertainty parameters, such as cotton farm MG under\nuncertain RES generation and weather changes. Therefore, the motivation of\nChapter 5is to design an optimal MG system operation under uncertainties for\nAustralian cotton farms.\n2.6 Summary\nBased on the aforementioned literature review in this chapter, operational cost\nreduction for cotton farms in Australia can be achieved in the following steps:\n• Through the optimization methodology, and based on the scale of the farm\nsize and the historical data of energy consumption, the investment cost and\nsimple payback period of the cotton farm MG can be planned.\n• Based on optimal control of the MG operation, the utilization rate of RESs\nis improved, and the operational cost can be further reduced.\n• By considering the influence of the uncertainty in the natural environment\nandwaterdemandontheMGoperation, theoptimalMGoperationapproach\n29\ncan be adopted, and the expected value of the operational cost will be more\naccurate and reliable.\nTable 2.4: Review of uncertainty modelling methods and applications\nRef.

With more than 427 thousand hectares\nused to plant cotton among over 1400 cotton farms, the overall revenue in the\ncotton industry hit a record of AU$ 2.3 billion in 2017/2018 [84]. As an industry\nwith high energy demand, the revenue of the cotton industry is highly sensitive\nto energy costs. Therefore, reducing operating costs plays an important role in\nimproving the competitiveness of Australian cotton products. This chapter aims\nto reduce cotton farm energy costs by designing the relevant microgrid (MG)\n32\nequipped with photovoltaic (PV) units, wind turbines (WT) generators, and bat-\ntery storage. In order to design a more suitable MG for cotton farms, this chapter\ntakes operation cost, investment cost and simple payback period as the optimiza-\ntion objectives, and considers the constraints of the cotton farm such as seasonal\nirrigation demand, water reservoir, water evaporation, etc. The underlying prob-\nlem is then transformed into a single-objective optimization problem by summing\nthe normalized objective functions with corresponding weighting factors. Sensi-\ntivity analyses of various key impacting factors, including weighting factors, tariffs\nand weather conditions, are conducted.\nThe Australian cotton farming region is rich in natural resources. The yearly aver-\nage solar global horizontal irradiation is 4.86 kWh/(m2· day), the annual average\nwind speed at 50 m height is 4.2 m/s, and the annual average temperature is 16.04\n°C. In the literature, many studies on renewable energy generation have been pro-\nposed in agricultural areas. For example, Ref. [27] illustrates a standalone MG\ncase study in which a hybrid power supply system was implemented in a cotton\nfarm at Emerald, Queensland, and the optimal design of irrigation pumps in a\ncotton farm was achieved by the software Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy\nResources (HOMER). In [28], an off-grid MG was investigated for a cotton farm\nin Australia, and HOMER was used to obtain the optimal investment results for\n33\nenergy cost reduction. In the case study of [85], thirteen hybrid MG projects were\nevaluated, and a sustainability assessment was performed in terms of the institu-\ntional, technical, environmental, and socio-economic impact on rural Venezuela.\nFurthermore, rural MGs can be divided into two categories per operation mode:\ngrid-connected and off-grid MGs [86]. Several papers present an off-grid MG sys-\ntem based on renewable energy sources (RESs) and conventional energy sources.\nRef. [87] developed a viable MG system including PV, small hydro, battery stor-\nage, and diesel generators for rural electrification in Southern Cameroons. Ref.\n[88] proposed a methodology based on the energy balance evaluation for a given\ndesign period to determine the size of the electrical energy storage in standalone\nsystems. In [89], a hybrid AC/DC off-grid MG planning model was proposed to\nhelp select the best technology for each device from the candidate list.\nGrid-connected MGs are often applied in rural areas. For example, a grid-\nconnected hybrid MG with PV and wind turbine was reported in [90], which\ncan meet the energy needs of 15 residential houses in rural communities in Chile.\nA grid-connected MG was recently established in a remote area of Uttar Pradesh,\nIndia, and the installed PV and battery storage can support the loads in case of\ninsufficient power from the grid [91]. These MG design results are not directly\napplicable to the MG of cotton farms because of the seasonal energy demand of\n34\nwater pumping: water needs to be pumped only during irrigation periods, and\nthere is not any water pumping load at non-irrigation periods. Due to this ex-\ntraordinary characteristic, the scale of the designed MG needs to be appropriately\ndecided for the cotton farm: an MG of a too large size increases the capital cost,\nwhile an MG of a too small size leads to instability issues and does not contribute\nsignificantly to reducing the operational cost. To solve the aforementioned issue,\nthis chapter will study the optimal sizing problem of a cotton farm MG tailored\nto the irrigation characteristics of cotton farms. Furthermore, the charge from the\ngrid for the maximum demand will be modelled to match the actual situation of\nthe Australian cotton industry [92]. In literature, many existing studies minimise\nenergy costs under the time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariff and charge for the max-\nimum demand. For example, an optimal load shifting strategy is presented in [93]\nto minimize the operation cost of the conveyor belt systems of a colliery, and a\nclosed-loop optimal control technique is presented in [94] to reduce the TOU cost\nand maximum demand charges for a water pumping system. Moreover, a multi-\nagent mathematical model is presented in [95] for energy cost reduction through\ndemand-side management. The results show that the proposed method can signif-\nicantly reduce domestic energy consumption. A demand-side management model\nis introduced in [96] for an MG equipped with PV and battery storage to reduce\nresidential energy costs.\n35\nHowever, it is difficult to shift the irrigation pump load for cotton farms, es-\npecially in the water high-demand season in which cotton needs to be irrigated\ncontinuously for at least two to three weeks, and the pumps are kept running\nfor these weeks. To resolve this issue, the most common method is reducing the\nmaximum demand cost by energy storage, which can be considered for power\nmanagement and peak demand reduction in the grid-connected MG system. Ref.\n[97] showed that battery size optimization can ensure a smooth power flow in\nthe MG and reduce peak load demand. Ref. [98] takes advantage of the particle\nswarm optimization method to minimize the MG’s total energy and operating cost\nby optimally adjusting the control variables to satisfy various constraints. Ref.\n[99] reviewed the control strategies of different types of energy storage devices\nand the corresponding working principles and limitations. Consequently, battery\nstorage can be considered for power management and peak demand reduction in\nthe grid-connected MG system in [100]. By 2020, Australia will have over 15,800\ncotton farms and other agricultural consumers connected to the electricity grid\n[27]. Therefore, the choice of electricity price plays a critical role in shortening the\ninvestment payback period for a grid-connected MG. An electricity cost reduction\ndemand side management model based on MG supply chain and TOU tariff was\nproposed by [101], where end-users are equipped with energy storage. A model\nwas developed in [102] to evaluate the effectiveness of demand response strategies\n36\nusing TOU tariff combined with regional thermal control. Ref. [103] proposed\na model to reduce residential electricity demand by considering price elasticity\nand solar PV power, where Monte Carlo simulation for power flow analysis in\nlow-voltage distribution networks was applied. However, these models have not\nconsidered the situation in that power utility purchases energy from MGs. A\nfeed-in tariff (FIT) is one of the incentive schemes envisaged by the Australian\ngovernment for RES installation. Nevertheless, Australia’s Small-scale Renewable\nEnergy Scheme (SRES) limits PV installation to no more than 100 kW and wind\nsystems to a capacity of no more than 10 kW. In this study, the FIT scheme is\nconsidered in the objective function to reduce operational costs. Meanwhile, FIT\ncan shorten the payback period for the grid-connected MG during off-irrigation\nseasons.\nFor the MG optimization modelling, Ref. [104] developed a model for energy\nstorage management in the distribution network, which can reduce operational\ncosts and improve voltage stability. A stochastic techno-economic MG model was\nproposed in [105] for a rural MG to assess technical design decisions and financial\nconditions. Ref. [106] modelled a hybrid energy system and obtained the optimal\nconfiguration with the help of life cycle cost minimization. Furthermore, Ref.\n[107] established a pump storage model based on the hybrid solar-wind system to\n37\ndo the techno-economic optimization for a rural MG.\nThe aforementioned literature paid attention to the RES integration and man-\nagement method for rural MGs, but none of them discussed the case that both\nseasonal pumping loads and intermittent renewable sources appear simultane-\nously in the same MG. Motivated by the problems mentioned above, this chapter\npresents a new cotton farm MG design method, where the seasonal water pump-\ning demand and intermittent PV and wind power generation are considered. The\nproposed cotton farm MG is structured with PV, WT, and battery storage. In\naddition, the proposed MG is assumed to be connected to the power grid to\nensure enough power supply for irrigation. PV and wind turbines are energy gen-\nerators in this MG, and the battery is essential for energy demand management\nunder time-varying FIT. However, the corresponding investment cost is expensive\nand should not be ignored. Considering all these factors, this study proposes a\nmulti-objective optimization problem to minimize MG’s operational cost, invest-\nment cost, and payback period. A grid-connected MG cotton farm case study is\nsimulated to validate the design results. Furthermore, the impact of numerical\nresearch results in different situations is considered from the perspective of cotton\nfarm stakeholders.\nThe main contributions of this study are given below.\n38\n1. A multi-objective MG optimal design model is proposed for cotton farms\nthat are able to handle seasonal water pumping loads under various weather\nconditions, Australia’s renewable energy policies, electricity prices, and FITs.\n2. The relationships among pump energy consumption, water storage and irri-\ngation water demand during cotton planting cycles are modelled in the MG\ndesign.\n3. Using an actual cotton farm for the case study, the impact of grid electricity\ntariff and FIT on the initial investment and routine operational costs of the\nMG is discussed. The case study also indicates that the capacity of the WT\nshould be limited by 10 kW in order to be economically viable.\nThe rest part of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 introduces the\nRES components of MG for Australian cotton farms and establishes design ob-\njectives and constraints of RESs and cotton irrigation. Details of a case study\nare given in Section 3.3. In Section 3.4, the Yalmip toolbox [108] is used together\nwith MATLAB fmincon optimization tools to solve the normalized multi-objective\nMG optimization problem. The numerical results and the economic impact are\nalso discussed in this chapter. Section 3.5 summarizes the chapter and draws\nconclusions.\n39\n3.2 Optimal design of cotton farm microgrid\nThis section briefly reviews the energy models of key MG components.\nFigure 3.1: Grid-connected microgrid\nFigure 3.1 shows the power balance within the MG. The power of water pumps is\nsupplied by the grid, battery storage, PV and WT. In Figure 3.1, notationPg(t)\nrepresents the amount of power purchased from the grid at timet, i.e., the tth\nhour since the time is sampled each hour;Pm1(t) is the power flowing from the PV\nand WT to the water pump at timet; Pb1(t) denotes the power discharged by the\nbattery at timet to supply the load. Excess power from the PV and WT can be\nsold to the grid or charged to the battery storage. The notationPm2(t) denotes\n40\nFigure 3.2: Cotton farm irrigation model\nthe power flowing from the PV and WT to the battery storage at timet, and\nPm3(t) denotes the excess power from the PV and WT to the grid. When water\npumps are not switched on, the battery also can sell power (denoted byPb2(t))\nto the grid to make a profit. The power flows in this diagram are functions of\ntime t. Hourly samples are taken in the models, and each year consists of 8760\nhours. The water irrigation system of the cotton farm is illustrated in Figure 3.2.\nTo meet the water irrigation demand, pumps lift water from the bore or river\nthrough ditches to turkey nest dams. Then the water will flow from the dams\nto cotton farms by gravity. In Figure 3.2, notation P(pump,k)(t) represents the\nnominal power of thekth pump at timet; andF0(t) denotes the water flow rate\nfrom the dam to cotton field at timet.\n41\n3.2.1 Objective functions\nFrom the system configuration in Figure 3.1, the following equations can express\nthe MG design objective functions.\nfop =\nTX\nt\nβ1(t) · Pg(t) −\nTX\nt\nβ2(t) · [Pm3(t) + Pb2(t)] + C0 (3.1)\nfinvest =\nLX\np=1\nk1p · m1p · x1p +\nMX\nq=1\nk2q · m2q · x2q +\nNX\nr=1\nk3r · m3r · x3r (3.2)\nfpayback = finvest\nCorg − fop\n(3.3)\nIn (3.1),fop represents the annual operational cost of the MG,β1(t) denotes the\ngrid electricity price at timet, T = 8760 is the number of hours in a year,β2(t)\nis the FIT rate at timet (AU$/kWh), andC0 represents the annual maintenance\ncost of the MG. Equation (3.2) calculates the capital investment cost of the MG,\nwhere there areL, M, andN different types of PV panels, WTs and battery stor-\nage, respectively. Notations k1p, m1p, and x1p are the unit price (in AU$/kW),\nrated power (in kW), and the total number of installed panels of thepth type of\nPV, respectively. Symbolsk2q, m2q, andx2q represent the unit price (in AU$/kW),\nrated power (in kW), and the number of installed units of theqth type of WT,\nrespectively. Similarly,k3r, m3r, andx3r are the unit price (in AU$/kWh), single\nunit battery capacity (in kWh), and the total number of installed battery units\n42\nof therth type of battery storage unit. Sincex1p, x2q and x3r represent the MG\nequipment quantity, they need to satisfy integer constraints. Equation (3.3) gives\nthe simple payback period (fpayback), in whichCorg denotes the baseline annual\noperation cost before the installation of the MG. The multi-objective functions in\n(3.1-3.3) can be transformed into a single objective function in (3.4) by weighting\nfactors λ1, λ2, andλ3. However, these objective functions have different magni-\ntudes, so it is convenient to normalize the objectives to obtain an optimal solution\nconsistent with the weighting factor specified by the decision-maker. Therefore,\na weighted summation normalization method is adopted to (3.8) - (3.10). These\nobjectives are normalized by using the true variation intervals of the objective\nfunctions on the Pareto optimal set, andfnorm\nop , fnorm\ninvest and fnorm\npayback represent the\nnormalized fop, finvest and fpayback, respectively;fmin\nop , fmin\ninvest and fmin\npayback are the\nUtopia points satisfyingfmin\nop =fmin\ninvest =fmin\npayback = 0; andfmax\nop , fmax\ninvest andfmax\npayback\nare the Nadir points of the individual objectives, in whichfmax\nop is based on the\nmaximum energy to be purchased to satisfy the irrigation demand;fmax\ninvest and\nfmax\npayback are based on the farm owner maximum investment and payback willing-\nness. Yalmip toolbox is used to solve this optimization problem. The weighting\nfactors λ1, λ2, andλ3 satisfy constraints in (3.8).\nmin(λ1 · fnorm\nop + λ2 · fnorm\ninvest + λ3 · fnorm\npayback) (3.4)\n43\nfnorm\nop = fop − fmin\nop\nfmaxop − fminop\n(3.5)\nfnorm\ninvest = finvest − fmin\ninvest\nfmax\ninvest − fmin\ninvest\n(3.6)\nfnorm\npayback =\nfpayback − fmin\npayback\nfmax\npayback − fmin\npayback\n(3.7)\nλ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 1 (3.8)\n3.2.2 System constraints\nAccording to the power flow in Figure 3.1, Equation (3.9) shows that the pump\nload is supplied by PV, battery storage and utility, while Equation (3.10) shows\nthe power balance from PV and WT:\nPp(t) = Pm1(t) + Pb1(t) + Pg(t) (3.9)\nPm1(t) + Pm2(t) + Pm3(t) = PP V(t) + PW T(t) (3.10)\nwhere:\n• Pp(t) is the total power of water pumps at timet;\n• PP V(t) is the power from the PV at timet; and\n• PW T(t) is power from the WT at timet.\n44\n3.2.3 Battery storage constraints\nThe state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery storage satisfies the following relation\n(3.11) derived from energy balance and is also subject to the boundary constraints\nin (3.12).\nSSOC (t) = SSOC (t − 1) + Pm2(t) − Pb1(t) − Pb2(t)PN\nr=1 m3r · x3r\n(3.11)\nSmin\nsoc ⩽ SSoC (t) ⩽ Smax\nsoc (3.12)\nwhere:\n• Ssoc (t) is the at timet;\n• Smin\nsoc is the minimum bound of and is chosen as 20% in the case study; and\n• Smax\nsoc is the maximum bound of SoC and is taken as 90% in the case study.\n3.2.4 Grid feed-in constraints\nWhen the MG is in grid-connected mode, the feed-in power satisfies the following\nconstraints in (3.13)\nPm3(t) + Pb2(t) ⩽ Q1, ∀t (3.13)\nwhere Q1 denotes the allowed maximum power for grid feed-in.\n45\n3.2.5 PV constraints\nThe power generated from the PV satisfies the following constraints:\nPP V(t) =\nLX\np=1\nx1p · P0\nP V,p(t) (3.14)\nP0\nP V,p(t) ⩽ m1p (kW ) (3.15)\nwhere P0\nP V,p(t) denotes the PV power generation per panel at timet.\n3.2.6 Wind generation constraints\nPower generated by the WTs satisfies the following relations:\nPW T(t) =\nMX\nq=1\nx2q · P0\nW T,q(t) (3.16)\nP0\nW T,q(t) ⩽ m2q (kW ) (3.17)\nMX\nq=1\nm2q · x2q ⩽ 10 (kW ) (3.18)\nwhere P0\nW T,q(t) is the power from a typeq WT at timet. Equation (3.18) rep-\nresents that the total WT capacity installed should be less than 10 kW, which\nis the maximum power of any small-scale wind system allowed by the Australian\ngovernment [109].\n46\n3.2.7 Water storage constraints\nAssume that variable speed drives to control the water pumps, then the water\nstorage reservoir satisfies the following constraints in (3.19) – (3.24):\nSmin ⩽ S(t) ⩽ Smax (3.19)\nS(t) = S(t − 1) +\nnX\nk=1\nPpump,k(t) · Mk − F0(t) − VL(t) + R0(t) (3.20)\nVL(t) = (1 − δ) · D · A\nT (3.21)\nPp(t) =\nnX\nk=0\nPpump,k(t) (3.22)\n0 ⩽ Ppump,k(t) ⩽ Prated\npump,k (3.23)\nF0(t) = D · A\nT1\n(3.24)\nwhere:\n• Smin is the minimum amount of water in the reservoir (ML);\n• Smax is the maximum allowed water volume of the reservoir (ML);\n• S(t) is the amount of water volume in the reservoir at thetth hour (ML);\n• Prated\npump,k is the rated power of thekth pump (kW);\n47\n• Mk is the average amount of water that each kW of input power at the\nkth pump can raise from the water source (e.g. river) to the reservoir (in\nML/kW). That is, thisPpump,k(t) · Mk mega litre of water will be pumped\nfrom the water source to the reservoir once thekth pump is run at its rated\npower, and this value depends on the water head from the water source to\nthe reservoir;\n• D is the annual water demand for cotton irrigation (ML/Ha);\n• A is the size of the irrigated cotton farm (m2);\n• T1 is the total irrigation hours in a year (Hours);\n• VL(t) is the loss of water from evaporation and seepage at timet, andVL(t)\nis calculated by (3.21);\n• δ is the on-farm water use efficiency during the irrigation period [110];δ=80%\nin this study [111];\n• n is the total number of pumps; and\n• R0(t) is average rainfall at thetth hour (ML). As a source of supplementary\nwater, the ratio of annual rainfall to irrigation water can be obtained from\nCRDC publications. For example, the rainfall in 2016 was approximately\n48\n33% of total irrigation [3].\n3.3 Case study\n3.3.1 Basic information\nTable 3.1: Pumps and water storage parameters used in the case study\nItem Value\nPump 1 75,812 kWh\nPump 2 63,551 kWh\nPump 3 12,865 kWh\nFarm size 3 × 106 m2\nAverage pumping head 25 m\nAverage energy consumption of\nlifting 1 ML water to 1-metre\n4.55 kWh/(ML· m)\nAverage irrigation demand 6.5 × 10−4 ML/m2\nMaximum allowed water usage 1,500 ML/year\nReservoir size 1,200 ML\nRainfall 33.33%\nWater-use efficiency 80%\nAverage wind speed at a height of 10-15m 3.42 m/s\nDaily average solar irradiation in 2016 5.02 kWh/m2\nOperation cost @ TOU tariff 49,694 AU$/year\nIn Australia, the average amount of requested water of a cotton field is 6.8× 10−4\nmegalitres (ML) per square meter, and the average area of a cotton farm is 3.05×\n106 square meters [84] in the last decades.

There are three sub-bore pumps in this\nfarm, which are powered by electricity, two with the rated power of 75 kW, and\none with 37 kW [10]. The farm reservoir has a maximum water storage capacity of\n1500 ML. The cotton farm parameters in this study are shown in Table 3.1.

The multi-objective optimization\nmodel is normalized, and the Yalmip optimization solver is applied together with\nthe MATLAB fmincon toolbox to obtain the results. Table 3.8 provides the Base-\nline Case conditions based on the acceptable investment range for Australian\ncotton farmers. The historical data of the water pump energy consumption in\n2016 is used in the case study as a baseline for comparison. The water demand\ndataaretakenfromtheaveragewaterusageofcottonfarmsintheMurray-Darling\nBasin area in 2016, which includes the rainfall as a supplementary water source\naccounting for about 33% [3] of the total irrigation demand.

The PV panel pa-\nrameters are given in Table 3.5; the rated power of each PV panel is 253 W. The\n2 kW, 5 kW and 10 kW WTs from Table 3.6 are available choices. The lithium-\nion battery pack in Table 3.7 is used for the battery storage system, and each\npack is rated as 13.5 kWh. Because the installation of the WT must comply with\nthe Australian small renewable energy scheme, the total installed WT cannot be\ngreater than 10 kW.\n55\nFigure 3.5: Annual energy yield of three types of WTs\nFigure 3.6: Daily generated energy of a 1kW PV panel at the farm location in 2016\n56\nTable 3.9: Baseline Case vs. Optimal Case results\nIndicator Baseline Case Optimal Case\nEnergy purchased\nfrom grid in a year\n152,228 kWh 98,937 kWh\nTOU operation cost AU$ 49,694 AU$ 21,612\nInstalled PV size 0 61.2 kW\nInstalled PV Qty. 0 242\nInstalled WT Qty. 0 10 kW × 1\nInstalled battery 0 135 kWh\nInstalled battery Qty. 0 10\nInvestment cost 0 AU$ 266,500\nFeed-in energy\nin a year\n0 89,613 kWh\nSimple payback period - 9.49 yrs\nFigure 3.7 shows the changes of dam water volume. This curve is drawn based on\nthe power consumption of pumps during the watering period in the cotton farm,\nrainfall and water loss. The total amount of water pumped, irrigation water usage,\nrainfall supplementary and water loss have to meet the maximum dam capacity\nand irrigation demand. It can be seen from Figure 3.7 that when the irrigation\ndemand is 6.5 × 10−4ML/m2, the minimum water volume is 425.6 ML during\nthe irrigation time, the maximum water volume of the dam reaches 532.7 ML,\nand the remaining water after irrigation is 518.4 ML. The amount of water in\nthe dam increases after the start of the pumps and decreases during irrigation.\nThe total amount of water pumped plus rainfall supplementation can satisfy the\n57\ntotal amount of water demand. Meanwhile, the total amount of pumped water is\n1,338 ML, which is also within the limit of 1,500 ML for maximum water usage\npermission. Therefore, the irrigation and water pumping model can be verified to\nsuit the irrigation system, and the total energy consumption of the pumps also\nsatisfies the irrigation demand.\nIn this study, we define the Baseline Case as the current energy system at the\ncotton farm which does not have RESs, and the required energy is supplied by the\npower grid only. Table 3.9 gives the comparison result between the Baseline Case\nand Optimal Case in terms of the MG components, investment cost, operation\ncost, and simple payback period. Optimal Case (λ1 = 0.6, λ2 = 0.2 and λ3 = 0.2)\ninstalledanMGandadoptedTOUtariffandtime-varyingFITin(3.4)tooptimize\nthe configuration. In addition, Optimal Case analyzes the importance of battery\nstorage in the MG and how the battery systems store excess energy and sell it\nback to the grid to maximize the benefit. Figure 3.8 shows that RES generates\nelectricity to supply the water pumps, but it does not have sufficient power to\nmeet the pump load. Consequently, grid power is supplied to meet the shortage.\nMeanwhile, the MG system can sell excess power to the grid during off-peak\nirrigation periods. Since battery storage is an essential part of this study. Battery\nstorage can support water pumping during the irrigation period and transfer the\n58\nenergy back to the grid during the off-peak period of irrigation. Thus, Figure 3.9\nshows the charging and discharging status of the battery over the year. The red\nbar is the excess energy charged to the battery storage from the MG. The magenta\nbars show that the battery storage provides energy to the pumps. During non-\nirrigation periods, the MG charges the battery storage and sells energy back to\nthe grid when the PV stops generating power. Therefore, there are more benefits\nto choosing a time-varying FIT than using a flat-rate FIT. The brown bars in\nFigure 3.9 show the scale of the battery selling energy to the grid during the year.\nFigure 3.7: Water volume curve of the dam on the cotton farm\n59\nFigure 3.8: Microgrid energy distribution in Optimal case\nFigure 3.9: Battery storage charging/discharging status\n60\n3.4.2 Sensitivity analyses\nInthissection, weconductasensitivityanalysisanddiscusstheimpactofdifferent\nfactors on the designed MG system.\nI.

In Scenario 2,\nchoose the weighting factors to beλ1 = 0.2, λ2 = 0.6 and λ3 = 0.2. The\nother system parameters remain intact as the previous Optimal Case. The\nobtained results are shown in Table 3.10. By comparing the three results,\nλ1 = 0.6 in the Optimal Case has the highest preference for operation cost\nminimization, and the MG supplies the majority of the required energy,\nimplying the smallest operation cost. Scenario 1 has λ3 = 0 .6, i.e., the\npayback period has the highest weight, thus the obtained simple payback\nperiod is shorter than the Optimal Case. In Scenario 2, the weighting factor\nfor investment isλ2 = 0.6; therefore, the optimization results show that the\ninvestment cost is lower, but the operation cost is higher than the Baseline\nCase and Scenario 1. Also, the simple payback period of Scenario 2 is the\n62\nshortest in the three simulation cases. Figure 3.10 illustrates the comparison\nof Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 with the Optimal Case. Figure 3.11 shows the\npercentage of the MG components to meet the pumping load.\nII. Impact of different tariffs\nTariff selection is also critical for operating costs and simple payback periods.\nIn this case, two types of tariff and two types of FIT based on the tariffs\nshown in Table 3.2, Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 are adopted to see their effect on\nthe MG configuration and simple payback period. Table 3.11 uses Baseline\nCase as a benchmark and lists the results of four tariff combinations. The\noperating cost of the case without MG is AU$ 49,694 under TOU tariff and\nAU$44,277undertheflatratetariff. ItcanbefoundfromTable3.11thatthe\nshortest simple payback period is 8.15 years, and the smallest investment is\nAU$ 183,300 among the four tariff options. Table 3.11 also illustrates that if\ntheoperatingcostishigher, theinvestmentcostwillbehigher, butthesimple\npayback period is shorter. If the operating cost is lower, the investment cost\nis relatively minor, but the simple payback period will be longer.\n63\nTable 3.11: Optimization results for different tariff combinations\nTime-varying FIT\nbased on TOU Tariff\nFlat-rate FIT\nbased on TOU Tariff\nTime-varying FIT\nbased on Flat-rate Tariff\nFlat-rate FIT\nbased on Flat-rate Tariff\nNumber of PV panels 242 238 234 206\nWT (kW) 1×10 kW 1×10 kW 1×10 kW 1×10 kW\nBattery storage numbers 10 6 7 3\nUnder MG operating cost (AU$/year) 21,612 22,319 20,532 24,422\nInvestment total (AU$) 266,500 223,100 232,700 183,300\nSimple payback period (years) 9.49 8.15 9.80 9.23\n64\nIII.

The power\ngeneration of WTs changes significantly with wind speed. In the previous\ncase study, the average wind speed of the case study cotton farm in 2016 was\n3.42 m/s. The wind speed is scaled up to an average speed of 5 m/s to check\nthe sensitivity of wind speed to the results, and all the parameters are kept\nthe same as in the Optimal Case. The relevant results are listed in the first\ncolumn of Table 3.12. Under the condition of higher wind speed, this system\nhas higher power generation. As seen from Table3.12, the number of solar\n65\npanelsisraisedfrom242unitsto348units, andthenumberofbatterystorage\nis increased from 10 to 20 sets. This is because more operating cost reduction\ncan be achieved with the increased wind speed, which in turn can offset some\ninvestment cost of PV and battery in the system. Now consider the impact\nof solar insulation, and it is assumed that the daily average global exposure\nis increased from 5.02 kWh/m2 to 6.0 kWh/m2 while the wind speed and all\nthe other conditions remain the same as Optimal Case. The corresponding\nMG design results are listed in the second column of Table 3.12. Compared\nwith Optimal Case, the number of solar panels is increased by 3, and the\nnumber of batter units is increased by 4. Therefore, the total investment\nis decreased by AU$ 43,150. The annual power generation is increased by\n28,390.61 kWh; thus, the operating cost is reduced by AU$ 3,709.6, and the\npayback period is 3 months longer.\n3.5 Summary\nThis chapter presents an MG optimal design model for Australian cotton farms.\nThis method formulates the design as a multi-objective optimization problem,\nwhich is subject to various constraints on PV, WT, battery storage, and cotton\nirrigation demand. In the 3× 106 m2 cotton farm case study, a number of different\nMG scenarios are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n66\nSensitivity analysis is also conducted to discuss the impact of weighting factors,\nbattery storage and tariff options on the investment, operation cost and payback\nperiod. Compared with the existing energy consumption of this cotton farm, the\ndesigned MGs can reduce the operating costs by 44.16% to 56.51%, the simple\npayback periods are 8.35 years for Scenario 2 and 9.49 years for the Optimal\nCase, respectively. The grid-connected MG can also sell excess power to the grid\nto speed up the payback period. This case study provides a reference for cotton\nindustry stakeholders to consider RES investment in cotton farms.\n67\nChapter 4\nA Model Predictive Control Approach to\na Water Pumping System in an\nAustralian Cotton Farm Microgrid\n4.1 Introduction\nBased on the results of Chapter 3 on cotton farm MG investment planning, we\nknow that using rich renewable and clean energy sources can significantly save\nenergy costs and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases during high pumping de-\nmand seasons for cotton farms equipped with renewable energy sources (RESs)\nbased MGs [113]. In a typical rural MG system, the key components usually\ninclude a hybrid of traditional energy sources and RESs, for example, diesel gen-\n68\nerators, solar photovoltaic (PV), and wind turbines, which are further aided by\nenergy storage systems [114], and economical operations [115]. The aforemen-\ntioned hybrid energy MG can be optimally operated to efficiently use RES and\nsave more operating costs. In literature, there are many MG optimal operation\ntechnologies that can optimally dispatch energy for cost-saving purposes; for ex-\nample, an MG smart energy management system to optimize the operation with\na matrix real-coded genetic algorithm is presented in [116]; Ref. [117] discusses\nhybrid RES’s control and energy management tenets and introduces different op-\ntimization methodologies applied to hybrid energy systems; fuzzy logic control is\nproposed in [118] for the demand side management of residential electric water\nheater load, and an optimal pump operation schedule is given in [119] for min-\nimizing electricity charges. However, these methods in [116], [118], [119] do not\nhave any feedback to cater for real-time system changes. Indeed, these studies\ndo not observe the output of the control process from the perspective of control\ntheory [4]. Therefore, the robustness and stability of the obtained solutions need\nto be improved by closed-loop control techniques. Note that model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) is a powerful closed-loop optimal control tool [120], and it has\nbeen successfully applied in many MG operation problems [121]. Generally, MPC\nis a control technique that optimizes the system under each moving prediction\nhorizon [122]. After implementing the calculated control solution over a certain\n69\ntime period, the controller iteratively solves the optimization problem over the\nnext prediction horizon to cater for real-time system changes [123]. Therefore,\nany disturbances and uncertain system changes will be taken into account during\nthe MPC optimization iteration process, and robustness can be achieved [124]. In\naddition, robust MPC and stochastic MPC on the relationship between stochastic\nuncertainty and cost function are also proposed in [125]. The implementation of\nrobust MPC through numerical method is overviewed in [126]. Ref. [127] applies\nthe stochastic MPC method to an urban drainage network and observes the effect\nof bias and uncertainty on the performance of MPC.\nInthischapter, weareparticularlyinterestedintheapplicationofMPCtotheMG\nsystem at Australian cotton farms, where the MG consists of a diesel generator,\nrenewable generation, and battery storage to supply the water pumping system at\ncotton farms. In literature, MPC has already been applied for pumping systems;\nfor example, a water pumping station is operated using MPC after introducing\nthe general convergence and robustness of the MPC algorithm in energy resource\nallocation in [61]; and open-loop and closed-loop optimization control method-\nologies are compared to validate MG economic impact and system robustness in\n[128]. However, these investigated water pumping systems are not powered by\nMGs, but by the external main grid only.\nFor a general MG, MPC has also been applied in its operational control. For\n70\ninstance, Ref. [129] applies MPC in the energy management of an MG from the\nperspective of fault mitigation. MPC is used in [62] for the optimal operation of\ngrid-connectedwindfarmswhichhavehydrogen-basedenergystoragesystemsand\nlocal load. A supervised power management strategy system based on the MPC\nmethod is introduced in [130], which is designed for a stand-alone DC MG with\ndistributed power generation, load and battery energy storage, in order to solve\nthe optimization problem under operational constraints. In the agriculture sector,\nMPC has been successfully used to control water consumption during irrigation\naccording to soil humidity [131]. Moreover, the key contribution of the control\nsystem of agricultural irrigation systems is irrigation management [132] and water\nuse efficiency [133]. Meanwhile, the reduction of operating costs by configuring\nrural MGs and open-loop control is demonstrated in [134]. Ref. [135] proposes\na method of load shifting to optimize the control of the water pumps to achieve\noperating cost reduction. However, there are quite limited studies and technical\npractices for the optimal operation of the Australian rural MG system to improve\nthe operation efficiency of farm energy systems, especially for cotton cultivation.\nIn particular, there is a lack of studies on the cotton farm MGs, which are very\ndifferent to usual MGs as cotton farm MGs need to consider complicated water\ndemand during the cotton growing period. For instance, water demand changes\nsignificantly during specific growing periods. Moreover, water irrigation, seepage\n71\nand evaporation at both the reservoir and cotton field, and precipitation also need\nto be considered. Therefore, this chapter aims to minimize the Australian cot-\nton farm MG operating cost by proposing an MPC approach considering all the\nabove-mentioned cotton-specific water demand constraints. Grid-connected and\noff-grid operations will be modelled within this MPC model. The benefits of this\nMPC approach will also be demonstrated when disturbances from rainfall and\nhigh water evaporation are present.\nThe main contributions of this study are briefed below.\n• An MPC approach is developed to minimize cotton farm MG operating costs\nunder both the grid-connected and islanded modes. The obtained MPC\nmodel can reduce operating costs by optimally controlling the power flow\nand the water pumps at the cotton farm.\n• The proposed MPC approach is particularly effective in saving operating\ncosts, given complicated disturbances from rainfall and evaporation that sig-\nnificantly affect the water demand load.\n• Real-world data from an Australian cotton farm is applied in the case study,\nand the obtained results not only show the cost savings under grid-connected\nand islanded MG operational modes but also demonstrate maximized renew-\nable energy utilization rates.\n72\nThe following sections are laid out as follows. In Section 4.2, the MPC models\nof the cotton farm MG are presented for both the grid-connected and islanded\nmodes. The closed-loop MPC algorithm is also explained. Section 4.3 and Section\n4.4 give detailed case studies to validate the proposed MPC algorithm. Finally,\nconclusions are provided in Section 4.5.\n4.2 A control model for cotton farm MG operation\nThe following assumptions are needed in the MG modelling. The objective is to\nminimize the operating cost of the water irrigation system at the cotton farm.\nThe irrigation system includes several pumps which pump water to a reservoir,\nand water flows from the reservoir to the cotton field by gravity. Thus, we only\nneed to control the water pumps properly to save energy costs. These pumps are\npowered by grid power under grid-connection mode and can also be powered by\ndiesel generators and clean energy such as solar PVs. To minimize the irrigation\ncost of the cotton farm under various uncertainties and disturbances from wa-\nter evaporation, precipitation and seepage, the MPC method is chosen. MPC is\nbased on the principle of feedback control, and its iterative process can predict\nthe disturbance factors. In actual cotton farms, weather can significantly impact\nirrigation activity. Therefore, the advantage of MPC against open-loop optimiza-\ntion is that it can respond to weather changes to achieve the purpose of energy\n73\nsaving and cost reduction. The model’s flow chart is presented in Figure 4.1.\nFigure 4.1: MPC concept block\n4.2.1 MPC loops for the hybrid energy system\nThebasicMPCclosed-loopmethodisshowninFigure4.2. InthesystemofFigure\n4.2, the optimal control model is solved over a moving time horizon, which is up-\ndated periodically to provide feedback and real-time system parameters changes,\n74\nsuch as renewable power generation changes and demand changes. The feedback\nmechanism can ensure timely correction of the optimal controller to achieve a\nstable solution against disturbances such as rainfalls and evaporation to be con-\nsidered in this section. The following variables are defined for the Figure 4.2:\n• Input: It is the control input of the hybrid system, which is obtained from\nthe Optimizer, such as the on/off status of each water pump.\n• Output: It is the output of the hybrid system, e.g., the water volume.\n• Measured-output: It is the signal that is directly measured from the hybrid\nsystem. It is sent to the Prediction Model to predict the future output.\n• Future output: It is the predicted response of the hybrid system over a future\ntime horizon, which will be sent to the Optimizer.\nFigure 4.2: MPC closed-loop model\n75\n4.2.2 Water balance model\nThe water irrigation system is shown in Figure 4.3. Water inflow brought by\npumps and precipitation needs to be balanced with the outflow caused by both\nirrigation needs and evaporation. The corresponding water balance model can be\ngiven below.\nV (t + 1) = V (t) + Vinflow (t) − Voutflow (t) (4.1)\nVinflow (t) =\nLX\ni=1\nui(t) · Prate,i · ∆t\nEcon,i · Hi\n+\nLind\nX\ni=1\nuind\ni (t) · Pind\nrate,i · ∆t\nEind\ncon,i · Hind\ni\n+ VR_res(t) (4.2)\nVoutflow (t) = Vr2l(t) + VL_res(t) (4.3)\nui(t) (or uind\ni (t)) =\n\n\n\n0, when pump is off\n1, when pump is on\nt = 1, . . . , T\n(4.4)\ns.t.\nVlower ≤ V (t) ≤ Vupper (4.5)\n0 ≤\nLX\ni=1\nui(t) · Prate,i · ∆t\nEcon,i · Hi\n+\nLind\nX\ni=1\nuind\ni (t) · Pind\nrate,i · ∆t\nEind\ncon,i · Hind\ni\n≤ Vmax∆t\n24 (4.6)\n76\nFigure 4.3: Farm water storage components and water balance model\nwhere ∆t = 1 h is the sampling time period,t is the time index, and T is the total\nlength of the prediction horizon. NotationV (t) represents the amount of water in\nthe reservoir at thetth hour, andVupper (ML) andVlower (ML) are the upper bound\nand lower bound ofV (t), respectively. Equation (4.1) gives the water balance\nrelation, whereVinflow (t) is the water inflow (in ML) andVoutflow (t) is the water\noutflow (in ML). Equation (4.2) calculatesVinflow (t) as the total amount of water\npumped from all the pumps plus the amount of precipitationVR_res(t); where the\nfirst two items on the right-hand side of (4.2) calculate the corresponding amount\nof water pumped by the MG pumps and the independent pumps beyond the MG,\nrespectively. Here, it is assumed that the farm has two types of pumps; one is\n77\nsupplied by the MG, and the other is called independent pumps, which are not\nsupplied by the MG. In (4.2),Prate,i is the rated power of theith pump controlled\nby the MG;Pind\nrate,i is the rated power of theith independent pump which is not\nsupplied by the MG but by either the grid or diesel generators;Econ,i and Eind\ncon,i\nare both equal to 4.55 kWh/m [136] which represent the energy needed to pump\n1 ML of water for one meter of height for the two types of pumps;Hi and Hind\ni\nare the water heads (in meters) of the two types of pumps, andL and Lind are the\ntotal numbers of pumps in these two types of pumps. Equation (4.3) calculates\nthe outflow as the sum of water flow to the cotton field by gravity (i.e.,Vr2l(t) in\nML) and the water lossVL_res(t) (ML) due to evaporation and seepage. Notations\nui(t) and uind\ni (t) in (4.4) are the binary on/off switching status control variables.\nIn (4.5), Vmax denotes the maximum water volume allowed per 24 hours to be\ncollected from the water source (e.g., river or borehole) [137].

Typically,\nthe hybrid-power MG system integrates renewable energy sources such as solar\nandwindwithconventionalenergygenerators(e.g., utilitygridordieselgenerator)\nto provide electric power, and excess electricity can be either fed into the grid or\nstored in batteries for energy storage. Figure 4.4 shows a configuration of the grid-\nconnected hybrid-power MG, and Figure 4.5 shows the islanded hybrid-power MG\nconfiguration.\nFigure 4.4: Grid-connected hybrid-power MG configuration\nI. Grid-connected MG model\nFrom Figure 4.4, a diesel generator should not be used in a grid-connected\n79\nFigure 4.5: Islanded hybrid-power MG configuration\nMG due to its high cost.

Islanded microgrid model\nEquation (4.12) demonstrates the power balance model for the islanded MG\nwhich is based on Figure 4.5. The diesel generator can supply the power\nneeded when the renewable energy generation is less than the required power.\nPpv(t) + Pdg(t) + Pdisch(t) − Pch(t) =\nLX\ni=1\nui(t) · Prate,i (4.12)\ns.t.\nPpv(t) + Pdisch(t) − Pch(t) ≥ 0 (4.13)\nwhere Pdg(t) is the power from the diesel generator, andPch(t) and Pdisch(t)\nare the charging and discharging power of the battery storage at thetth hour.\nAs it is not economical to charge the battery from the diesel generator, the\nconstraint in (4.13) ensures the unidirectional power flow from the DC to\nAC bus.\n81\nIII. Battery storage model\nBattery packs are chosen as the energy storage of the MG. The battery\nstate-of-charge (SOC) can be expressed by (4.14), and the SOC constraint is\nexpressed as (4.15). Eqs. (4.16-4.17) ensures the battery cannot charge and\ndischarge simultaneously.\nSSOC (t + 1) = SSOC (t) + Pch(t) · ηch − Pdisch(t)/ηdisch\nCmax\n(4.14)\ns.t.\nSSOC\nmin ≤ SSOC (t) ≤ SSOC\nmax (4.15)\n0 ≤ Pch(t) ≤ αB(t) · Pmax\nch (4.16)\n0 ≤ Pdisch(t) ≤ [1 − αB(t)] · Pmax\ndisch (4.17)\nwhere\n• SSOC (t) is the battery SOC at thetth time;\n• SSOC\nmin is the minimum SOC, which isSSOC\nmin = 20%;\n• SSOC\nmax is the maximum SOC, which isSSOC\nmax = 80%;\n• Cmax is the maximum energy capacity of the battery storage;\n82\n• ηch and ηdisch are charging and discharging efficiencies, respectively;\n• αB(t) is the binary variable which denotes the battery charging status,\nand it equals 1 for charging and 0 otherwise.\n• Pmax\nch and Pmax\ndisch are the maximum charging and discharging power, re-\nspectively.\n4.2.4 Optimization model\nThe cost functionF(t) is defined as follows.

Open-loop optimal control model\nTo minimize the operating cost over the prediction horizon(T) (e.g., 24\n83\nhours), the objective for open-loop optimization is given as (4.20),\nmin\nui,uind\ni\nTX\nt=1\nF(t) (4.20)\nII. Closed-loop optimal control model\nThe objective function for the closed-loop MPC is obtained by updating the\noptimization period in (4.20) to a moving horizon as (4.21),\nmin\nui,uind\ni\nT+mX\nt=1+m\nF(t) (4.21)\nwhere the period[m + 1, ··· , T+ m] is the moving prediction horizon, and\nthe optimization model needs to be solved over each of these moving horizons\nsubject to similar constraints like (4.8) - (4.17) over[m + 1, ··· , T+ m].\n4.3 Case study 1 - MPC simulation on Kensal Green cotton\nfarm\nA case study is carried out to validate the proposed MPC approach.\n84\n4.3.1 Scenario 1. Grid-connected cotton farm (without battery stor-\nage)\nA cotton farm in the southern part of Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia,\nis studied here. The total irrigation area was3 × 106 m2 in 2016. This studied\ncotton farm has two sub-bore pumps with a rated power of 75 kW. The farm also\nhas a 37 kW re-lift pump to lift water from the Mooki river. One of the 75 kW\npumps is directly connected to the grid, and the MG only supplies the other 75\nkW bore pump and the 37 kW re-lift pump. The MG also has a 50.6 kW solar\nsystem [138]. In 2016, the pumping system pumped 1,004 ML water from the\nbore and 247 ML water from the river, while the maximum allowed water intake\nis 30 ML/day in the irrigation season [139]. Table 4.1 lists the cotton farm’s\npumps [140] and water storage parameters [141] used in the case study. The\nstudied cotton farm’s grid-connected MG system includes a RES and an energy\nstorage system (ESS). The load includes an MG-supported pump system and an\nindependent grid-connected pump. Water is pumped into the reservoir from a\nborehole or the Mooki river and irrigates the cotton farm by gravity (see Figure\n4.6). The high irrigation water demand period considered here is about 87 days\nfrom November 2016 to January 2017. As shown in Figure 4.6, the pump control\nsolution needs to optimally identify the switching status of pumps #1, #2 and\n85\n#3 for cost minimization purposes. Rainfall, seepage and evaporation are used as\nexternal disturbances to verify the robustness of this closed-loop MPC strategy,\nwhich will be discussed in the simulation result part.\nFigure 4.6: Grid-connected microgrid simulation model\nI. Baseline Electricity Operating Costs\nTable 4.2 presents the electricity cost of the cotton farm irrigation system\nover the considered 2016 irrigation period (i.e., 11/2016—01/2017).

There are two pumps supplied by the MG and an independent pump #2\n(75 kW) not supplied by the MG.\nb. The pumps need to pump river water or bore water to the reservoir, and\nthen the water flows from the reservoir to the cotton field by gravity.\nc. The load factor is assumed to be one, i.e., reactive power is ignored.\nd. Historical irrigation and pump power consumption data of the cotton farm\nin the 2016 irrigation period (i.e., 11/2016 - 01/2017) are taken, and the\ntotal irrigation period is 87 days.\ne. In the baseline case,VR_res(t) = VL_res(t) = 0 ML, which means that in\nthe baseline case, rainfall, evaporation and seepage losses are ignored.\nIII. Robustness validation in the cotton farm\nThe robustness of the closed-loop MPC is evaluated in this case study. The\nclosed-loop MPC model can compensate for the disturbance within a range\nto ensure the stable operation of the system. In order to demonstrate the\n89\nrobustness of the system under different conditions, two disturbance cases\nare designed to meet the requirements of the case study.\na. The first disturbance is the received rainfall. Rainfall data can be found\nin the Australian Government Bureau of Metrology (BOM). The 30-year\naverage daily rainfall in mm/m2 at the area of this cotton farm [142]. The\ntotal surface area of this reservoir is about105 m2. The 2016 rainfall data\nfrom the BOM are added as a disturbance to the MPC model. Then the\nwater level at the reservoir is increased after the rainfall, and the irrigation\ndemand at the cotton planting area is also decreased. ThenVR_res(t) can\nbe calculated by (4.22), and (4.23) gives the rainwater received by the\ncotton planting area.\nVR_res(t) = Rdata(t) · Zres · 10−6 (4.22)\nVR_land(t) = Rdata(t) · Zland · 10−6 (4.23)\nwhereRdata(t) (mm/hour)representshourlyprecipitationdatafromBOM;\nZres = 105 (m2) is the surface area of the reservoir, the constant10−6 is\nto convert the precipitation unit from mm/m2 to ML/m2. The notation\nVR_land(t) (mm/h) represents the amount of rainwater received in the\ncotton farm at thetth hour, and Zland = 3 × 106 (m2) is the farmland\narea.\n90\nb. The second type of disturbance is the water loss caused by crop evapo-\ntranspiration, reservoir evaporation and seepage. During extended peri-\nods of hot weather, water loss will increase due to evapotranspiration and\nevaporation. Therefore, based on the relationship between radiation and\nevapotranspiration [143], the disturbance of additional water loss in the\nfarmland caused by radiation,Veva_land, can be expressed by (4.24). In\naddition, the evaporative loss from a farm reservoir can be defined as in\n(4.25) [144]. The water loss from reservoirVL_res(t) is defined as (4.27) .\nPrecipitation and high evapotranspiration/evaporation are both likely to\noccur during the cotton growing cycle.\nVeva_land(t) = 0.408 · (Rrad(t) − Rrad\navg) · Zland · 10−6 (4.24)\nVeva_res(t) = 0.67 · Epan · Zres · 10−6\nThr\n(4.25)\nVse_res(t) = Vupper · 10%\n8760\n(4.26)\nVL_res(t) = Veva_res(t) + Vse_res(t) (4.27)\n91\nwhere 0.408 is the conversion factor of evaporation volume [143];Rrad(t)\nis the hourly radiation value (MJ/m2/h), and Rrad\navg is the monthly aver-\nage value of radiation, and both values are obtained from BOM. In (4.25),\nVeva_res(t) is the hourly water loss of the reservoir due to evaporation, 0.67\nis the evaporation conversion factor [144];Epan (mm) represents evapora-\ntion from a class A open pan for the period; in this case,Epan is 673.9 mm\nwhich represents the summation of the mean monthly pan evaporation of\nNovember, December in 2019 and January in 2020 [145]; andThr is the\ntotal hours in these three months which is used to convert the total pan\nevaporation to hourly data (e,g.,Thr = 2, 088 h in this study); in (4.26),\nVse_res is the hourly seepage loss of the reservoir, where it is assumed\nthat the annual farm reservoir seepage loss is 10% of the reservoir upper\nbound volume [146]. Considering both the rainy season and hot weather,\nthe water flowing from the reservoir to cotton farmland,Vr2l (t), is defined\nas (4.28)\nVr2l(t) =\n\n\n\n0, if VR_land(t) − Veva_land(t) ≥ Vd0(t)\nVd0(t) − VR_land(t) + Veva_land(t), else\n(4.28)\nwhere Vd0(t) is the irrigation water demand.\n92\n4.3.2 Scenario 2. Islanded MG with battery storage\nThe studied cotton farm has not yet installed battery storage. Nevertheless, the\nfarm owner wants to go off-grid with a battery storage system in the future [147].\nTable 4.3: Parameters of islanded MG case study\nItems Values\nEnergy coefficient (σ) 0.2417 L(Diesel)/kW h\nAverage diesel consumption\nof lifting 1 ML water per meter 1.1L/(ML · m)\nAverage diesel price in 2016 1.15 AU$/L\nBattery storage capacity 20 kW h\nRated power of the battery\n(charge/discharge) 10 kW\nI. Baseline of the islanded microgrid system\nIn this baseline case, we use the parameters in Table 1 and replace the grid\npower supply with diesel generators without battery storage, and the owner\nmanually controls all three pumps. Operating cost is the cost of diesel fuel\nconsumption.\nII. Islanded microgrid with battery storage via MPC\nIt is assumed that a 20 kWh battery storage is added to this islanded MG\n93\nsystem, and the impact on operating cost is analyzed. Figure 4.7 shows the\nislanded MG system of the cotton farm composed of PV, battery storage,\nand diesel generator. Electric pump #1 (75 kW) and electric pump #3 (37\nkW) are the loads to be driven by this system. Pump #2 (75 kW) is driven\nby a diesel engine directly, and the diesel consumption of the 75 kW pump\nmotor is 18.13 L/h. The pumping system operating costs are only diesel\nconsumption. System operating cost can be optimized by controlling the\non-off state of the three pumps. The parameters used are shown in Table\n4.3.\nFigure 4.7: Islanded microgrid simulation model\n94\n4.3.3 Results and discussions\nTo validate the proposed MPC approach, grid-connected and islanded MG oper-\national modes are considered here. The whole irrigation season is 87 days only;\ntherefore, the MPC approach is compared with the baseline case over this whole\nirrigation period. The above 87 days are sampled each hour, and the total con-\ntrol period is 2088 hours. The baseline data are found from the 2016 historical\nirrigation data from a cotton farm at Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia\nI. Comparison of simulation results of MPC with Baseline\nThis section compares manual control (baseline) with the open-loop and\nclosed-loop MPC solutions under grid-connected and islanded conditions,\nwhere we assume the same water irrigation demand for these different cases.\nThe open-loop solution is derived from (4.20) over the first 24 hours. The\nMPC solution is also derived for the same 24 hours, but its component is\nderived by iteratively solving the optimization problem over the moving 24\nhours horizons. Figure 4.8 shows the changes of the reservoir water volume\nunder baseline and MPC within the prediction horizon (24 hours); the base-\nline curve shows that the water level is decreasing, while the MPC curves\nkeep the water level around 500 ML. Table 4.4 shows the operating cost\n95\nand the volume of water pumped for manual control, grid-connected and\nislanded open-loop optimization and MPC approach to control water pumps\nwithin 24 hours. The baseline case has the cheapest operating cost, i.e.,\nAU$ 399.5. And because the baseline case has only pump #1 working in\nthe first 24 hours, the reservoir water is dropped to 495.8 ML. The oper-\nating costs of grid-connected and islanded MPCs are AU$ 411.61 and AU$\n408.37, respectively, because MPC has predicted the water demand after\nthe first 24 hours and can provide better control. The open-loop solution\nof grid-connected and islanded MGs has a higher operational cost than the\ncorresponding MPC solutions, and their remaining reservoir water volume is\nalso lower than MPC.\nFigure 4.8: Reservoir water volume changes in the baseline, grid-connected and islanded cases\nII. Comparison of results in different scenarios of grid-connected MG\n96\nTable 4.4: Comparison of each pumping control mode in 24 hours\nTotal operating cost\n(AU$)\nPumped water\n(ML)\nBaseline 399.5 12.30\nGrid-connected open-loop 429.61 14.7\nGrid-connected MPC 411.61 18.38\nIslanded open-loop 429.78 16.10\nIslanded MPC 408.378 17.46\nThis section compares the MPC and its robustness in the different scenarios\ndefined in Section 4.3. The comparison includes the pumping volume and\noperating costs for the following scenarios in the 87-day irrigation period:\na The manual control models.\nb The MPC model without disturbance.\nc The MPC model with rainy season disturbance.\nd The MPC model with both the rainfall and high evaporation season dis-\nturbance.\n• Case i. Baseline case: The baseline case is the existing manual con-\ntrol result, which is calculated from the historical water pump power\n97\nconsumption data, water head, and the volume of pumped water. The\nmanual operation is controlled based on the farmer’s personal experi-\nence. The total baseline operating cost is AU$ 39,580 over the whole\nirrigation period, and 1,180.7 ML water is pumped within this period.\n• Case ii. MPC – without disturbance: Now consider the case of\nthe MPC approach where disturbances from rain and evaporation are\nignored. The MPC optimization horizon is[m, m+ 24], and the solution\nis recalculated for eachm = 1, ··· , 2088. The real-time measured reser-\nvoir water level is fed back to the MPC controller as the initial reservoir\nwater level for each optimization period. Figure 4.9 shows the obtained\nreservoir water volume under this closed-loop MPC solution. By this\nMPC approach, the operating cost can be reduced while maintaining\nproperly the reservoir water level within an acceptable range. The re-\nsults are shown in Table 4.6, where the total operating cost under MPC\nis AU$ 27,556 for the whole irrigation period, which is AU$ 12,023.5\nlower than the baseline.\n• Case iii. MPC – with rain season disturbance: Now consider the\ndisturbance caused by rain and precipitation data from November 2016\nto January 2017 is considered. During the considered period, there were\n98\nthree occurrences of heavy rainfalls which brought significant changes\nto the water level of the reservoir. For example, from December 23\nto December 24, 2016 (i.e., 1300th to 1315th hours in Figure 4.9, 41\nmm/m2 precipitation was received which brought 39.28 ML water to\nthe reservoir. Then the MPC solution stops the water pumps during the\n1274th hour to the1399th hour due to the received rainwater, and the\npumps remain to be switched off until the reservoir water level drops to\n500 ML. Due to the additional water contributed by the rainy season,\nthe operating cost during the whole irrigation period is A$16,019.5 (e.g.,\n40.47%) lower than the baseline period which is calculated from Table\n4.6.\n• Case iv. MPC – with rainy and high-evaporation days: In hot\nweather, the hourly evapotranspiration and evaporation are higher than\nthe monthly average, and it is added together with precipitation data to\nthe case study to calculate the MPC solution. The evapotranspiration\nand evaporation data can be calculated based on the hourly radiation\ndata from Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Figure 4.9 shows that after\nhigh evaporation and precipitation disturbances are added to the sys-\ntem, the highest water volume in the reservoir reaches 552.8 ML, and\n99\nthe lowest volume reaches 488.2 ML. However, when the disturbance is\nremoved, the water level still returns to around 500 ML.\nTable 4.5 compares the working hours and operating cost for all three pumps\nunder open-loop and MPC solutions; Table 4.6 presents the pump operating\nhours and costs, along with the amount of water pumped during the entire\nirrigation period; and Figure 4.9 illustrates the reservoir water level under\ndifferent control scenarios.\nTable 4.5: Open-loop optimization and MPC before disturbance 24 hours (1268th -1291st hour)\nresults comparison\nTest cases\nPump #1 75 kW Pump #2 75 kW Pump #3 37 kW Total op-\nerational\nWork\nhours\nWater lift\n(ML)\nWork\nhours\nWater lift\n(ML)\nWork\nhours\nWater lift\n(ML)\ncost\n(AU$)\nCase ii (open-loop) 4 2.13 9 4.79 4 2.71 261.37\nCase ii (MPC) 8 4.25 10 5.32 5 3.89 279.39\nCase iii (open-loop) 4 2.13 9 4.79 4 2.71 261.37\nCase iii (MPC) 5 2.66 2 1.06 1 0.68 103.92\nCase iv (open-loop) 8 4.25 13 6.91 10 6.77 429.4\nCase iv (MPC) 5 2.66 3 1.6 3 2.03 198.31\nThisMPCalgorithmisimplementedusingMATLAB2021bwithIBMCPLEX\n12.10.0 on a laptop with Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 2.11GHz and\n16G RAM. Now we can compare the open-loop and MPC results under the\ndisturbance situations in Table 4.5.

In Case ii, the MPC method has\na higher operational cost than the open-loop solution because the MPC solu-\ntion can predict the next 24 hours, which will have high water demand, and\nconsequently, 3.83 ML more water is pumped than the open-loop solution\nduring the same period. In Case iii, open-loop optimization is not affected\nduring the 1268th − 1291st hour, which has no rainfall. Thus, we can find\nits optimization results are the same as those of Case ii; however, the MPC\nmethod uses predicted information up to1315th hour, which covers one of\nthe rainfall disturbance periods. Therefore, the MPC solution in Case iii has\nAU$ 157.45 lower in operational cost than the open-loop solution. In Case\niv, high evaporation disturbance can affect both MPC and open-loop, but\nthe operating cost of MPC is AU$ 231.09 lower than open-loop operation.\nFrom Table 4.6, the operating cost of Case ii is AU$ 12,024 lower than Case\ni; and in Case iv, 33.6% of annual irrigation operating costs can be saved\nfrom Case i, which implies 20.7% less energy purchased from the grid. The\noperating cost of Case iv is higher than that of Case iii, but AU$ 1,278 is\nlower than that of Case ii. The operating costs of all the MPC solutions are\nless than that of the baseline.\n102\nIII. Comparison of results in different scales of islanded microgrid with\nbattery storage\nIn the case of islanded MG, MPC is designed to reduce the operating cost\nof the islanded MG. In order to show the impact of different scales of MGs\non the cotton farm, it is assumed that the current solar and battery systems\n(denoted as small MG) are increased to four times (denoted as large MG);\nsee also Table 4.7. Figure 4.10 shows the comparison results of baseline and\nMPC with 2 different MG scales (small MG and large MG). From Figure\n4.10, the utilization rate of the MG pumps (Pump #1 and Pump #3) in the\nbaseline is not as high as that of the MPC method; this is because the water\nvolume pumped by the independent pump #2 in the baseline is obviously\ngreater than the amount of water pumped by the small MG or large MG.\nFurthermore, Figure 4.10 shows the percentage of energy utilization. During\nthe 87-day irrigation period of the baseline, solar energy contributed 9%\n(13,820 kWh) of the total energy. However, the use of diesel fuel provided\n91% (133,335.5 kWh) of the total energy. In the MPC-based small MG case,\nthe contribution of solar and diesel energy is 16% and 84%, respectively.\nIn the MPC-based large MG case, solar energy contributes 64%, and diesel\nenergy contributes 36% of the total energy.\n103\nTable 4.7: Islanded microgrid parameters\nIslanded small MG Islanded large MG\nPV size 50.6 kW 202.4 kW\nBattery capacity 20 kWh 80 kWh\nTable 4.8: Computation details of the case study\nNumber of vari-\nables per iteration\nNumber of constraints\nper iteration\nTotal calculation\ntime (s)\nGrid-connected MPC with-\nout disturbance\n288 161 5,420\nGrid-connected MPC with\nrain disturbance\n288 167 5,711\nGrid-connected MPC with\nrain and evaporation distur-\nbance\n288 184 6,460\nIslanded MPC 264 230 12,380\n104\nFigure 4.10: Islanded MPC and baseline comparison\nFigure 4.11a shows the daily energy production from the small MG com-\nponent to meet the pump load. The main energy for pumping water is\ndiesel, and the 20 kWh battery discharged energy around 0.1%∼ 0.2% of\nthe required energy. In Figure 4.11b, the PV size and battery capacity are\nincreased to 4 times; thus, the energy from diesel power generation decreases\nsignificantly, and the PV energy production is significantly increased. Fur-\nthermore, thebatterydischarges3.1% ∼ 3.2%energytothepumpingsystem,\nand the daily data of battery output energy for one week are shown in Fig-\nure 4.12, where the positive value means discharge and negative one means\ncharge. It can be seen that the battery output of the large MG is notably\n105\nhigher than that of the small MG case. With the MPC approach, the uti-\nlization rate of renewable energy in the small MG case is 7% higher than\nthe baseline under the same PV and battery storage conditions. In Figure\n4.12 only the first 7 days of the irrigation period are shown. This particular\nphase is characterized by high demand for water, and in order to meet this\ndemand, energy from the PV system of the small MG is utilized to power\nthe pumps with no excess power to charge the battery. As a result, there is\nno need for power charging or discharging of the battery on days 1, 5, 6, and\n7. On the other hand, the large MG has the capability to optimize its op-\nerations by utilizing excess energy for charging and discharging the battery\nmore frequently during the same period. This means that the large MG can\ntake advantage of surplus energy to store it in the battery for later use or to\ndischarge it when there is a higher demand for power. The diesel utilization\nrate for the small MG is 91% of the Baseline case during the entire irrigation\nperiod. However, increasing the MG scale to 4 times in the large MG case\ncan make the renewable energy utilization rate reach 64%. Therefore, diesel\nusage is reduced to 36%. The operational cost of the baseline can be ob-\ntained through total energy from case i, and then times diesel coefficient and\nprice from Table 4.3. Table 4.9 shows that the operation cost of the small\nMG under MPC is AU$ 9,738 lower than the baseline, but the water volume\n106\npumped by the small MG under MPC is 4.1 ML lower than the baseline,\nand the reduced volume is compensated by the water stored in the reservoir\nto satisfy the irrigation requirement. In the large MG case, the amount of\nwater pumped is 1 ML lower than that of the small MG, but the operating\ncost is AU$ 4,503 lower than the small MG. The large MG under MPC has\nthe lowest operating cost of AU$ 26,661, while the baseline has the highest\ncost. To solve the considered optimization problems, Table 4.8 presents the\ndetail of the computation size and the calculation time for each simulation.\n(a) Small Microgrid\n(b) Large Microgrid\nFigure 4.11: MPC results comparison of small and large microgrids\n107\nTable 4.9: Operating cost comparison of islanded microgrids\nBaseline\nIslanded small MG\nwith MPC\nIslanded large MG\nwith MPC\nTotal operating cost (AU$) 40,902 31,164 26,661\nPumped water (ML) 1,180.7 1,177.6 1176.6\nFigure 4.12: Small and large MG battery output energy comparison\n108\n4.4 Case study 2 - MPC simulation on Waverleigh cotton\nfarm\nThe Waverleigh cotton farm is located 25 minutes away from Narromine, New\nSouth Wales. This cotton farm installed Australia’s largest solar-diesel MG bore\npumping water pump system in September 2018.\n4.4.1 Waverleigh cotton farm background\nSince the farm is far away from the utility grid, diesel-driven water pumps are the\nmain energy consumption of cotton farms. In September 2018, the REAQUATM\ncompanyinstalleda500kWoff-gridMGsystemforthecottonfarmanduseda250\nkW electric motor to replace the diesel-driven motor for one of the water pumps.\nTherefore, diesel generators and solar energy are seamlessly blended through VSD\nand inverters. In the water flow, all the pumps pump water into the Turkey Nest\nDam, and the water from the dam is used to irrigate crops by gravity which is\nthe same method as the aforementioned case study. The pumping system block is\nshown in Figure 4.13. Table 4.10 shows the Waverleigh cotton farm’s information\nused for the simulation, which is taken from [148]–[150].\nIn this case study, an existing MG system with the designed MPC operation\napproach is simulated, which is based on the 2018-2019 pumped water historical\n109\nFigure 4.13: Pumping system block of the Waverleigh cotton farm\nTable 4.10: Waverleigh cotton farm’s parameters\nItems Values\nMG bore Pump #1 rated power (Prate,1) 250 kW\nIndependent bore Pump #2 rated power (Pind\nrate,1) 250 kW\nFarm area 5 ×106 m2\nBore pump #1 head 90 mTDH\nIndependent bore pump #2 head 90 mTDH\nAverage energy for lifting 1 ML/mTDH 4.55 kWh/ML/mTDH\nAverage water demand (Wirr) 6.5 ×10−4 ML/m2\nMaximum allowed water usage 3500 ML/year\nReservoir capacity 1300 ML\nInstalled solar PV capacity 500 kW\nDiesel price in 2019 (after subsidy) 1.45 AU$/L\n110\n(a) Daily pumped water volume\n(b) Daily energy consumption\nFigure 4.14: Pumped water and energy usage of MG pump #1\n111\ndata of the hybrid energy-based pumping system. Based on the historical analysis\nof the MG bore pumps, combined with the irrigation water demand of5 × 106\nm2 cotton fields, Figure 4.14 shows the energy consumption and pumped water\nvolume of the MG bore pump in a year. Based on [151], we obtained the energy\nconsumption information of the Waverleigh cotton farm under the current oper-\nation mode, which is shown in Table 4.11. Therefore, the manual control mode\nfor the existing MG energy consumption is used as the benchmark. The MG bore\npump pumped 76.8% of the total annual water demand, which is about 2,688 ML.\nThe usage of hybrid-power bore pumps saved 43% of the diesel used for pumping\nwater throughout the year, which is 165,000 litres of diesel, compared with the\nnon-MG case. The average price of diesel in 2019 is AU$ 1.45/L, so the diesel cost\nsaving is AU$ 239,250. Therefore, the total operational cost of the benchmark is\nAU$ 317,145 in 2018-2019.\nTable 4.11: Waverleigh cotton farm’s energy usage benchmark\nItems Values\nTotal water demand 3,500 ML\nTotal diesel consumption 383,721 L\nTotal operational cost of pumping water AU$ 317,145\nI. Scenario 1. MPC simulation for an islanded microgrid without\nbattery storage in Waverleigh cotton farm\n112\nAs all of the pumps in this studied cotton farm use VSD technology, the\ninput energy of the motor can be changed based on demand. Therefore, in\nthe simulation related to VSD pumps, the continuous real value of power is\nadopted for the MG pump #1 input power. The water flow rate in this case\nstudy can be expressed in the following equation:\nQflow = 1000 × ηpump × ηmotor × Pinpwr\ng × ρ × H × 3.6 (4.29)\nwhere Qflow is the pump flow rate (ML/h);Pinpwr is the pump input power\n(kW); g is the gravitational constant (9.81 m/s2); ρ is the density of water\n(1000 kg/m3); H is the head developed by the pump (m);ηpump is the pump\nefficiency (75%); ηmotor is the motor efficiency (90%) [152], and the value\n3.6 is the constant for converting water flow from m3/s to ML/h. In this\nsimulation model, Equation (4.6) can be specified for this cotton farm as:\n0 ≤ u1(t) × Prate,1 × 1\n4.55 × 90 + uind\n1 (t) × Pind\nrate,1 × 1\n4.55 × 90 ≤ Vmax × 1\n24\n(4.30)\n0 ≤ u1(t) ≤ 1 (4.31)\n113\n0 ≤ uind\n1 (t) ≤ 1 (4.32)\nQMG\nflow, 1(t) = u1(t) × Prate,1 (4.33)\nQind\nflow, 1(t) = uind\n1 (t) × Pind\nrate,1 (4.34)\nwhere u1(t) and uind\n1 (t) are the continuous control variable for the MG pump\nand independent pump, respectively. Qflow, 1(t) and Qind\nflow, 1(t) are the wa-\nter flow rate of the MG pump and independent pump, respectively. Conse-\nquently, Equations (4.33) and (4.34) can calculate the pumped water volume\nfrom the MG pump and independent pump. Figure 4.15 shows the hourly\nwater changes of the dam under the MPC for an islanded MG, which is based\non the historical irrigation water demand from 2018 to 2019.\nII. Scenario 2. MPC simulation for an islanded microgrid with bat-\ntery storage in Waverleigh cotton farm\nBased on the situation of the Waverleigh cotton farm that the current MG\ncannot use the excess energy, we consider using a battery ESS to store the\n114\nFigure 4.15: Dam water level changes under the MPC for an islanded microgrid\nexcess energy of the solar system and supply energy to the hybrid-power bore\npump at other times. Due to the wide variety of battery storage, we assume\nthat the TESLATM Powerall + series1 is used in this case, and we perform\na simulation based on the characteristics of Powerwall +.\nTable 4.12: TeslaTM Powerwall+ specifications\nItems Values\nEnergy capacity 13.5 kWh\nContinuous power output (No sun) 7 kW\nFarm area 5 ×106 m2\nInverter efficiency 97.5 %\nStack maximum number 10 unit\n1https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/Powerwall%202_AC_Datasheet_en_AU.pdf\n115\nFigure 4.16: Hourly SoC curve of the 135 kWh battery during the year\nTherefore, we assume that the largest capacity battery storage system is\ninstalled in the farm. Thus Cmax = 135 kWh; Pmax\nch and Pmax\ndisch can be\ndefined as in the following.\nPmax\nch = Pmax\ndisch = 7 × 97.5% × 10 = 68.25kW (4.35)\nThen we add the battery storage system to the scenario 1 simulation model,\nexecute the MPC optimization algorithm, and compare the savings in op-\nerating costs. Figure 4.16 depicts the battery SoC curves for the proposed\ncase study.\n116\n4.4.2 Results and analysis of case study 2\nBased on the historical data of Waverleigh cotton farm’s annual water pump\noperation and PV-based MG operation, this case study simulates two different\nscenarios, which are the islanded MG without battery ESS and islanded MG with\na 135 kWh battery ESS. The simulation of this case study runs for 8760 hours (365\ndays) of the calculation horizon, the time interval is 1 hour, and the prediction\nhorizon is 24 hours.\nFigure 4.17: Operational cost curves of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2\nNow, we compare the simulation results of MPC with the benchmark. The bench-\nmark describes the manual control method currently used at Waverleigh cotton\nfarm. Figure 4.17 shows the average daily operating cost curve comparing scenario\n1 and scenario 2.\n117\nAs shown in Figure 4.17, the daily operating cost of an MG with a battery ESS\nis lower than that of an MG without a battery ESS most of the time. In the\nfirst 4 months, due to the peak irrigation period, the average daily operating cost\nwas around AU$ 2,000. On non-irrigated cotton field days, the operating cost\nwas reduced, and the average daily operating cost was around AU$ 200. Based\non the MG bore pump 1’s historical data at this cotton farm, Figure 4.18 shows\nthe daily energy consumption curves of MG pump 1 in the benchmark, scenario\n1 and scenario 2 during the whole year.\nFigure 4.18: Energy consumption curves of MG pump #1 in 365 days\nTo evaluate the impact of MPC approach on operating costs, Table 4.13 compares\nthe operating costs of the three scenarios.\nIn Table 4.13, the operational cost of the MG without ESS under MPC is AU$\n118\nTable 4.13: Waverleigh cotton farm operating cost comparison (Nov 2018- Oct 2019)\nTotal operational cost\n(AU$)\nTotal pumped water\n(ML)\nBenchmark 317,145 3,488\nScenario 1 (Without ESS) 242,970 3,453\nScenario 2 (With ESS) 234,260 3,296\nFigure 4.19: Dam water volume changes of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 in 365 days\n119\n74,175 lower than the benchmark, and the operational cost of the MG with ESS\nis the lowest of the three scenarios which have AU$ 82,885 savings per year when\ncompared with the benchmark. In this case, the amount of water pumped is\nsimilar between the benchmark and Scenario 1, but the average operating cost\nof all the scenarios is consistent with the benchmark, which is between 70 to 71\nAU$/ML. Figure 4.19 shows the daily dam water volume changes of scenario 1\nand scenario 2. The blue dotted curve shows the dam water volume changes of\nscenario 1 which has no ESS. The water volume slightly decreases in scenario 1\nbecause there is no ESS to store the excess energy, and the dam needs to store\nmore water as there will be less energy available for pumping water, but without\nexceeding the maximum water usage (e.g., 3500 ML/year). For scenario 2 with\nESS, the battery storage can store the excess energy. Thus, only a smaller amount\nof water is needed in the dam, and if needed, more water can be pumped by using\nESS.\n4.5 Summary\nThis chapter introduces an MPC approach to minimize the operating cost for the\nMG of an Australian cotton farm. Disturbance from evaporation, seepage and\nrain is studied to illustrate the robustness of the MPC approach. Case study 1\n120\nshows that in this MPC solution, the grid-connected cotton farm MG under the\nunderlying disturbance can reduce its annual irrigation operating costs by AU$\n13,302, or 33.6%, compared to the Baseline; it consumes the energy of 51,161.5\nkWh, i.e., 20.7% less energy purchased from the grid, which is under climate-\nimpacted conditions in the same year. Meanwhile, in the small islanded MG case,\nthe proposed MPC scheme improves the clean energy utilization rate of 7%. It\nreduces the diesel consumption of 8,467 L, equivalent to saving the operating cost\nof AU$ 9,738, compared with the Baseline of the islanded case. In the case of\nthe large-scale islanded MG, the utilization rate of clean energy is achieved at\n64%, and the operating cost compared with the Baseline is also reduced by AU$\n14,241, i.e., 34.8%. Case study 2 uses another cotton farm’s scenarios to validate\nthe MPC approach that can help farm owners reduce their operational costs under\nthe existing MG. Compared with the benchmark of case study 2, the MG without\nESS can save AU$ 74,175 of the operational costs under MPC which is 23% of\nthe benchmark, and the MG with ESS can achieve 26% operational cost saving\nunder MPC operation.\n121\nChapter 5\nA Scenario-based Stochastic Model\nPredictive Control Approach for\nMicrogrid Operation at an Australian\nCotton Farm Under Uncertainties\n5.1 Introduction\nIn the previous chapter, we introduced the classical MPC approach for MG opera-\ntion to reduce the operational cost of the water pumping system in the cotton farm\nby utilizing RES efficiently. However, different to conventional power generation,\nrenewable energy (such as solar) is always intermittent, which brings significant\nuncertainties to power generation and scheduling [153]. In recent years, more\n122\nand more literature has combined small-scale agricultural RES with traditional\ngenerator sets to establish the MG system, which is considered an emerging way\nto absorb RES on the demand side. Therefore, the operational cost can be re-\nduced by improving the utilization rate of renewable. MPC has advantageous\nfeatures to operate MG owing to its capability to handle uncertainties [154]. Ac-\ncordingly, MPC methods have been widely applied to MG operations. In [155],\nan MPC method using mixed integer linear programming is adopted to solve the\nMG operation problem while satisfying time-varying operational constraints. In\naddition, Ref. [156] proposes an online optimal operation method for combined\ncooling, heating, and power MG systems based on MPC, which compensates for\nprediction errors through two hierarchies of feedback correction. The above stud-\nies emphasize the robustness of MPC and note that uncertainty will affect the\nresults; however, the uncertainties are not modelled. Many studies have discussed\nmethods of generating appropriate scenarios to model uncertainty [157]. A non-\nlinear programming method based on scenario trees is proposed in [158], in order\nto generate a large number of scenarios and then reduce them to a limited num-\nber of discrete matrices as the typical scenario results. Ref. [159] presents a\nstochastic programming method using scenario generation to deal with stochastic\nload and wind power uncertainty. In [160], the energy storage system operation\nscheduling problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model\n123\nbased on the scenario-based method. In addition, there are several studies using\nscenario-based approaches to build stochastic models in MG operation studies. In\n[161], the uncertainty of RES output power and load demand forecast errors are\nmodelled by scenario-based techniques for optimal energy management of MGs.\nA RES stochastic model is adopted in [162], which uses the scenario reduction\nprocess to convert the stochastic problem into many deterministic problems with\ndifferent probabilities and then optimizes each deterministic problem. The above-\nmentioned literature focuses on mathematical algorithms, but the description of\nthe uncertain phenomena and effects in the actual applications is limited.\nOn the other hand, scenario-based stochastic MPC has been applied to smart grid\noperation area [163]. Ref. [164] introduces different classifications of the available\nmethods based on the dynamic characteristics of the system, management of the\nprobabilistic constraints, feasibility, and the properties of convergence. Addition-\nally, Ref. [165] provides an overview of the core concepts related to MPC and\nstochastic optimal control under uncertainties and discusses the disturbance esti-\nmation and the impact of the estimation quality on MPC performance. In [166], a\nscenario-based MPC approach is proposed through a data-driven machine learn-\ning method. Ref. [167] implements a scenario-based MPC controller for heating,\nventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings. Furthermore, a scenario-\n124\nbased model predictive operation control of rural area islanded MG is proposed\nin [168]. Nevertheless, the methods mentioned above do not accurately model the\nuncertainties from different sources and do not compare the impact of different un-\ncertainty models on the optimization results for grid-connected MG and islanded\nMG. Chapter 4 takes advantage of the MPC strategy to minimize the operational\ncost of the cotton farm MG system in Australia. This chapter extends the study\nin Chapter 4 and proposes two uncertainty models (i.e., static scenario-based and\ndynamic scenario-based uncertainty models) to assist the optimal operation of\ncotton farm MG under uncertainty during an irrigation period. Here, the static\nscenario-based uncertainty model refers to the case that the uncertainty dataset\nfor scenario generation and reduction is fixed for the entire irrigation period, and\nthe resultant typical scenarios are used for all the MPC iterations. On the other\nhand, in the dynamic scenario-based uncertainty model, the uncertainty dataset\nwill be dynamically updated for scenario generation and reduction along with the\nmoving time horizon within MPC; consequently, the corresponding typical sce-\nnarios are dynamically updated within each MPC iteration. After deciding the\nuncertainty scenarios using either the static or dynamic scenario-based methods,\na stochastic MPC strategy is proposed for the above two uncertainty models.\nThe demand and weather uncertainties on both grid-connected MG and islanded\nMG are also considered. This study uses the SCENARD toolbox [169] based on\n125\nthe Kantorovich distance [170] method to deal with uncertainties. CPLEX 12.10\nwith MATLAB is used to solve the underlying optimization problems. Therefore,\nthe novelties are to consider both static and dynamic scenario-based uncertainty\nmodels and their impact on both cotton farm grid-connected MG and islanded\nMG. The remaining part of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.2 de-\nscribes the cotton farm MG and scenario-based uncertainty models. Section 5.3\npresents a case study to simulate the proposed methodology based on the actual\ndata from a cotton farm in New South Wales. Section 5.4 discusses the simulation\nresults for each case, and Section 5.5 summarizes the chapter by highlighting the\nsignificant meaning of the main results.\n5.2 MPC of cotton farm microgrids and scenario-based un-\ncertainty modelling\nBased on the current situation of using hybrid RESs and the geographical location\nof general Australian cotton farms, the MG system in Australian cotton farms can\nbe divided into grid-connected MG and islanded MG. Therefore, the following\nassumptions are used to model the studied cotton farm MG. Cotton farms have\ntheir own water storage system for irrigation and tailwater recovery. The pumps\nwill pump water from the bore or river into the reservoir, and the siphon pipes are\n126\nused for the water to flow from the reservoir to irrigate cotton farms by gravity.\nNote that this study does not discuss tailwater recovery. Therefore, the volume\nof irrigation water is the cotton planting water demand, and the water balance\nmodel in Section 5.2.2 is built based on these assumptions. The most popular\nRES in Australian cotton farms is solar PV. Consequently, this study uses PV\nto build the grid-connected MG which allows excess energy to be fed back to the\nutility network. Figure 5.1 shows the working architecture of the grid-connected\nMG in a cotton farm, where the MG river pump or MG bore pump means these\npumps all connected to MG, and the independent pump is the pump that cannot\nbe connected to the MG, but connected to the grid directly. The islanded MG\ncan be built by PV, battery storage, diesel generator, and a dummy load, where\nthe dummy loads refer to loads that can consume excess energy to balance the\ngeneration-load relation. The excess energy can be stored by battery storage or\nabsorbed by the dummy load. Figure 5.2 illustrates the working structure of\nthe islanded MG in a cotton farm, where the load is made of the dummy load,\nMG pumps powered by the MG, and the independent pumps driven by a diesel\nmotor directly. The MPC methodology has an excellent performance in predictive\ncontrol and handling uncertainties, which is suitable for cotton farms challenged\nwith climate change and operational cost reduction and therefore adopted in this\nstudy. As for uncertainty modelling, we take advantage of the scenario-based\n127\napproach to generate and reduce scenarios based on historical data to build the\nstochastic model.\nFigure 5.1: Grid-connected cotton farm microgrid and pumping water system\nFigure 5.2: Islanded cotton farm microgrid and pumping water system\n128\n5.2.1 Power balance model of grid-connected microgrid\nIn this section, we consider the grid-connected MG which consists of only PV.\nThe power balance can be represented as (5.1), and Equation (5.2) represents the\ntotal PV power based on installed PV panel numbers; see also Section 4.3.1.\nPsolar(t, s) + Pgrid(t, s) =\nKX\ni=1\nxi(t, s) × PMG\npump,i + Pfi (t, s) (5.1)\nPsolar(t, s) = σ × Ppanel\nsolar (t, s) (5.2)\ns.t.\n0 ≤ Pgrid(t, s) ≤ ξ(t, s) × Ptotal\npump (5.3)\n0 ≤ Pfi (t, s) ≤ [1 − ξ(t, s)] × Pmax\nfi (5.4)\nwhere i is the index of pumps;K denotes the number of MG pumps;xi is the\nbinary control variable for the pump’s on/off state in grid-connected MG;s repre-\nsents the index of typical scenarios;Psolar is the PV power generation (kW);Pgrid\nis the power purchased from the utility grid (kW);PMG\npump,i indicates the rated\npower ofith pump connected to MG (kW);Pfi expresses the feed-in power to the\ngrid (kW); Ptotal\npump is the sum of all the pump’s maximum rated power (kW);σ\ndenotes the number of installed PV panel units;Ppanel\nsolar represents the power out-\nput of a single PV panel (kW);ξ is a binary variable indicating the grid energy\n129\nimport or export, withξ(t, s) = 1 meaning that MG purchases energy from the\ngrid (import) at timet in scenarios, andξ(t, s) = 0 meaning the MG sells energy\nto the grid (export) at timet and scenarios, andPmax\nfi indicates the maximum\npower allowed to be fed into the grid (kW). Equations (5.3) and (5.4) represent\nthe constraints that power purchase from the grid and feed-in to the grid cannot\nhappen at the same time.\n5.2.2 Power balance model of islanded microgrid\nAn islanded MG consists of PV, diesel generators, and battery storage. Due to\nthe remote location of cotton farms, the cost of connecting to the grid is too high.\nTherefore, a common solution is using diesel generators as a backup energy source\nto build an islanded MG with renewable energy. The battery storage can help\nsave diesel fuel during the irrigation period by storing excess energy, while the\ndummy load is used to consume the excess energy if the battery is full. Therefore,\nthe power balance can be established as in (5.5).\nKX\ni=1\nxi(t, s) × PMG\npump,i + Pcharge(t, s) + Pdum(t, s) =\nPsolar(t, s) + Pdiesel(t, s) + Pdischarge(t, s) (5.5)\n130\nwhere, Pcharge and Pdischarge represent the charge and discharge power of the\nbattery storage, respectively;Pdum(t, s) is a dummy load at timet and scenarios\nused to consume the excess energy when the battery is fully charged; andPdiesel\nis the power generated by diesel generator (kW).\n5.2.3 Battery model for islanded microgrid\nIn the islanded MG system, storing and utilizing excess renewable energy can\nsave operational costs. In this study, we consider the low-cost lead-acid battery\nfor energy storage systems and compare the degradation cost with its energy cost\nsaving. Battery charging and discharging can be decided by several parameters,\ne.g., battery capacityBcap (kWh), charging and discharging efficiencyηc and ηd.\nEquation (5.6) illustrates the SoC model, and Equations (5.7) - (5.9) list the\nSoC limits and the constraint that charging cannot happen at the same time as\ndischarging. On the other hand, a battery can store energy, but charging and\ndischarging also cause battery degradation. Equations (5.10) - (5.11) show the\nLead-acid battery storage degradation cost,fdeg, based on the Lead-acid battery\ndegradation coefficientκd [171].\nSSOC (t + 1, s) = SSOC (t, s) + Pcharge(t, s) × ηc × ∆t\nBcap\n− Pdischarge(t, s) × ∆t\nBcap × ηd\n(5.6)\n131\ns.t.\nSSOC\nmin ≤ SSOC (t, s) ≤ SSOC\nmax (5.7)\n0 ≤ Pcharge(t, s) ≤ ξB(t, s) × Pmax\ncharge (5.8)\n0 ≤ Pdischarge(t, s) ≤ [1 − ξB(t, s)] × Pmax\ndischarge (5.9)\nκd = CBat\nBcap × ηd × Kc × α\n(5.10)\nfdeg(t, s) = Pcharge(t, s) × ∆t × κd + Pdischarge(t, s) × ∆t × κd (5.11)\nwhere ∆t is the time interval,∆t = 1 h in this study;SSOC indicates the state of\nchargeofbatterystorage(%); SSOC\nmax andSSOC\nmin denotethemaximumandminimum\nSoC, respectively; here we takeSSOC\nmin = 10% and SSOC\nmax = 100%. Pmax\ncharge and\nPmax\ndischarge are the charge and discharge limit of the battery storage, respectively;\nξB is a binary variable of battery charge or discharge, withξB(t, s) = 1 indicating\nthat battery is charged at time t in scenarios and ξB(t, s) = 0 indicating the\nbattery is discharged at time t and scenarios; CBat is the battery storage cost\n(AU$); Kc is the number of the life cycle at the rated depth of discharge (DoD),\nand α (%) is DoD of the battery system.\n132\n5.2.4 Water balance model during the irrigation period\nThe pumps pump water from the bore/river into the reservoir during the cot-\nton irrigation period and the form of energy changes from electrical to potential\nenergy. Farmers irrigate cotton fields with water from the reservoir by gravity.\nTherefore, the water balance is established by the volume of water inflow and\noutflow of the reservoir in (5.12).\nW(t + 1, s) = W(t, s) + Winflow (t, s) − Woutflow (t, s) (5.12)\nWoutflow (t, s) = Wirr(t, s) + Weva(t, s) + Wsee\n24 × 365\n(5.13)\nwhere W (ML) is the total water volume of the reservoir; Winflow (ML) and\nWoutflow (ML) represent the water inflow from and outflow volume to the reser-\nvoir; Wirr and Weva are the hourly cotton farm irrigation water volume (ML) and\nhourly evaporation volume from reservoir (ML), respectively;Wsee (ML) is the\nvalue of average annual seepage from the reservoir, which is 10% of the reservoir\ncapacity [146]. In the grid-connected MG, all the pumps (including MG pumps\nand independent pumps) are electric. In the islanded MG, the MG pumps are\nelectric, while the independent pumps are all diesel pumps. The water inflow\nWinflow for grid-connected MG and islanded MG are expressed as (5.14), respec-\ntively. Also, the daily water usage limitWdaily\nmax (ML) [137] for grid-connected MG\nand islanded MG are expressed by (5.16).\n133\n\n\n\nWinflow (t, s) = PK\ni=1\nxi(t,s)×PMG\npump,i×∆t\nεcon,i×hi\n+ PKin\ni=1\nxin\ni (t,s)×Pin\npump,i×∆t\nεin\ncon,i×hin\ni\n+ WR_res(t, s),\n(grid-connected MG water inflow)\nWinflow (t, s) = PK\ni=1\nxi(t,s)×PMG\npump,i×∆t\nεcon,i×hi\n+ PKin\ni=1\nxin\ni (t,s)×V in\ndiesel,i×∆t\nδin\ndiesel,i×hin\ni\n+ WR_res(t, s),\n(islanded MG water inflow)\n(5.14)\nxi(t, s) (or xin\ni (t, s)) =\n\n\n\n1, when theith pump is on\n0, when theith pump is off\n(5.15)\ns.t.\n\n\n\nPT\nt=1\n \nPK\ni=1\nxi(t,s)×PMG\npump,i×∆t\nεcon,i×hi\n+ PKin\ni=1\nxin\ni (t,s)×Pin\npump,i×∆t\nεin\ncon,i×hin\ni\n!\n≤ Wdaily\nmax ,\n(grid-connected MG water daily limit for all pumps)\nPT\nt=1\n \nPK\ni=1\nxi(t,s)×PMG\npump,i×∆t\nεcon,i×hi\n+ PKin\ni=1\nxin\ni (t,s)×V in\ndiesel,i×∆t\nδin\ndiesel,i×hin\ni\n!\n≤ Wdaily\nmax ,\n(islanded MG water daily limit for all pumps)\n(5.16)\nTX\nt=1\n \nxi(t, s) × PMG\npump,i × ∆t\nεcon,i × hi\n!\n≤ BMG,daily\ni,max (5.17)\n134\n\n\n\nPT\nt=1\n \nxin\ni (t,s)×Pin\npump,i×∆t\nεin\ncon,i×hin\ni\n!\n≤ Bin,daily\ni,max ,\n(grid-connected MG water daily limit for each independent pump)\nPT\nt=1\n \nxin\ni (t,s)×V in\ndiesel,i×∆t\nδin\ndiesel,i×hin\ni\n!\n≤ Bin,daily\ni,max ,\n(islanded MG water daily limit for each independent pump)\n(5.18)\nwhere xin\ni is the binary control variable for the independent pump’s on/off state in\nislanded MG;Kin expresses the number of independent pumps;Pin\npump,i indicates\nthe rated power ofith independent pump in GMG (kW);WR_res is the hourly\nprecipitation amount into the reservoir (ML);T is the prediction horizon (e.g.,\n24 hours); εcon,i = εin\ncon,i = 4.55 kWh/ML/mTDH is the electricity consumed\nfor lifting 1 ML water to 1-metre TDH [136], [172];δin\ndiesel,i denotes the diesel\nconsumption of the ith independent pump in IMG for lifting 1 ML water to 1\nmTHD (L/ML/mTHD);hi and hin\ni (mTDH) are the THD of theith MG pump\nand independent pump, respectively.

The operational cost of\ngrid-connected MG and islanded MG are defined in (5.19) and (5.20), respectively.\nY (t, s) =\n\"\nPgrid(t, s) +\nKX\ni=1\nxin\ni (t, s) × Pin\npump,i\n#\n×∆t × βbuy(t) − Pfi (t, s) × ∆t × βsell(t),\nfor grid-connected MG\n(5.19)\nY (t, s) =\n\"\nPdiesel(t, s) × ψ +\nKin\nX\ni=1\nxin\ni (t, s) × V in\ndiesel,i\n#\n×∆t × βdiesel(t) + fdeg(t, s),\nfor islanded MG\n(5.20)\nwhere Y (t, s) is the operational cost of the MG;βbuy(t) and βsell(t) (AU$/kWh)\nrepresent the tariff of purchasing energy from the grid and the feed-in tariff of\nselling energy to the grid at the tth time, respectively; βdiesel(t) indicates the\ndiesel price at thetth time, andψ is the electricity to diesel conversion coefficient.\n5.2.6 MPC methodology\nIn order to obtain the result of minimizing the operational cost, the first step is\nto optimize the operational cost in a prediction horizon (T) (e.g., 24 hours) with\n136\nthe open-loop optimization model (5.21) by considering all the typical scenarios.\nmin\nxi,xind\ni\nZX\ns=1\nTX\nt=1\nλs × Y (t, s)\nt = 1, . . . , T\ns = 1, . . . , Z\n(5.21)\nwhere, λs represents the probability of the scenario sets after scenario reduction;\nand Z is the number of the typical scenarios. In addition, the closed-loop MPC\nmodel (5.22) is based on (5.21) and moving the prediction horizon to the next\ninterval with periodically updated system information to provide feedback to the\ncontroller. Figure 5.3 illustrates the closed-loop MPC concept. In this study,\nthe disturbances encompass RES uncertainty and reservoir volume uncertainty\narising from weather changes. The control variables include each pump’s on/off\nstates, the battery charge/discharge power, and the power generated by the diesel\ngenerator. The \"State/output feedback\" is used as an input to the next iteration\nto update the system dynamics. The \"Control result feedback\" reflects the value\nof the control variable after each moving horizon, which is optimized in the latest\niteration. The \"Predictor\" block combines the \"State/output feedback\" with\nthe \"Control result feedback\" to predict the \"Future output\". Subsequently, the\n\"Future output\" is inputted to the Optimizer block for the next iteration.\n137\nmin\nxi,xind\ni\nZX\ns=1\nT+mX\nt=1+m\nλs × Y (t, s) (5.22)\nwhere the period[1 +m, ··· , T+ m] is the window of moving prediction horizon.\nFigure 5.3: Closed-loop MPC model\n5.2.7 Scenario-based model\nThis study proposes scenario-based techniques to deal with uncertainty datasets\nfor the MG system. Firstly, we need to determine the uncertainties affecting the\noperational costs of pumping water on the cotton farm, e.g., RES in the power\nbalance model, precipitation, evaporation, and irrigation demand in the water\nbalance model. We propose two scenario-based uncertainty models to process the\n138\nFigure 5.4: Static scenario-based MPC model\n139\nabove-mentioned uncertainties, which are the static scenario-based uncertainty\nmodel and the dynamic scenario-based uncertainty model. In the static uncer-\ntainty model, the whole uncertainty datasets during the entire irrigation period\nare used only once for scenario generation and reduction, and the resultant typi-\ncal scenarios are fixed for all the MPC iterations. The computation time of this\nuncertainty model is less as the scenario generation and reduction only needs\nto be conducted once in the whole MPC time horizon, while the uncertainty\nrepresentation accuracy is sacrificed. Figure 5.4 shows the static scenario-based\nMPC optimization flowchart. In Figure 5.4, all the uncertain datasets are formed\nby matrices and inputted to SCENRED toolbox, where scenario generation and\nreduction process are completed. Then the typical scenarios with their corre-\nsponding probability are sent to the MPC stage to obtain the optimal operational\ncost results.\nIn the dynamic scenario-based uncertainty model, within each moving time hori-\nzon, the future period in close proximityTscen (e.g., ten days or fortnight into\nthe future) can be chosen with the available historical data. Therefore, the corre-\nspondingtypicalscenariosafterscenariogenerationandreductionaredynamically\nupdated within each MPC iteration. The dynamic scenario-based model is more\naccurate as it uses the data in close proximity to generate the typical scenarios;\n140\nFigure 5.5: Dynamic scenario-based MPC model\n141\nhowever, the computation time may be an issue due to the necessity of scenario\ngeneration and reduction within each moving time horizon. Figure 5.5 illustrates\nthe dynamic scenario-based MPC optimization process. The scenario generation\nand reduction are updated within each MPC iteration, and the typical scenarios\nare continuously updated.\nIn summary, the difference between the static and the dynamic scenario-based\nuncertainty models is that the static one obtains the scenarios once for all; while\nthe dynamic case needs to update the typical scenarios for the entire process\ncontinuously.\n5.3 Case study\n5.3.1 Case study overview\nIn order to simulate the proposed scenario-based stochastic MPC approach for\nthe cotton farm MG, we use the cotton farm information based on Section 4.3\nfrom a real cotton farm located in Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia. The\ncorresponding historical data are used for the irrigation period of 87 days (early\nNovember 2016 to the end of February 2017) in this study. Five different cases\nare adopted to compare the results and demonstrate the applicability of the ap-\nproach, which include Baseline case and standard MPC, static scenario-based\nMPC for grid-connected MG, dynamic scenario-based MPC for grid-connected\n142\nMG, static scenario-based MPC for islanded MG, and dynamic scenario-based\nMPC for islanded MG.\nTable 5.1: System parameters of the grid-connected MG in the cotton farm\nItems Values\nMG bore Pump #1 (PMG\npump,1) 75 kW\nMG river Pump #2 (PMG\npump,2) 37 kW\nIndependent bore Pump #1 (Pin\npump,1) 75 kW\nFarm area 3 ×106 m2\nBore pump head (h1 or hin\n1 ) 31 mTDH\nRiver pump head (h2) 12 mTDH\nAverage energy for lifting 1 ML/mTDH (εcon) 4.55 kWh/ML/mTDH\nAverage water demand (Wirr) 6.5 ×10−4 ML/m2\nMaximum allowed water usage 1800 ML/year\nReservoir capacity 800 ML\nAverage hourly seepage (Wsee/(24 × 365)) 4.56 m 3/h\nInstalled solar PV capacity (σ × Ppanel\nsolar ) 50.6 kW\nFixed-rate tariff in 2016 (βbuy) 0.26 AU$/kWh\nFIT in 2016 (βsell) 0.06 AU$/kWh\n5.3.2 Case 1: Baseline case and standard MPC.\nThe Baseline case is that farmers manually control all pumping systems based on\ntheir irrigation experience, and they can also obtain future weather information\nfrom the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) or local weather stations. Figure 5.1\ndemonstrates the equipment layout and irrigation mode of the grid-connected MG\nin the study cotton farm. Table 5.1 lists the corresponding system parameters\n143\nin Figure 5.1 [138]. Based on Section 4.3, the breakdown energy cost of the\nBaseline case is listed in Table 5.2. While for the standard MPC of this study,\nthe operational cost of the studied cotton farm is discussed in Section 4.3. For\na comparison of the current study, the Baseline and standard MPC results from\nSection 4.3 are shown in Table 5.3.\nTable 5.2: The details of the pump operation in the Baseline case in 2016\nValues\nMG bore Pump #1 work hours 1,034 h\nMG river Pump #2 work hours 882 h\nIndependent bore Pump #1 work hours 360 h\nMG bore Pump #1 usage 75,812.33 kWh\nMG river Pump #2 usage 63,551.06 kWh\nIndependent bore Pump #1 usage 12,865.24 kWh\nTotal operational cost AU$ 39,580\nTotal pumped water 1,223.6 ML\nTable 5.3: Operational results of Baseline case and standard MPC\nMG items\nOperational cost\n(AU$)\nTotal pumped water\n(ML)\ngrid-connected MG Baseline 39,580 1,224\ngrid-connected MG MPC 27,556 1,181\nislanded MG Baseline 40,902 1,181\nislanded MG MPC 31,164 1,178\n144\n5.3.3 Case 2: Static scenario-based MPC for grid-connected MG\nIn this case, we take advantage of the static scenario generation and reduction\nfrom Section 5.2.7 to obtain ten sets of typical scenarios and the corresponding\nprobability of each scenario using the 87-day historical data. For the operational\ncost optimization, ten typical scenarios are substituted into (5.21). At last, the\nclosed-loop MPC of (5.22) with a prediction horizon of 24 hours is used to obtain\neach pump’s operation status and the operational cost of the entire irrigation\nperiod.\n5.3.4 Case 3: Dynamic scenario-based MPC for grid-connected MG\nThe simulation is based on the dynamic scenario-based uncertainty model in Sec-\ntion 5.2.7, which uses the historical data of 14 days ahead of the current time\ninstant. For this study, we compare both the static and dynamic scenario-based\nMPC approaches. Thus, the same historical data are used for this approach. The\ndifferences between the static and dynamic scenario-based approaches are that\nin the dynamic one, we obtain 10 typical scenarios based on the moving 14-day\ndatasets, and the obtained 10 typical scenarios will be updated at each MPC\niteration whenever the optimization horizon changes.\n145\n5.3.5 Case 4: Static scenario-based MPC for islanded MG\nMany cotton farm pumping sites in Australia are far from the grid [173]. islanded\nMGs using diesel generators, solar energy, and lead-acid battery storage are widely\nbuilt on cotton farms. Based on the previous MPC study for islanded MG in\nSection 4.3.2, the islanded MG of the studied cotton farm is shown in Figure 5.2,\nwith the system parameters in Table 5.4. Then, we substitute the historical data\nof the studied cotton farm in 2016 and adopt the algorithm proposed in Section\n5.2.7. The pump operation during the entire irrigation period can be optimized\nfor the islanded MG system. Also, the operation cost under uncertainties can be\nobtained.\n5.3.6 Case 5: Dynamic scenario-based MPC for islanded MG\nDynamic scenario generation and reduction are applied for islanded MG using\nthe model in Section 5.2.7, and then the operational cost and each pump’s action\ncan be obtained by the underlying stochastic MPC methodology. In order to\ncompareboththestaticanddynamicscenario-basedMPC,thesamecottonfarm’s\nhistorical data are used.\n146\nTable 5.4: System parameters of the islanded MG in the studied cotton farm [174]\nItems Values\nDiesel conversion\ncoefficient (ψ) 0.2695 L/kWh\nDiesel consumption\nfor lifting 1ML/m water (δdiesel) 1.1 L/ML/mTDH\nUnit price of diesel in 2016\n(after subsidy) (βdiesel) AU$ 1.15 /L\nLead-acid battery\ncapacity (CBat) 25 kWh\nLead-acid battery\ncost (Bcap) AU$ 2,750\nCharge/discharge\nefficiencies (ηc or ηd) 90%\nCharge/discharge limit\n(Pmax\ncharge/Pmax\ndischarge) 15 kWh\nLead-acid battery life cycle\n(Kc × α) 2000 @ 60% DoD\n147\n5.4 Results and discussions\nThis section discusses the key results of MPC for cotton farm MG under uncer-\ntainties. Scenariogenerationandreductionmethodologyareemployedtosimulate\nfour different cases (cases 2 - 5), and the results from each case are analyzed and\ncompared to the Baseline case.\nI. Static scenario generation and reduction\nIn this study, the cotton farm data during the irrigation period of 2016-2017\ninclude historical solar generation data, rainfall data [142], hourly evapora-\ntion data of the cotton farm area [175] and the cotton life-cycle water demand\ndata. For the entire irrigation period, scenario generation and reduction can\nbe illustrated in Figure 5.6a and Figure 5.6b, respectively. From Figure 5.6a,\nit can be seen that all historical data of uncertainty are arranged in groups\nof 24 hours each, spanning a total of 87 days. The four different types of\nuncertain historical data include hourly PV power generation, hourly rain-\nfall, hourly evaporation volume, and hourly water demand. On the other\nhand, Figure 5.6b indicates that the historical data of the aforementioned\nfour types of uncertainties have undergone static scenario generation and\nreduction, resulting in 10 sets of typical scenarios, as seen in Figure 5.6b.\n148\n(a) Uncertainty data for the entire irrigation period\n(b) Ten typical scenarios after reduction\nFigure 5.6: Static scenario generation and reduction for the studied cotton farm\n149\nFigure 5.7: Probability of static typical scenarios\nNote that the scenario generation and reduction is only conducted once dur-\ning the entire irrigation period. Each typical scenario has its corresponding\nprobability, as shown in Figure 5.7.\nII. Dynamic scenario generation and reduction\nIn the dynamic scenario generation and reduction method, we take the two-\nweek data ahead of the current time instant to produce 10 typical scenarios.\nFor instance, Figure 5.8a and Figure 5.8b show the evaporation curves be-\nfore and after scenario generation and reduction methodology in 4 consec-\nutive MPC iterations. Note that the scenario generation and reduction on\na small variation of data is conducted in each MPC iteration to obtain the\ndynamically updated typical scenarios, as seen in Figure 5.8.\n150\n(a) 14-day evaporation data\n(b) Ten evaporation typical scenarios after reduction in 4 consecutive MPC iterations\nFigure 5.8: Dynamic scenario generation and reduction by using the future 14-day data\n151\nIII. Scenario-based MPC operation results for grid-connection micro-\ngrid\nWith the help of the scenario generation and reduction method for the histor-\nical dataset, we implement the close-loop MPC to optimize the operation of\neach pump during the whole irrigation period. The hourly control variables\n(xi and xin\ni ) can be obtained by solving (5.19) and (5.22). Figure 5.9a shows\nthe on/off status of MG bore pump #1 (turned on for 1,125 h), MG river\npump #2 (turned on for 810 h) and the independent pump #1 (turned on\nfor 176 h), which are controlled under the static scenario-based MPC. Figure\n5.9b shows the pump’s on/off status under the dynamic scenario-based MPC,\nwhere MG bore pump #1 worked for 1,031 h, MG river pump #2 worked\nfor 1,137 h, and the independent pump #1 worked for 76 h. It can be ob-\nserved from Figure 5.9 that the usage rate of the water pumps connected to\nthe MG is higher than the independent pump. The utilization rate of the\nindependent pump in the static scenario-based MPC is slightly higher than\nthat in the dynamic scenario-based MPC. Table 5.5 shows the comparison of\nthe proposed scenario-based MPC with the Baseline case and the standard\nMPC. The expected value of the operational cost for static scenario-based\nMPC is AU$ 22,595, which saves AU$ 16,985 compared with the Baseline\n152\n(a) Pump’s on/off status under static scenario-based MPC\n(b) Pump’s on/off status under dynamic scenario-based MPC\nFigure 5.9: Pump’s on/off status for grid-connected microgrid\n153\ncase and saves AU$ 4,961 compared with the standard MPC. Moreover, the\nexpected operational cost value of the dynamic scenario-based MPC is AU$\n18,797, which is AU$ 20,783 less than the Baseline case and AU$ 8,759 less\nthan the standard MPC.\nTable 5.5: Operational result comparison of grid-connected microgrid\nOperational cost Total pumped\n(AU$) water (ML)\nBaseline case 39,580 1,224\nStandard MPC 27,556 1,181\nStatic scenario-based MPC 22,595 1,233\nDynamic scenario-based MPC 18,797 1,238\nIV.

The scenario generation and\nreduction processes use the same dataset to facilitate the comparison with\nthe Baseline case and the standard MPC for islanded MG. Based on (5.20)\nand (5.22), the pump control variables can be obtained and listed in Table\n5.6. In addition, Table 5.7 shows the results of total pumped water volume\nand the operational cost for each islanded MG case. The expected value of\noperational cost from the static scenario-based MPC is AU$ 13,486 lower\nthan the Baseline case and AU$ 3,748 lower than the standard MPC. For\nthe dynamic scenario-based MPC, it has the lowest operational cost value\nAU$ 24,443, which is AU$ 16,459 lower than the Baseline case and AU$ 6,721\nlower than the standard MPC. In the islanded MG system, the excess electri-\ncal energy is stored in the batteries and released to the pumps when needed.\nAccording to the battery pack parameters in Table 5.4, and the methodology\nin Section 5.2.3, the battery pack usage during the entire irrigation period\ncan be obtained. Figure 5.10 shows the battery charging and discharging\npattern for the static and dynamic scenario-based MPC. Meanwhile, Table\n5.8 lists the operational results of the battery storage. We can observe from\nFigure 5.8 that the dynamic scenario-based MPC generates ten typical sce-\nnarios for each MPC iteration, and thus, the role of batteries can be clearly\n156\nreflected in the MG. The battery pack for the dynamic scenario-based MPC\ncan reuse 821 kWh of excess energy to power the MG pumps. During the\nentire irrigation period, the energy cost savings from utilizing the battery\nstorage is AU$ 87.24 more than the cost of battery pack degradation under\nthe dynamic scenario-based MPC, which means using the battery to store\nand reuse the excess energy from the RES can save the operational cost of\nAU$ 87.24.\n5.5 Summary\nThis study proposes two scenario-based approaches to model the uncertainties of\nenvironmental and demand factors on cotton farms by scenario generation and\nreduction under the MPC framework. Then, the MPC method is used to optimize\nthe operation of the MG and cotton farm water pump under the obtained typical\nscenarios for the underlying uncertainties. The proposed method is validated by\ncase studies on a cotton farm. It is found that the operational cost of the static\nand dynamic scenario-based MPC for the grid-connected MG are AU$ 22,595 and\nAU$ 18,797, which are AU$ 4,961 and AU$ 8,759 respectively, lower than that\nof the standard MPC. For the islanded MG, the operational cost of static and\ndynamic scenario-based MPC are AU$ 3,748 and AU$ 6,721, respectively, lower\nthan the standard MPC.\n157\nChapter 6\nConclusions and Future Work\nThis chapter summarizes the current studied results and provides suggestions for\nfurther work.\n6.1 Summary of outcomes\nIn the literature review part of the thesis, the energy system of cotton farms\nand the irrigation method of cotton are investigated, and the traditional energy\nutilization methods of cotton farms are studied. The composition of current\noperational costs and their limitations are addressed. In addition, this part also\nreviews the MG’s techno-economic requirements and the optimization algorithms.\nAnd then, the following optimization strategies are introduced for the MG of\nAustralian cotton farms: optimal investment planning, optimal operation, and\n158\noptimal operation under uncertainties.\nChapter 3 proposes a novel MG optimal design method for Australian cotton\nfarms. The design problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization prob-\nlem. It seeks the trade-off among those objective functions, which are related\nto the investment cost, operational cost and simple payback period. In the case\nstudy of a real cotton farm, a number of different MG scenarios are presented to\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. In addition, sensitivity analysis\nis explored by changing different parameters to explain the impact of the cost\nfunction’s weighting factors, weather conditions and tariff selection on the MG\ndesign. In the studied cotton farm, the simulation results show that the operat-\ning cost can be reduced by 44.16% to 56.51% with the optimal MGs in different\nscenarios compared with the farm’s existing energy consumption, and the simple\npayback period is 8.35 - 9.49 years. The grid-connected MG can feed the excess\nenergy into the grid to accelerate the payback period, which depends on particular\nFIT tariffs. This case study provides a reference for cotton industry stakeholders\nto consider RES investment in cotton farms.\nChapter 4 introduces an MPC approach to the operating cost minimization prob-\nlem for an Australian cotton farm MG. It also shows the robustness of the MPC\nalgorithm under rainy and drought conditions for the grid-connected MG. The\n159\ncase study results of the cotton farm in the Gunnedah show that the MPC ap-\nproach reduces the operational cost of the grid-connected MG from AU$ 39,580\nto AU$ 27,556, and using the MPC method for the islanded MG can reduce the\noperational cost from AU$ 40,902 to AU$ 31,164. Furthermore, in the case study\nof another cotton farm in Narromine, the large-scale MG with ESS can reduce the\noperational cost from AU$ 317,415 to AU$ 234,260, and if this MG has no ESS,\nthe operational cost is reduced from AU$ 317,415 to AU$ 242,970. The MPC\napproach can be combined with future weather forecast data to achieve the MG’s\nreal-time operation in the cotton farm.\nChapter 5 presents two scenario-based approaches to model uncertainty in cot-\nton farm environmental and demand factors through scenario generation and re-\nduction under the MPC framework. Then, with the obtained typical scenarios,\nthe MPC method is used to optimize the operation of the MG and cotton farm\npumps. The proposed method is simulated through a case study of a cotton farm\nin Gunnedah. For the grid-connected MG, the static and dynamic scenario-based\nMPC approaches have operational costs of AU$ 22,595 and AU$ 18,797, respec-\ntively, which are lower than the standard MPC by AU$ 4,961 and AU$ 8,759,\nrespectively. For the islanded MG, the operational costs of the static and dy-\nnamic scenario-based MPC approaches are AU$ 27,416 and AU$ 24,443, which\n160\nare AU$ 3,748 and AU$ 6,721 lower than that of the standard MPC.\n6.2 Recommendations & future work\nThis thesis proposes methodologies for planning investment optimization, opera-\ntionoptimizationandoperationoptimizationunderuncertaintyfortheRES-based\nMG in Australian cotton farms. These methods consider taking advantage of RES\n(especially solar) and battery energy storage to reduce the operational costs of\ncotton farm pumps. Meanwhile, more recommendations are proposed below that\nwould extend the current research.\n1. For chapter 3, only grid-connected cotton farms are considered. However,\nthere is a number of cotton farms that are not grid-connected. Therefore,\nour future work will focus on the feasibility of MG designs for cotton farms\nwhere grid power is limited or unavailable.\n2. For an immediate future study, artificial intelligence is a beneficial tool for\nagricultural technology development, and MPC can be combined with ma-\nchine learning techniques to realize intelligent control. In addition, there is a\nneed to evaluate and implement the proposed method at a real cotton farm\nin our future work.\n161\n3. In future work, the static scenario-based MPC approach for cotton farm MG\ncontrolsystems will use more years of historical data to improve its reliability.\nFor the dynamic scenario-based MPC approach, we will investigate how to\nreduce the computation burden for real-time implementations.\n162\nBibliography\n[1] G.

variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n10 \n \n \nExecutive summary \nThe objectives of this project were to (i) identify the causal factors for yield variability and \n(ii) develop strategic soil and crop management options to address yield variability and \nimprove soil health and sustainability in cotton farming systems. The project conducted a \npaired field comparison during the 2018-19 season to identify the causes of yield variability \nbetween cotton fields in close proximity and of the same soil type. As drought impacted the \nnumber of cotton fields under cotton in that year, the investigation focused on soil property-\ninduced yield differences at paired fields within five farms. The paired fields at each farm \nrecorded an average yield difference of >284 kg/ha (1.25 bales/ha). Despite being the same \nsoil type, several soil properties differed between the paired fields at each farm comparison. \nThe soil organic carbon stocks were higher in the higher-yielding fields (five-year average \nyield) at all the farm comparisons and the normalised lint yield percentage was positively \ncorrelated with soil organic carbon stocks. Soil sodicity was higher in the lower-yielding \nfields at 3 of the 5 farms. Soil compaction was a potential causal factor for lower yield at one \npaired-field comparison in the Macquarie region. Results for most soil nutrient tests were \nabove the critical concentrations recommended for Australian cotton production. Visual soil \nassessment (VSA) using the FAO method was carried out across paired sites, multiple CSD \nambassador sites and within ACRI across multiple cropping systems. No earthworms were \ndetected at any site during visual soil assessment or soil sampling across all the sites. The \nvisual soil quality index using FAO method was not a sensitive predictor of cotton crop \nperformance. However, future investigation into individual components such as scoring for \nsoil structure, surface crusting etc. will improve the understanding of soil conditions and \nsubsequent management decisions. \nComparing soil properties using a paired-field approach identified compaction, sodicity and \nsoil organic carbon levels among casual factors of yield differences. To assess the relative \ncontributions of selected soil constraints and strategic management to address the yield \ndifferences, further investigations were carried out at Australian Cotton Research Institute, \nincluding, \n1. Assessing the effect of soil compaction on cotton lint yield and its legacy effect on \nsubsequent cotton and wheat crop \n2. Assessing the effect of winter cereal cover crop, chickpea and wheat stubble management \non soil strength and cotton and wheat yield performance \n3. Assessing the cotton lint yield response to applied P and its legacy effect in subsequent \ncrops \n4. Assessing the legacy effect of maize rotation on cotton lint yield, disease incidence and \nsoil organic carbon under maximum and minimum tillage  \n5. Assessing the cotton crop response to foliar sprays after a flooding event \n6. Assessing the effect of simulated hail damage on lint yield penalty for cotton crop \n7. Assessing the long-term changes in soil micro-nutrients and their implications for the \ncotton cropping system \n8. Assessing the ability of cotton strip assay to detect soil management-induced differences \nin microbial activity \n \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n11 \n \n \n1. To assess the effect of compaction induced by in-field traffic, a novel investigation was \ncarried out by continuously monitoring crop canopy temperature and soil profile moisture and \nmeasuring crop yield by comparing compacted and non-compacted areas within fields. \nTraffic by a tractor weighing 19.2 tonnes on either side of the plant row reduced lint yield by \n27% due to lower crop height and reduced leaf area, biomass, and fruit number. Water \nrecharge in the soil profile from irrigation and rainfall was reduced by 16% due to \ncompaction with the highest reduction being 86% at 0.3–0.5m depth. Further assessments \nwere carried out to assess the legacy effect of soil compaction. The results suggest there was \nno further legacy effect of soil compaction on cotton lint yield and wheat yield in subsequent \nseasons beyond the season when compaction occurred. The self-repair potential of Vertosols \nwith a clay content of 62% likely assisted the natural and wheat rotation-mediated alleviation \nof soil compaction. Future investigation needs to repeat this research on a greater range of \nsoils typically used for irrigated cotton production, focusing on the time required to repair the \nsoil compaction induced by heavy round-bale pickers using natural and rotation crop tactics. \n \n2. Long-term continuous cropping research showed the benefits of leaving wheat as standing \nstubble after harvest compared to stubble incorporation by tillage. The benefits included less \ntillage and fuel use and better wheat yields during dry winter years. Introducing a chickpea \nrotation increased the disease risk in subsequent cotton compared to wheat rotation. \nAssessing other benefits of chickpeas requires long-term investigation. A winter oat cover \ncrop may not be a suitable break crop for a system planted with cotton every summer. The \ngross margin/ML of water was always higher for the cotton-wheat system; however, the gross \nmargin/ha was higher for cotton monoculture over the long term. Future research needs to \nfocus on additional rotation crops that can alleviate soil compaction and improve the soil \norganic carbon and productivity of the cropping systems \n \n3. The response to phosphorus application was investigated by subdividing the selected \ncropping systems (cotton-wheat and cotton-oats cover crop systems) within the long-term \nexperiments. P fertiliser application before an oats cover crop increased cotton lint yield \ncompared to P applied when planting the cotton. The results suggest there was a lint yield \nresponse to applied P in the season of application but there was no legacy effect of applied P \nbeyond the season of application. To better understand the response of cotton plants to \napplied P fertiliser, future research needs to quantify the movement of applied P into the \nslowly available BSES P pool in the soil. \n \n4. There was no legacy of the effect of maize rotation on cotton lint yield in the four years \nsince its last planting in 2017–18. Maize is a good break crop for managing Verticillium \ndisease and there was a maize legacy effect on microbial catabolic diversity. Soil organic \ncarbon concentration started declining after the last planting of maize in 2017-18.  \n \n5. Flooding decreased the alkaline soil pH towards neutral. The application of foliar nutrient \nspray products after a significant flooding event on a Vertosol did not improve cotton lint \nyield, biomass or fibre quality, however previous studies indicated foliar nutrient sprays \napplied prior to flooding may improve crop performance. Improved soil structural properties \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n12 \n \n \nthrough minimum tillage practices (higher bed height) is more likely to assist cotton recovery \nfrom floods than applying foliar nutrients. The water use efficiency of the minimum tilled \ncotton wheat system is higher than cotton monoculture system.  \n \n6. The hail simulation investigation indicated there was no influence of hail damage \nsimulation on cotton lint yield across three experiments. The results suggested that, if the \ngrowers don’t have appropriate crop insurance, continuing with a December-hailed crop \ncould result in average lint yield provided other factors are not limiting the cotton crop \ngrowth and maturity. \n \n7. There was no evidence of decline or changes in stratification of total micronutrients in \nintensively managed Vertosols. Apart from Zinc, other micronutrients (manganese, iron, \ncopper) were not observed to be nearing critical deficiency concentrations, and therefore \nmicronutrient stratification and decline in irrigated cotton-growing Vertisols are unlikely to \nbe yield limiting, provided that surface soil properties are well managed. The findings of this \nstudy will be useful for benchmarking the micronutrient status after an extended period of \ncropping in the future and also for the soil management decisions (such as pH and SOC). \n \n8. The investigation on cotton strip assay (CSA) using loss of tensile strength measurements \nsuggested that CSA can be an effective indicator of microbial activity, soil organic carbon or \ncrop biomass as influenced by agricultural practices in cotton fields. The CSA weight-loss \nmethod was found to be a simpler and cheaper means of assessing the loss of tensile strength \nof a standard cotton strip after burial in the soil, compared to breaking the strip with a \ntensometer. Assessing the soil biology status in Australian cotton-growing soils does not \nrequire specialised laboratory equipment, just attention to detail when preparing and a \nreliable balance for weighing, thus increasing the potential for wider adoption of the CSA. \n \nIdentifying and addressing causal factors of yield variability requires a multi-year effort \nacross a variety of seasonal conditions (normal, wetter and drier than normal). Multi-year and \nmulti-location grower-driven strip trials with the involvement of researchers to document the \nkey data will build the dataset required to interpret and improve the understanding of yield \nvariability. Building a dataset is the first key step in addressing variability. However, the \ndevelopment of a centrally-managed database (e.g. CRDC or CSD or a common cotton \nindustry body similar to GRDC’s Better Fertiliser Decision for Cropping (BFDC) or grains \non-farm trial database (https://www.farmtrials.com.au/) or Soil CRC’s Visualising  \nAustralasia’s soils database (https://data.soilcrc.com.au/map/about)) could enable the data \ncapture from all the on-farm trials and support the efforts to understand and address the \ncotton yield variability. The data needs to be screened to make sure it has proper quality \nassurance protocols and has enough supporting meta-data for it to be useful for future \ninterpretation. Such effort should be accompanied by ongoing maintenance of the database. \n  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n13 \n \n \nChapter 1: Soil property differences and irrigated-cotton lint yield—cause \nand effect?

Differences in soil properties may \ncause these yield variations. Identifying which facto rs are causal and what management can be \nimplemented to mitigate the impacts should optimise inputs and improve profits. During the 2018 –19 \nsummer cotton -growing season, a paired -field comparison approach was used to investigate and \nimprove the understanding of soil property-induced yield differences within 5 farms. The paired fields \nat each farm recorded an average yield difference of >284 kg/ha (1.25 bales/ha). Several soil properties \ndiffered between the paired fields at each farm comparison. The soil organic carbon stocks were higher \nin the higher-yielding fields (five-year average yield) at all the farm comparisons and the normalised \nlint yield percentage was positively correlated with soil organic carbon stocks. Soil sodicity was higher \nin the lower-yielding fields at 3 of the 5 farms. Soil compaction was a potential causal factor for lower \nyield at one of the Macquarie comparisons. Results for most soil nutrient tests were above the \nrecommended critical concentrations for Australian cotton production. No earthworms were detected \nduring visual soil assessment or soil sampling across all the sites. Visual soil assessment may not be a \nsensitive predictor of cotton crop performance. Comparing soil properties using a paired field approach \nmay assist cotton g rowers in understanding the factors behind yield differences. A similar approach \ncould be adopted for within-field variability by dividing the fields into performance zones and assessing \nthe soil properties of each zone separately. \nKey words: Paired field, cotton, soil, lint yield \n1 Introduction \nCotton is an important fibre crop grown across numerous countries with a wide variation in yield \nboth between and within countries. In Australia, the average cotton lint yield (2500 kg/ha) is higher \nthan the world's average lint yield (800 kg/ha) (CRDC and Cotton Australia, 2020). However, there is \na significant yield variability across the various regions in the industry. Cotton yields can vary \nsubstantially within the same field despite having the same management and weather conditions. This \nis understood to be due to cotton yi elds being impacted by a range of diverse factors including water, \nsoil health, climate, nutrition, pests, diseases, and weeds (Constable and Bange, 2015). In-field variation \nof these factors, both individually and via complex intera ctions, are known to affect cotton lint yield \npotential. While long-term experiments can improve the understanding of the causal factors for yield \ndifferences, significant resources and time are often constraints to establishing and maintaining such \nexperiments in sufficient numbers across distinct  climatic regions. Simulations of varying climate \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n14 \n \n \nscenarios, crop management practices and soil characteristics is one approach to investigating the \nrelative impact of these factors, but actual field data is essen tial to validate models and improve their \npredictive capabilities. \nIn Australia, cotton has been traditionally grown on highly fertile Vertosols (Isbell and National \nCommittee on Soil and Terrain, 2021 ). The cotton-growing regions in Australia are currently located \nacross four states (New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia). Recent \nstudies indicate a decline  in soil fertility under cotton cropping systems (Nachimuthu et al., 2022c; \nPalmer et al., 2023) which could result in additional limitations for realising the yield potential. Many \nof the newer areas being brought into intensive cotton production often include soils that are not as \nfertile and feature one or more inherent constraints to plant growth.  \nInvestigating soil properties could be the first step to assist growers to improve their understanding \nof soil property induced yield differences. Previous research in USA compared the soil property \ndifferences (0-20 cm) between high and average yielding soybean areas (Adams et al., 2017; Adams et \nal., 2018) and identified properties such as soil organic carbon and extractable phosphorus levels were \nhigher in selected high yielding soybean fields. There have been no such comparative studies on cotton \nfields in Australia. \nUnderstanding the soil physical, chemical and biological properties and their contributions to yield \nvariability is important. Soil test based nutrient recommendations are part of commercial agronomic \nservices that is prevalent in cropping industries including cotton in Australia and elsewhere across the \nworld. This test predominantly covers the chemical properties. Soil physical properties are not measured \nregularly inspite of the use of heavy machinery that induces soil compaction (Jamali et al., 2021). Soil \nbiological properties are often perceived as time consuming and difficult to measure, although recent \ncommercial test are emerging to fill the gap (Predicta B, 2023). A visual soil assessment was proposed \nby United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (Shepherd et al. , 2008 ) as an universal \nassessment for soil health indicator. This assessment incorporates a range of soil physical, hydrological \nand biological indicators to provide an aggregate score and could potentially be used for assess ment \nand comparison of fields with yield differences. However, the ability of visual soil assessment to \ndelineate the field with yield differences are yet to be investigated.  \nTo investigate the soil property induced yield differences a case study was unde rtaken comparing \nfive paired fields (10 fields) spread across three cotton growing regions. Five paired fields (10 fields) \nacross three cotton growing regions were investigated to determine if soil properties identified through \nroutine laboratory testing could be linked to yield differences. To establish if addition of the Visual Soil \nAssessment added any further insight to the yield differences, a sub sample three of the paired sites (six \nfields) were assessed. In this on-farm study across the Australian cotton industry, we hypothesised the \nyield differences were related to soil properties and initially focussed on between field yield differences. \n2 Materials and methods \n2.1 Study location and site selection \nThe farms were located in the Gwydir Valley, Macquarie and Riverina cotton growing regions of New \nSouth Wales, Australia. The sites were selected in discussion with the CottonInfo team (Australian \nCotton Industry’s extension wing), cotton growers and agronomists. The locations of each farm (Figure \n1.1, Table 1 .1) are described in section 2.2. The soils in Gwydir Valley irrigation area are relatively \nuniform and were mostly formed from alluvial sediments (NSWDOI, 2018; Aus Gov, 2023). The soils \nin the Macquarie irrigation area are part of the clay plains of the Warren-Trangie region and may include \npatches of aeolian deposits (parna) (McKenzie, 1992). The soils in the Riverina cotton -growing area \nare highly variable with most being a mixture of parna (Cattle and Smith, 2018 ) and several riverine \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n15 \n \n \ndeposition layers. Natural fluvial pathways through parna depositions and the use of laser levelling to \nimprove irrigation efficiency have produced additional variability in these fields. The soil texture of all \nthe fields under investigation is clay ranging from light (Riverina) to heavy clay (Gwydir). \n \nFigure 1.1. Location of cotton farms selected for investigation in this study \nThe annual average rainfall of the case study regions varied from 395 mm in Riverina to 569 in Gwydir \nregions (Table A1 .1, supplementary data). The average monthly mean maximum and minimum \ntemperatures declined from Gwydir to Riverina region as expected from Northern to Southern latitudes \n(Table A1.2, supplementary data). \n2.2 Field comparisons \nA total of 10 fields were investigated with five within-farm paired comparisons made. Historical yield \nrecords (five-year field average) were collected from growers. The paired fields recorded an average \nyield difference of at least 284 kg lint/ha (or 1.25  bales/ha, 1 bale= 227 kg lint) or higher, mostly \naccording to the growers' average historical yield records. For those fields where the historical yield \ninformation was not available, yield assessment in the 2018 –19 season was used for the study. Soil \nsampling of all fields occurred in November and December 2018. Soil chemical properties were \nanalysed using methods described in Rayment and Lyons (2010) (Table 1.2). In comparisons Gwydir, \nMacquarie 1 and Macquarie 2, visual soil assessment using the FAO method (Shepherd et al., 2008) \nwas also undertaken to compare the soil quality (section 2.4). \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n16 \n \n \nTable 1.1.

The \nbasal fertiliser application in the 2018 -19 season included 290, 32.5 and 50 kg of N, P and K, \nrespectively. The soil type in this valley is predominantly cracking clay with >50% clay. Both the fields \nhad been harvested with round bale module pickers since 2011 and have been under similar \nmanagement. Laser levelling details were not available from the farm manager.  \n2.2.2 Comparisons Macquarie Valley A and B \nTwo pairs of adjacent fields within the Macquarie valley in Central West NSW were selected for two \ncomparative analyses. The soil type in this field is described as fine, thermic, smectitic, typic haplustert \nand soil texture on this farm was classified as 52, 16 and 32 g/100g of clay, silt and sand (Hulugalle et \nal., 2017). The basal fertiliser application for the first pair (Macquarie Valley A) in the 2018-19 season \nincluded 150, 44 and 25 kg/ha of N, P and K respectively. Both fields had been harvested using round \nbale module pickers since 2011 and were under similar management. Macquarie Valley B was between \nthe second pair of adjacent fields located in Macquarie valley in Central West NSW. The basal fertiliser \napplication in the 2018 -19 season included 150, 44 and 25 kg/ha of N, P and K respectively. An \nadditional 160–200 kg N/ha of N was applied in-crop N as a water-run fertiliser application for both the \npairs. Both fields have been harvested using round bale module pick ers since 2011 and were under \nsimilar management.  \n2.2.3 Comparisons Riverina A and B \nTwo pairs of adjacent fields within the Riverina region in Southern NSW were selected for two \ncomparative analyses. No yield records were available for both the pairs. In 2018 –19, lint yields were \nmeasured by hand harvesting at each of the soil sampling locations. Both the pairs had a bankless \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n17 \n \n \nchannel irrigation system. Soil properties in the two fields were highly variable as a result of fluvial and \naeolian deposition and earthworks for constructing the irrigation system. The soil texture of both fields \nwas heavy clay however, there was increasing clay content at the deeper depths. The soil texture of both \nthe fields at 0-15 cm were 40, 9 and 51 g/100 g of clay, silt and sand. The soil texture of both the fields \nat 15-30 cm were 55, 6 and 39 g/100 of clay, silt and sand. The soil texture of 30-90 cm was 62, 8 and \n30 g/100 g of clay, silt and sand.  \nThe second pair in the Riverina region were laser levelled in 2017, one year befor e sampling. Yield \nmeasurements were undertaken at each of the sampling locations. Half of the 300 kg N/ha nitrogen \napplied was as urea, with the rest supplied in a blend with other nutrients (N-46.2%, P-11.4%, S-7.8%).  \n2.3 Yield estimation \nCotton was handpick ed from 1 m 2 per sampling core point for yield estimation (A total of 9 m 2 per \nfield). Seed cotton was weighed. A <500 g seed cotton subsample was ginned using a 20-saw gin with \na pre-cleaner (Continental Eagle, Prattville, AL, USA) to determine the gin turnout (i.e., the percentages \nof seed and lint by mass). The lint turnout (% lint) was used to estimate the lint yield from seed cotton \nand the results were reported as bales lint/ha. For each comparison, the grower (5 year average) lint \nyield or the measured lint yield in 2018 -19 was used to derive a normalised lint yield percen tage. The \nlow yielding field lint yield percentage was worked out in relation to high yielding field for each \ncomparison.  \n2.4 Soil sampling and analysis \nSoil samples were taken from 0 -90 cm depth (0 -15, 15 -30, 30 -45, 45 -60 and 60 -90 cm depth \nincrements). Nine cores per field were taken (3 cores taken 50 m from the head-ditch end, 3 cores taken \n50 m away from the tail drain end and 3 cores from the middle of the field) in all the fields. Soil samples \nwere air dried to constant weight at 40 oC and samples were weighed. A sub sample of each soil sample \nwere oven dried at 105 oC to estimate the soil moisture. The bulk density of the soil samples at each \ndepth increment was calculated by dividing the oven-dry mass (105 oC) of the soil at each depth by the \nvolume of the soil core. Soil samples were ground to < 2 mm then homogenised and sub-sampled using \na riffle splitter for each depth increment in every core. The processed samples were analysed for \nchemical parameters described in Rayment and Lyons (2010) . The soil available P is presented as \nColwell P (Colwell, 1963). Soil organic carbon and mineral N stocks were calculated by multiplying \nthe soil organic carbon and mineral N concentrations adjusted for soil moisture (105 0C oven drying) \nwith the bulk density at respective depths.

The \ntop 20 cm of soil were scored for soil texture, structure, colour, mottles, earthworms, rooting depth, \nsurface ponding, crusting and surface cover, and soil erosion index. Each indicator was given a visual \nscore of zero (poor), 1 (moderate) and 2 (good) based on the soil quality observed when comparing with \nthe field guide manual provided by Shepherd et al. (2008). We also scored 0.5 and 1.5 if the indicators \nfell between two categories. The score was then mu ltiplied by the weighting factor described in the \nmanual according to the importance of each soil indicator. The soil quality index is an aggregated sum \nof the adjusted indicators. Soil samples with a quality index of < 15 were classified as poor, 15 -30 as \nmoderate and >30 as good. \n2.6 Simple interpretation of yield map \nCotton lint yield maps of three fields (2017-18 season) were collected from the DeBortoli farm in the \nRiverina region of NSW. Management information and soil data were used to interpret the variation in \nthe lint yield. \n2.7 Statistical Analysis \nAll data analysis was carried out using Genstat (21 st Edition, VSN International Ltd). For each \ncomparison, the fields were considered as treatments with cores (9) as replicates. Soil parameter data \nwere analysed using Analysis of variance for each pair separately to assess the effect of treatments \n(fields) and soil depth as two factors and their interactions.  \n3 Results and discussion \n3.1 Cotton lint yield  \nIn the Gwydir comparison, the grower’s yield records (5 -year average) indicated that the average lint \nyield difference between the two fields investigated (Fields 1 and 2) was 522 kg/ha (2.3 bales/ha). \nSimilarly for the Macquarie Valley A and B comparisons, the grower’s yield records (5 -year average) \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n19 \n \n \nshowed an average lint yield difference between the two fields 284 kg/ha (1.25 bales/ha) for the first \npair (Fields 3 and 4) and 624 kg/ha (2.75 bales/ha) for the second pair. In addition, the measured yield \ndifference between the fields for the Riverina A comparison was 356 kg lint/ha (1.57 bales/ha) and that \nof Riverina B comparison was 806 kg lint/ha (3.55 bales) (Table 1.3). The 2018-19 season yield was in \na different trend to the 5-year average yield obtained from grower yield records for Gwydir and \nMacquarie comparisons. The 2018 -19 season was one of the driest seasons experienced by the \nAustralian cotton industry and yield for Gwydir and Macquarie comparisons deviated from the 5 -year \naverage trend. Due to the extreme climate induced growing conditions, it was proposed that the yield \nat these sites in this season was influenced by factors other than soil prop erties. The disease survey \nindicates the occurrence of fusarium wilt in one field in Gwydir and verticillium wilt in one field in \nMacquarie valley. Southern NSW paired sites were free of fusarium and verticillium wilt. \nTable 1.3.

Lint yield of paired sites measured during the 2018-19 season. The error bars indicate the \nstandard error of the mean. Each paired site is presented in the same colour and pattern. \n \n3.2 Bulk density and profile soil pH \nThere were differences in bulk density between the fields in each comparison except Riverina B \ncomparison. However, there was no  relationship between average bulk density and average lint yield \n(r2= 0.03) across the 10 fields. The bulk density of the soil is related to soil type (Indoria et al., 2020). \nThe soils of southern NSW exhibit texture contrast with Parna (aeolian depo sits) and fluvial deposits \nlayered over each other, prior to laser levelling to alter the landscape for irrigation and rice production \nin the past resulting in a mixture of these layers making drainage characteristics uneven and influencing \ntheir bulk density. The irrigated cotton-growing soils of the Gwydir Valley are predominantly cracking \nclays (Vertosols) with uniform clays upto 1 m depth (Zhao et al., 2019). The soil type and its origin \naccounted for the variability in bulk density across the regions, with the seasonal traffic or underly ing \ncompaction from previous season likely influencing the bulk density differences among the fields in \neach comparison (Table 1.4). The bulk density of the top 30 cm was within the normal range (~1.3 or \nlower) expected for Vertosols (Al-Shatib et al., 2021) that usually do not impact plant growth in all the \nfields expect Macquarie valley  (Fields 4 and 6) surveyed in this case study. The bulk density indicates \nfield 4 and field 6 were compacted compared to their pairs- field 3 and field 5. The measured lint yield \nin field 6 is significantly lower than field 5, however field 3 and 4 recorded similar yield in 2018 -19 \nseason (Figure 1.2). The magnitude of bulk density changes between 0 -15 cm and 15 -30 for fields 3 \nand 4 is 0.2 g/cm3. However, the magnitude of bulk density changes for the same depths for fields 5 \nand 6 are 0.2 and 0.4 g/cm 3 respectively. This higher magnitude of change in bulk density in field 6 \nindicates subsoil compaction and is a potential causal factor for the lower yield. A recent study reported \na 86% reduction in soil water recharge and 72% reduction in crop water use at 30-50 cm soil depth by \ncotton as a result of compaction (Jamali et al., 2021).  \nThe soil pH was alkaline throughou t the profile with increasing alkalinity from the topsoil to 90 cm \ndepth for all the fields (Tables 1.4, 1.5A and 1.5B) except fields 7 to 10 in Riverina where the soil pH \nwas acidic in the top 30 cm and neutral to alkaline from 30-90 cm depth for both fields (Table 1.6A and \n1.6B). \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n21 \n \n \nTable 1.4.

There was a \nclear difference in SOC at Gwydir comparison, where higher SOC was observed in the higher-yielding \nfields (Figure 1.3). There was also a trend of relatively higher SOC in topsoil (0 -15 cm) and also the \nwhole profile SOC stocks of high -yielding fields in all comparisons (Table 1.3, Table 1.4 to 1.6B). \nThere was a positive correlation between SOC stocks and normalised yield (P<0.05) (Figure 1.4). The \nSOC stocks of high -yielding fields were 2.5 to 12.3 t/ha higher than their low -yielding paired fields, \nwhich, at a typical C:N ratio of 10:1, means these field also had an additional 250 to 1230 kg/ha of \norganic N – a benefit for potential nitrogen mineralisation and thus less reliance on mineral fertiliser \nfor crop nutrition. The SOC of all the on-farm sites investigated was typically lower than that reported \nfrom three long -term experiments at the Australian Cotton Research In stitute (Rochester, 2011 ; \nHulugalle et al. , 2013 ; Nachimuthu et al. , 2018 ; Osanai et al. , 2020 ). The three long -term sites \nmaintained the crop rotation i ntegrity in every rotation cycle. However, commercial fields are often \nprone to extended fallow due to drought and lack of irrigation water availability. Mineral N levels were \nrelatively higher than recent research studies (Schwenke et al., 2022). This could be a result of timing \nof soil sampling that occurred after fertiliser application and before crop uptake. There was no \nrelationship between early season mineral N and cotton lint yield (r2 =0.04). However, Rochester and \nBange (2016) reported lint yield was posi tively correlated with pre -sowing soil nitrate in unfertilised \nplots. The lack of relationship between cotton lint yield and soil mineral N in our study suggest  the \ncombined fertiliser N and soil N measured are higher than soil nitrate N reported by Rochester and \nBange (2016) and there is potential to rationalise the nitrogen input. Previous research found that cotton \nplants often derive more N from soils than from applied fertiliser (Rochester and B ange, 2016 ; \nMacdonald et al. , 2017 ). A recent study conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute \nhighlighted that higher yields can be achieved with a lower N application rate (<155 kg N/ha) \n(Schwenke et al., 2022) compared to a higher industry average N application rate (CRDC, 2019). The \ntopsoil SOC of the experimental field in the study by Schwenke et al. (2022) was similar (~1%) to the \nother fields at the Australian Cotton Researc h Institute (Figure 1.3) and higher than the paired fields \ninvestigated in this study. Future studies on nutrient response comparing soils with higher and lower \nSOC will unravel the capacity of the soil to supply the plant nutrient demand and assist with optimising \nnutrient inputs. \n \nFigure 1.3.

(2004). In Macquarie -B comparison, the Colwell P values of the field 5 were \nsignificantly lower than the field 6 (Table 1.7B), however, the yield in 2018-19 season (Figure 1.2) was \nnot correlated with the Colwell P values. The Colwell P levels at 15 -30 cm of field 5 were lower than \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n26 \n \n \nthe critical Colwell P values (7 mg/kg) derived by Dorahy et al. (2004) for 0-30 cm. It is possible, the \nlong-term average lower yield in field 5 could be a combined effect of low native P fertility and P input \nnot matching the demand. The cotton crop in fields with lower Colwell P levels may have been limited \nfor P if P fertiliser was not part of the nutrient management plan. Previous studies on similar soils in \nthe Macquarie Valley found higher lint yield where P had been applied (Nachimuthu et al., 2022c). The \nColwell P soil test measures the fraction of soil P that is more readily available to crops . The BSES P \nsoil test includes Colwell P and additional P that is in other forms less available to plants. Once Colwell \nP is depleted by plant uptake, the P from the BSES P pool will slowly replenish the Colwell P (Moody \net al., 2013). This process will depend on various soil factors, such as mineral composition of soil, soil \npH changes, root acidification and microbial processes. Sporadic cotton yield responses have been \nreported to applied P in recent years (Nachimuthu et al., 2022b) and some of the responses occurred in \nsoils where the Colwell P value was above the previously suggested critical level (7 mg P/kg). The \noriginal study that derived the critical Colwell P values relied on P response studies that predominantly \nused banding as the method of P fertiliser application in the soil. However, recent studies indicated that \ncotton plants utilise P more efficiently if it is dispersed throughout the beds (Bell, 2014). A previous \nstudy suggested that the enrichment of soil with regular P fertiliser additions over the long term would \nbetter improve the P supply to the cotton plant than an immediate response in the same seas on of P \napplication (Griffith and Guppy, 2015). This could be a reason for the sporadic yield response to applied \nP in cotton. \nSoil exchangeable K levels in all the paired fields were above the critical values of 0.25 to 0.37 meq \nK+/100 g for clay soil (NutriPak 2018) and no interactions with yield and K was evident. \n3.5 Sodicity \nSodicity (ESP) was significantly different between paired fields for Gwydir, Macquarie -A and \nRiverina-B comparisons (Tables 1.4, 1.5A and 1.6B). Those fields with higher ESP (averaged across \n0-90 cm depth) had lower yields. The sodicity levels were well below the previously suggested values \nfor chemical toxicity, however, sodicity can result in dispersion and poor drainage (Dodd et al., 2013). \nThis would likely contribute to reduced root exploration, poor nutrient uptake, reduced cotton crop \nbiomass and lower SOC due to less biomass returned to the soil after harvest (Figure 1.5).  Sodicity is \nusually ameliorated by gypsum application and leaching, or else revised inputs to suit the lower yield \npotential. \n \nFigure 1.5. Different sodicity levels in paired fields (Average yield of fields 1 and 2 were 14.8 and 12.5 \nbales/ha respectively).

The lower-yielding \nfields in both Macquarie-A and B comparisons had lower Zn levels in topsoil (Table 1.4 and 1.5A) than \nhigh-yielding fields. Hot CaCl 2 extractable Boron levels were above the critical values (0.4 mg/kg) \nprescribed for a cotton crop response across all the sites in this case study (Table 1.4 to 1.6B). A recent \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n29 \n \n \nstudy on micronutrient changes over the long -term suggested that micronutrient availability was not \nrelated to the nutrient export associated with crop removal in fertile Vertosols, but noted that variable \nsoils of southern NSW cotton growing regions (e.g. Riverina, Macquarie) required further investigation \n(Palmer et al., 2023). \n3.7 Visual soil assessment \nThe soil quality index score of fields 1 to 6 was above 30 and classified as good under this assessment. \nMany cotton farms in Australia were developed on medium–heavy, cracking clay soils, with the shrink-\nwell properties acting to self -repair physical damage (Pillai-McGarry et al., 1994). In addition, soil \nmanagement has improved over time by adopting control traffic farming. For example, most Australian \ncotton farms now practice stubble incorporation into the topsoil, which improves the soil quality \ncompared to the raking and burning practices that existed in the past (NUTRIpak, 2018). The good soil \nquality index results are indicative of the role soil management provides in achieving the high yield \npotential expected in Australia, which is currently the highest in the world (Constable and Bange, 2015). \nThe average irrigated yield across the Australian cotton industry ranges from 10 to 12 bales/ha, which \nis around 50% of the potential theoretical yield of 22 bales/ha (Constable and Bange, 2015). There are \nother soil constraints, such as subsoil compaction induced by heavy machinery (that may not be assessed \nin this scoring index), that can significantly impact the cotton yield (Jamali et al., 2021). Crop rotation \nusing cereals and legumes within cotton -based cropping systems is often advocated as a potential \nsolution to improve soil physical properties (Hulugalle and Scott, 2008) and fertility (Rochester et al., \n2001; Rochester, 2011). While the soil quality  was ‘good’ using the visual soil assessment method, \nthere are still opportunities for improvement with soil management practices.  \nOne of the drawbacks of visual soil assessment is the biological indicator. Earthworms are the only \nbiological indicator assessed in this method and they were not detected during soil sampling across \nall the sites. This is similar to other visual soil assessments across Australian cotton regions, where \nearthworms were rarely sighted (out of 205 visual assessments). This is reflective of Eastern Australian \nhot climatic conditions during cotton production. We suggest the biological indicator assessment for \ncotton-growing soils in Australia may be modified using other indicators such as cotton fabric \ndegradation (Nachimuthu et al., 2022a), which would represent organic matter degradation under the \ncotton-growing conditions. The most parameters of the current visual soil assessment method account \nonly top soil except drainage and rooting depth. The current assessment method, providing visual soil \nquality index may not be sensitive  enough to predict cotton crop performance in cotton growing  \nVertosols of Australia and needs further refinement. \n3.8 Simple interpretation of cotton lint yield map \nAn investigation of the cotton lint yield map (2017-18 season) using management information and soil \ntest from the DeBortoli farm in the Riverina region suggested the zones or bays of the field that had an \naccidental missing of wheat crop rotation (Figure 1. 6A) in the previous winter (due to rain interfering \nwith planting) or the low yield points consisted of soil with higher subsoil sodicity (Figure 1.6B). The \nyield decline again re-emphasises the benefits of rotation crops , especially in southern NSW, where  \ngrowers tend to go back-to-back cotton. \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n30 \n \n \n \n \n  \nA)  B)  \nFigure 1.6 (A) The middle bay missed the wheat crop rotation in the previous winter resulting in lower \nlint yield in the 2017-18 season. (B) The red and yellow patches in the middle bay showing lower yield \nare the points matching the higher subsoil sodicity. \n \n4 Conclusion \nThis case study using the paired field comparison was helpful to identify differences in soil properties \nthat could be potentially causing yield limitations. Soil organic carbon stocks were correlated with \nnormalised lint yield percentage whereas early season soil mineral N or soil organic carbon does not \ncorrelate with current season yield. Soil sodicity and lower soil available P and Zn may be li miting \nproduction at some sites. The visual soil quality index was not a sensitive predictor of cotton crop \nperformance. This case study focussed on improving the understanding between the two fields at each \nsite. A similar approach could be undertaken to improve the understanding of within -field yield \nvariability by dividing the field into several zones and assessing each zone individually. \nAcknowledgement  \nWe acknowledge Janelle Montgomery, Amanda Thomas and Kieran O’Keeffe for their assistance with \nfield selection and help.

Here \nwe present a novel approach investigating the effect of compaction due to in-field traffic by continuously \nmonitoring crop canopy temperature and soil profile moisture and measuring crop yield in individual \ncrop rows to determine the economic impact on cotton farming systems. Traffic by a tractor weighing \n19.2 Mg either side of the plant row reduced lint yield by 27% due to lower crop height, leaf area, \nbiomass and fruit number. Elevated c anopy temperature (Tc) in the compacted plots resulted in 30% \nhigher stress time (i.e. cumulative time when Tc is higher than the optimum Tc for cotton growth) \ncompared with the non -compacted plots. Higher stress time in compacted plots was correlated with  a \n72% and 27% reduction in crop water use (estimated from change in soil water) at 0.3 - 0.5m and 0.5 – \n0.7m depths, respectively. Water recharge in the soil profile from irrigation and rainfall was reduced by \n16% due to compaction with the highest reduct ion being 86% at 0.3 – 0.5m depth. These results \ndemonstrate that compaction likely reduced root access to water below 0.3m inducing water stress \nresulting in yield reduction.  Tractors used for farm operations only compact one side of the bed, \nhowever, both sides are compacted in the absence of permanent wheel tracks. By comparison a dual tyre \nround module cotton picker weighing ~32 Mg compacts 67% of the rows on both sides and 33% on one \nside suggesting greater economic loss in the following season compare d to that estimated from the \ncurrent study. Reductions in soil water recharge following irrigation and rainfall events due to \ncompaction will further decrease farm efficiency and profitability. To our knowledge this is the first \nstudy related to soil compaction in any crop to show the direct relationship between yield, plant stress \ntime and soil water dynamics at specific depths in profile. It is suggested that short term agronomic \ndecisions (eg irrigation scheduling) need to be considered differently where  compaction has been \nidentified as limiting productivity. We recommend case studies be conducted to monitor the effect of \ncompaction on commercial farm productivity and to demonstrate the cost of compaction across \nagricultural industries to drive practice change. Demonstrating the potential economic consequences of \nsoil compaction by the integrated approach  used in this study may encourage practice change to \nminimize compaction on farms. \nKeywords \nSoil strength, canopy temperature, water stress, crop water use, soil water recharge \n1. Introduction \nMechanization has increased farm productivity by improving efficiency of operations and reducing cost \nof labour (Kutzbach, 2000). However, larger machinery with higher capacity increases subsoil (>0.4 m \ndepth) compaction due to higher axle loads (Keller and Arvidsson, 2004) . A recent Australian cotton \nindustry survey (CCA, 2020) suggested 66 percent of the surveyed cotton farms were impacted by soil \ncompaction. Cotton is mostly grown on Vertisol soils with high clay content and water-holding capacity \n(Isbell, 2016)  and with a history of intensive land preparation posing a greater  risk of structural \ndegradation (McGarry, 1990). In Australia, cotton is predominantly grown under irrigation (i.e. >80% \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n39 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nof area and >90% of production) with water applied frequently, resulting in high soil profile water \ncontent during the season (Roth et al., 2013)  and therefore subject to greater risk of compaction. \nAustralian cotton is grown predominantly in a cotton -wheat-fallow rotation with a range of farm \nmachinery used for different field operations (Table 2.1).  \nRecent research has largely focussed on the effect of modern pickers on soil compaction (Bennett et al., \n2019; Braunack and Johnston, 2014) . Operations conducted before and during the cotton season with \ncommonly available tractors can also result in soil compaction. In one example, cultivati on conducted \non wet soil before sowing resulted in 30% decrease in air-filled porosity and severely affected the crop \nwith many plants falling over at first irrigation, forcing the farmer to manage the crop as dryland causing \n70% yield loss (McGarry, 1990). In another case, a field cultivated wet (and hence compacted) required \ntriple the number of irrigations to maintain lint yield due to soil compaction thus significantly reducing \nwater use efficiency and adding to the cost of production associated with increased water use and labour \n(McGarry, 1995b).  \nCotton sowing may occur after an irrigation (pre -irrigation) or on dry soil followed by an irrigation, \nreferred to as watering up (ACPM, 2020) . Current industry recommendations for cotton sowing in \nAustralia are based on temperature and do not consider soil moisture per se (CSD, 2020). When rainfall \noccurs before sowing, farmers try to plant within a few days after rain to take advantage of the soil \nprofile moisture. This strategy results in saving an irrigati on which increases farm profitability in the \nshort term albeit at the risk of compacting soil. Most of the operations following sowing are conducted \nas necessary and often without flexibility to delay if soil is wet because of rain or irrigations. \nFertilizer is mostly applied a few weeks before sowing, however, it is recommended to apply a \nproportion of fertilizer during the season to match crop demand and reduce nitrogen losses (Schwenke, \nG, personal communication). In the pre-sowing phase, fertilizer is generally applied using a tractor under \ndrier soil conditions in the fallow season. The in -season fertilizer may be applied using a tractor either \nas side dressing or surface broadcast, water -run during an irrigation or surface broadcast by air. The \noperation to apply fertilizer with a tractor during the season can be a source of soil compaction as soil \nis relatively wet due to frequent irrigations. Inter -row cultivation is used for controlling weeds and \nRoundupTM ready volunteer cotton in furrows by disturb ing the topsoil (up to 15 cm) and, while it \nloosens soil near surface, it can be a potential source of compaction in subsoil (McGarry, 1990, 1995b). \nSprays of pesticides and insecticides are applied using either a ground rig or by air.  \nCotton harvesting i s performed using dual tyre round bale picker (32 Mg) which has the greatest \npotential to cause soil compaction due to greater weight of the machine and area under the wheels \ncompared with equipment (15 – 20 Mg) used to carry out other farm operations. In a study in Australia \n(Braunack and Johnston, 2014), cotton pickers increased soil strength to a depth of 0.6 m, with zones of \ngreater soil strength (>3MPa) observed closer to surface under the round bale picker (0.3 m) compared \nwith the basket picker (0.4 m). In another study (Bennett et al., 2019) , the round bale cotton picker \ncompacted soil to 0.8 m depth on 50% of sites.  \nSoil compaction has occurred in the Australian cotton production systems using the current agronomic \npractices as explained above (McGarry, 1990, 1995b). Annual tillage to 0.3 m depth does not alleviate \ncompaction in sub-soil. The soils of north western NSW, where most of the cotton is grown, are cracking \nclays with swelling/shrinking characteristics and have a strong potential to self -repair (Isbell, 2016). \nHowever, the self -repairing is limited to soil near the surface and several wetting and drying cycles \nwould be required to alleviate the effect of compaction in that layer (McGarry, 1995b). That is difficult \nto achieve in furrow irrigated cotton systems as the irrigation cycle is frequent (Roth et al., 2013).  \nIn cotton production systems, the effect of farm traffic on soil physical properties has been well \ndocumented through recent research (Antille et al., 2016; Bennett et al., 2017;  Bennett et al., 2019; \nBraunack and Johnston, 2014; Roberton and Bennett, 2017). It is important to understand the effect of \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n40 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \ncompaction on soil water dynamics (crop water use and soil water recharge) and plant water stress to \ndevelop a realistic picture of  productivity losses from compaction; however, research in this area is \nlacking. Low soil water availability causes stomatal closure reducing photosynthesis and increasing crop \nwater stress which can be assessed by measuring canopy temperature (Tc) (Idso et al., 1977; Jackson et \nal., 1981). Plants dissipate canopy heat load through transpiration, however, when access to water is \nreduced, stomatal closure is induced to conserve water resulting in elevated canopy temperature. Thus, \ncanopy temperature has an i nverse relationship with transpiration and stomatal conductance (Jones, \n1999). Plant growth is directly related to the cumulative time plants stay within their Thermal Kinetic \nWindow (TKW) which is species specific and is defined as a range of plant temper atures optimal for \nplant growth (Burke et al., 1988). Strong correlations between canopy temperature and cotton yield have \nbeen reported in Australian cotton systems (Conaty et al., 2015).  \nTo assess the impact of soil compaction on cotton productivity, an d to develop amelioration strategies \nit is important to understand the processes through which soil compaction affects farm productivity. For \nexample, compaction can affect water and nutrient use efficiency by restricting root growth (Arvidsson, \n1999). Quantifying the effect of compaction on water and nutrient uptake, and yield can also be used to \nassess the effectiveness of soil amelioration strategies to address soil constraints including soil \ncompaction and soil -borne disease. Such knowledge may also be valuable for farmers in developing \nstrategies to minimize the effects of compaction by changing agronomic practices within a cotton \ngrowing season. The loss of productivity caused by soil compaction is long -term and therefore less \nobvious to farmers than, for example, the effect of water stress. As such, farmers pay attention to \nimmediate agronomic decisions (e.g. water, fertilizer, and crop protection) compared to soil compaction. \nIt is important to demonstrate the link between soil compaction and agronomi c factors. For example, \nfarmers are more likely to increase efforts to avoid soil compaction if they see a direct link between soil \ncompaction, water use, plant stress, crop development and yield. \nThis case study aims to assess the effect of soil compaction on cotton productivity. We hypothesize that \nsoil compaction caused by infield traffic will increase stress time (i.e. cumulative time when Tc is higher \nthan the optimum Tc for cotton growth) by reducing access to soil water leading to negative affects on \nplant growth and resulting in yield and fibre quality penalties. This study is the first of its kind related \nto soil compaction in any crop and was aimed at investigating the relationship between yield, plant stress \ntime and changes in soil water at specific depths. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1 Site Description \nThis experiment was conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute, Narrabri (149°47′E, \n30°13′S), north-western New South Wales, Australia. The site has a semi-arid climate with a mild winter \nand a very hot summer. Long- term mean annual rainfall, calculated from an on-site weather station, is \n568 mm with more than 50 % of rainfall occurring during the cotton growing season (October-March).  \nThe soil at the experimental site is classified as Vertisol (grey cracking clay) according to Australian \nSoil Classification (Isbell, 2016), and is classified as a fine, thermic, smectitic, Typic Haplustert  (Soil \nSurvey Staff, 2010) or Grumic, sodic Vertisol (Pellic) (WRB classification). The soil in the experimental \nfield is alkaline (average pH in 0.01 M CaCl2 is 7.42 in the 0–0.3 m depth), non-saline (average electrical \nconductivity (EC 1:5) is 0.20 dS m-1 in the 0–0.3 m depth). The ESP was 2.9 at 0 –0.3 m. Detailed soil \ncharacteristics of this site are presented in Huluga lle et al., (2017). Daily rainfall and air temperature \n(Figure 2.1) were measured using an on-site weather station.  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n41 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n \nFigure 2.1: Rainfall and air temperature during the 2019-20 cotton season recorded from an on-site \nweather station \n2.2 Experimental layout  \nThe field used for this experiment was managed under a cotton -wheat-fallow or a cotton -sorghum \nrotation from 2002 until 2014. In 2014-15 all plots were planted with cotton and managed under wheat-\nlong fallow-cotton rotation until the start of this experiment. Standard agronomic practices (ACPM, \n2020) were used to manage these crops; however, cotton was harvested using a two -row basket picker \nfrom 2002 to 2008 and a four-row basket picker since 2008. This field has had not been exposed to the \ncompaction caused by heavier round bale pickers commonly used on commercial farms in Australia. \nField operations of sowing and fertilising were performed with four row implements which results in a \nhigher number of traffic passes than the commercial farms where 8 to 12 row implements are commonly \nused. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, cv. Sicot 748 B3F) was planted at a row spacing of 1m on 29 October \n2019 and irrigated two days later. The field was divided into eight plots: 4 m wide (4 plant rows) and \n30 m long ( Figure 2.2). All plots were sprayed with herbicide at sowing (Cotorn TM) and again on 4 th \nDecember 2020 (RoundupTM) using self-propelled spray coupe.  \nTable 2.1: List of different farm operations in a cotton-wheat-fallow rotation; the weight of machinery \nis indicative only \nCrop Operation Equipment mass (Mg) Number of passes \nCotton Land preparation 14-18* 1 -3 \n Planting 14-18 1 \n Fertilizer application 14-18 1-2 \n Inter-row cultivation 14-18 1 \n Spraying 15-16 2-7  \n Harvesting 28-32  1 \n Mulching 14-18 1 \n Root cutting 14-18 1 \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n42 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n Pupae busting 14-18 1 \nWheat Land preparation 14-18 1-3 \n Planting 14-18 1 \n Spraying 15-16 3-4 \n Harvesting 20-25** 1 \n*excluding implement weight which can be 4 to 5 Mg \n**excluding weight of grain stored in the bin on the machine \n \n \nFigure 2.2: Field layout showing position of four replicate plots; rows were in head ditch to tail drain \ndirection \nTreatments were a Control (CONT) and Compacted (COMP) with four replicates per treatment.

In COMP, furrows \non either side of the planted row had additional traffic four days after the first in -crop irrigation by a \nJohn Deere 8235R on 20 Dec 2019. The tractor was driven the full length of the plot in furrows labelled \n“1” (Figure 2.3) and then reversed effectively resulting in two traffic passes in those furrows. The same \nprocess was repeated in furrows labelled “2” (Figure 2.3). The tractor carried a go-devil implement on \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n43 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nrear and a 1200 litre tank of water on the front giving a total weight of 19.2 Mg ( Table 2.2).

Plants were counted in a subplot of \none-metre length that was randomly selected in each plot during the season. Plant growth was monitored \nby measuring plant height, number of nodes and number of fruit (squares, flowers, bolls) of 10 plants \nper plot on seven occasions between 13 Dec 2019 and 01 March 2020. At the end of the season or 124 \ndays after sowing (DAS), total dry matter was measured by harvesting plants (cut at ground level) from \na randomly allocated one meter in each plot. Three plants were sub-sampled and partitioned into stems, \nleaves and fruit, and dried in a fan forced oven at 60 °C for 48 hours or until constant weight was \nachieved. Total dry matter, vegetative dry matter (i.e. stems and leaves) and reproductive dry matter (i.e. \nfruit) was measured. Fresh leaves from the same three plants were used to determine the leaf area using \na planimeter (Model LI‐3100 Area Meter, Li‐Cor).  \n2.4 Soil strength and bulk density measurements \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n44 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nSoil strength was measured as cone index (CI) using a cone penetrometer (RIMIK, 12.3 mm diameter \ncone, 30° included angle) before and after traffic passes on 20th December, 2019 within a 1-2-hour time \nwindow (ASAE, 1986). In each plot, soil strength was measured in the centre of a plant row (row) and \nmiddle of the furrow (furrow) ( Figure 2.2). At each position, soil strength was measured at 0.025 m \nintervals to a d epth of 0.6 m. Treatment mean was calculated for each position and depth before and \nafter compaction. Average volumetric water content (VWC) measured using capacitance probes (see \nsection 2.6) at the time of traffic passes was 43%.   \n  \nSoil resistance measurements Trial showing difference in plant height \n  \nNon-compacted plot bed height (~15 cm) Compacted plot bed height (~29 cm) \nPlate 2.1: Soil resistance measurements and bed height difference between compacted and control plots \nAt the end of cotton season, dry bulk density was measured from both the middle of row and the middle \nof furrow (i.e. one core from each position and plot) before cotton picking operation. Soil cores were \ncollected by inserting a coring tube (diameter = 0.042 m) t o 1.2 m depth using a handheld post driver \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n45 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n(Christie Engineering, Australia). The core was divided into 0.1 m sections, dried at 105°C in oven for \n48 hours and bulk density calculated using the dry weight and volume of the core.  \n2.5 Canopy temperature \nCanopy temperature was measured using infrared sensors (Goanna Ag, Australia) installed in each plot \nafter the treatment application, however, data from two sensors (both in CONT) was excluded from \nanalyses due to large gaps in data. These sensors use a MLX90614-BCF lens (Melexis, Ypres, Belgium) \nwith a 35° field of view, resolution of 0.02 °C and an accuracy of ±0.5 °C from 0 to 50 °C. Temperature \nwas measured at 5 -minute intervals and data transmitted via LoRaWAN to an online platform for \nvisualizing in real-time and downloading. Sensors were installed at an angle of 45° to the horizontal and \nat a height of 20 -30 cm above the canopy. Height of the sensors was adjusted every week to maintain \nthis sensor position relative to the crop canopy. Canopy temperature was converted to stress time or \nstress hours using the Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive Console (BIOTIC) \napproach (Mahan et al., 2005). Briefly, when average Tc in a 15-minute interval was greater than 28°C, \nwhich is considered the o ptimal temperature for cotton (Conaty et al., 2012) , 0.25 stress hours are \ncounted. Stress hours were summed to calculate the cumulative stress time from few days after first \nflower (74 DAS) to when crop stopped accumulating stress (154 DAS), i.e. Tc remained < 28°C.   \n 2.6 Soil water \nSoil water was measured using capacitance probes (ODYSSEY®, Dataflow Systems, New Zealand). \nCapacitance probes were installed 45 days after sowing in the same plant row as canopy temperature \nsensors in each plot and measured soil moisture every hour at 0.1 , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8m depths. The \ncapacitance probe readings were calibrated using neutron moisture meter (CPN 503-DR Hydroprobe®, \nCPN International, Concord, CA) measurements at the same site to calculate volumetric water content \n(VWC) at different dep ths.  The VWC was converted to millimetres (mm) of water for different soil \ndepths by multiplying with the length of the soil section. Crop water use (CWU) for different soil depths \nwas calculated by accounting for decrease in soil water (mm) in hourly rea dings. Total CWU was \ncalculated by summing the hourly CWU values. Soil water recharge (SWR) for different soil depths was \ncalculated by accounting for increase in soil water (mm) in hourly readings. Total SWR was calculated \nby summing the hourly SWR values.   \n2.7 Yield and fibre quality \nSeed cotton was harvested with a single row spindle picker and weighed immediately.  A 10 m section \nin each plot was harvested from the same row where canopy temperature sensors and soil moisture \nprobes were installed. A 300-gram seed cotton subsample was ginned using a 20 saw gin with a pre -\ncleaner (Continental Eagle, Prattville, AL, USA) to determine the gin turnout (i.e. the percentage weight \nof seed and lint).  Cotton lint samples were analysed for fibre l ength (mm), strength (KN Tex -1) and \nmicronaire (unitless) using a spinlab High Volume Instrument (HVI) model Classing 900 (Uster \nTechnologies AG, Uster, Switzerland).  \n2.8 Statistical analysis \nData were processed using R software and statistical analyses w ere performed using GenStat 19th ed.  \n(VSN International, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Differences in treatments were determined using t -tests \nexpressed at the 95% confidence level (P < 0.05) unless stated otherwise. Simple linear regression was \nused to analyse t he relationship between yield, stress hours and soil water use. As cone index \nmeasurements taken early in the season showed large variability in background soil strength due to \nhistorical farm traffic, a multiple regression analysis was fitted to soil stre ngth after traffic to account \nfor background soil strength and profile depth.  \n3. Results  \n3.1 Soil strength and bulk density \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n46 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nThe soil strength results presented in this section were measured immediately before and after traffic in \nthe COMP treatment on the 20th December 2019. The vertical distance between top of row and base of \nfurrow was 0.14 m. The soil strength results are presented using the top of row as starting point which \nmeans measurements in furrow start at 0.14 m (Figure 2.4). Soil strength meas ured before traffic \nincreased with depth and ranged between 0.5 MPa and 3 MPa (data not shown). Soil strength did not \nchange in rows, however soil strength in furrows (ie under the wheels) increased by 0.1 – 0.2 MPa in \ntop 0.2 m with the highest strength o ccurring between 0.4 – 0.7 m depth with average soil strength \nincreasing up to ~0.6 MPa ( Figure 2.4). Multiple regression analysis showed that soil strength post \ntraffic was significantly affected by soil depth and soil strength measured before traffic ( Table S2.1). \nThis model accounted for 97% of the variability in soil strength measured after traffic in both the rows \nand the furrows. Soil strength measured before traffic had the greatest effect on soil strength measured \nafter traffic in both furrows and rows reflecting compaction from historic farm traffic. Bulk density was \nhigher in rows in COMP at 0 - 0.1 m depth compared with CONT, while in furrows, bulk density was \nhigher in COMP at 0 - 0.3 m depth with no change deeper in the profile compared to CONT (Figure \nS2.2).   \n \nFigure 2.4: Difference in soil strength profiles measured before and after traffic in rows and furrows; \nerror bars indicate the standard error of the mean \n3.2 Soil water \nIn addition to six supplemental irrigations, there was 362 mm of in-crop rainfall during cotton season of \nwhich >80% fell between January and March 2020 ( Figure 2.1). The soil volumetric water content \n(VWC) varied with depth. At 0.1 m depth, water extraction was similar between treatments, however, \nirrigation and rainfall events resulted in greater increase in VWC in CONT (Figure 2.5). At 0.2 m depth, \nthe VWC was similar between the treatments. The greatest effect of compaction on VWC was observed \nat 0.4 m depth where water extraction by plants was less in COMP resulting  in a lower water deficit \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n47 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nbetween irrigation and rainfall. In the first six weeks, the VWC in COMP gradually decreased from 45% \nto 40%. In contrast, the VWC in CONT decreased to <35% between irrigation and rainfall events in the \nsame period. The increase i n VWC following irrigation and rainfall events was less pronounced in \nCOMP compared with the CONT ( Figure 2.5). From 90 DAS onwards, both the water extraction and \nrecharge increased gradually in COMP albeit still less pronounced than in CONT ( Figure 2.5). Water \nextraction at 0.6 m and 0.8 m depth was minimal but marginally higher in CONT than COMP, likely \nbecause of better soil structure in the soil profile above this depth in CONT allowing water infiltration \nand root development deeper in the profile.  \nCrop water use (CWU) in CONT (846 ± 75 mm) was 16% higher than COMP (726 ± 87 mm). At \nindividual depths, the highest and statistically significant difference (CONT – COMP) of 72% between \ntreatments was observed at 0.3m – 0.5m depth (Figure 2.6). The treatment effect on CWU at other depths \nwas not significant. Soil water recharge (SWR) as a result of irrigation and rainfall mirrored the CWU \npattern (Figure 2.6) and was 16% higher in CONT (746 ± 60 mm) compared with COMP (657 ± 76 \nmm) for full soil profile (0 – 1m). At individual depths, the highest and statistically significant difference \n(CONT – COMP) of 86% between treatments was observed at 0.3m – 0.5m depth ( Figure 2.6). The \ntreatment effect on SWR at other depths was not significant. The similar pattern in CWU and SWR was \nfurther confirmed by a significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.99) between CWU and SWR (Figure 2.7).  \n \nFigure 2.5: Average volumetric water content at different soil depths measured using capacitance \nprobes; shade is showing the standard error of the mean \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n48 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n \nFigure 2.6: Average cumulative crop water use and average cumulative soil water recharge at different \ndepths in soil profile; treatment effect was significant at 0.3 – 0.5m depth in both crop water use (p \n<0.05) and soil water recharge (p <0.01) \n \n \n \nFigure 2.7: The relationship between crop water use and soil water recharge caused by irrigation and \nrainfall \n3.3 Canopy temperature \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n49 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nThe stress hours derived from the canopy temperature data were accumulated from 74 DAS until the \nstress accumulation stopped around 155 DAS (i.e. Tc remained below 28°C). Maximum daily canopy \ntemperature was frequently higher in COMP (data not shown). Under similar weather conditions, \ncanopy temperature is a function of plant-available water. As such, these results concur with soil water \nobservations ( Figure 2.6) which showed reduced water use in COMP treatment. Higher canopy \ntemperature in COMP resulted in a faster rate of stress accumulation compared with the CONT. At the \nend of the season, the average cumulative stress time was 30% higher in COMP compared with the \nCONT (Figure 2.8).  \n \nFigure 2.8: Average cumulative stress hours for each treatment starting from 74 days after sowing, \nerror bars are standard error of the mean \n3.4 Yield and crop development  \nThe average plant density in CONT (9.6 ± 0.3) and COMP (10 ± 0.3) were not significantly different.  \nLint turnout ranged 42-44% in different plots (data not shown). Average lint yield in CONT (2778 kg \nha-1) was significantly higher than COMP (2191 ± 33) – a difference of 27% (Table 2.3).  Compaction \nresulted in significant decrease of 19%, 56% and 21% in vegetative dry matter, reproductive dry matter, \nand leaf area, respectively, compared with the CONT ( Table 2.3). The field measurements showed \nnegative effects on plant growth parameters occurred within ten days of compaction. Compaction \nresulted in shorter plants with a smaller fruit load (squares and bolls) compared with the CONT (Figure \n2.8). The significantly lower number of squares in the COMP was a function of a smaller number of \nfruiting sites and/or higher fruit shedding in this treatment ( Figure 2.9).  Micronaire and fibre length \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n50 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nwere similar between treatments; however, fibre strength was significantly higher in COMP compared \nwith CONT (Table 2.3). \nTable 2.3: Biomass, yield and fibre quality (mean and standard error of the mean); different letters \nshow the significant differences (p <0.05) \nTreatment Vegetative dry \nmatter \nReproductive dry \nmatter  \nTotal dry \nmatter \nLeaf area Yield  Micronaire Fibre \nlength  \nFibre \nstrength \n Mg ha-1 Mg ha-1 Mg ha-1 m2 m-2 kg ha-1  mm g tex-1 \nCONT 7.5±0.3A 8.6±0.5A 16.1±0.8A 4.1±0.3A 2778±123A 4.7±0.1A 31.2±0.3A 30.2±0.4A \nCOMP 6.3±0.7B 5.5±0.2B 11.9±0.8B 3.4±0.5B 2191±33B 4.4±0.1A 31.4±0.4A 32.1±0.4B \n \n \nFigure 2.9: Plant growth characteristics measured on seven occasions over the course of season; error \nbars are standard error of the mean; significant differences (p<0.05) are shown by star (*) symbol; black \narrow is showing the date when compaction was applied to respective plots \n3.5 Relationship between crop water use, stress time and yield \nThe linear relationship between CWU and lint yield was only significant for water use at 0.3 – 0.5m \ndepth (Table 2.4). The relationship between C WU for the full profile (0 – 1 m) and lint yield was not \nsignificant. Similarly, the relationship between CWU and stress time (measured using canopy \ntemperature) was significant for 0.3m – 0.5m and for 0.5m – 0.7m (Table 2.4).

Discussion \nThis paper reports a novel approach to demonstrate the effect of soil compaction on farm productivity \nin irrigated cotton systems. To our knowledge this is the first study related to soil compaction in any \ncrop to show the direct relationship between yield , plant stress time and crop water use at specific soil \ndepths. Simultaneous monitoring of below ground (soil, water) and above ground (plants) parameters \nenabled better understanding of the mechanisms through which soil compaction affects farm \nproductivity. Soil compaction on both sides of planted rows from a tractor weighing 19.2 Mg resulted \nin lint yield loss of 27%. Yield losses of up to 29% associated with soil compaction have also been \nreported in cotton systems elsewhere (Kulkarni et al., 2010). Significant yield losses due to compaction \nhave also been reported in grain crops in Australia (Hussein et al., 2021; Li et al., 2007).  \nThe reduction in yield and crop water use were mainly a function of reduced crop water use at 0.3m – \n0.5m depth which was reflected in the significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.61) between yield and crop \nwater use at this depth: this relationship was not significant for other depths ( Table 2.4). The reduced \nwater use at 0.3 – 0.5m depth in COMP plots induced water stres s which is shown in the significant \nrelationship between total stress time and crop water use (R2 = 0.83) at this depth (Table 2.5). There was \nan equally strong relationship between crop water use at 0.5 – 0.7m depth and stress time which is an \nimportant finding and highlights that even the small differences in access to soil water at this depth can \nhave a disproportionally large effect on plant stress. A recent study in a rainfed sorghum showed 65% \ndecrease in rainfall use efficiency due to compaction using a simulation model (Hussein et al., 2021).  \nIt is important to note that reduced water extraction from 0.3 – 0.5m depth and, to a lesser degree, at 0.5 \n– 0.7m depth despite water presence indicates physical constraints to root penetration in sub-soil which \nwas also confirmed in increased soil strength at this depth (Hamza and Anderson, 2005; Raper, 2005). \nAlthough not measured, the physical constraints to root development caused by compaction can result \nin ‘L-shaped’ roots in cotton where roots start to g row laterally in the softer soil above the compacted \nlayer (McGarry, 1990; Taylor and Burnett, 1964). Compaction reduces soil porosity through degradation \nof soil structure which decreases the concentration of oxygen near root elongation zone. In irrigated  \nsystems, filling of soil pores with water further depletes soil oxygen levels. The low soil oxygen \nenvironment in the rootzone reduces root growth pressure thus slowing root penetration into the deeper \nsoil (Souty et al., 1988). Plants tend to compensate the lack of root access to deeper soil by increasing \nwater and nutrient uptake from the shallower soil layer (Nosalewicz and Lipiec, 2014). Thus, \ncompaction can limit the volume of soil for plant root proliferation and as a result, the plant’s ability to \nexplore and access additional available water and nutrients. Yield losses occur when plants are not able \nto fulfill their requirements for water and nutrients from the limited volume of soil that roots have access \nto (Arvidsson, 1999; Hussein et al., 2021; Phillips and Kirkham, 1962; Soane and van Ouwerkerk, \n2013). There is an ongoing interest in remote monitoring of soil water using contact and non -contact \nsensors including UAV, and satellite based systems to inform irrigation scheduling decisions (Al-Naji \net al., 2021) . These sensing systems need to start integrating the effect of compaction on soil water \navailability and its effects on economic yield loss.  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n52 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nThe strong linear relationship between crop water use and soil water recharge ( Figure 2.7) suggests \ncompaction affects both the processes in a similar fashion. In water -limited systems this relationship \nwould be interpreted as soil water recharge driving crop water use, however, this was not true in our \ncase as VWC data ( Figure 2.5) showed abundant water  present in soil profile at >0.3 m depths. The \ncontinuous measurements of soil water clearly showed compaction reducing the soil water recharge \nfollowing irrigation and rainfall events. Although not measured, this would likely have increased run \noff, based on research in grains system, where soil compaction decreased water infiltration by 12% thus \nincreasing surface runoff by 47% (Li et al., 2007). The increase in runoff can result in higher carbon and \nnutrient losses in hydrological pathways further impacting the on-farm sustainability (Macdonald et al., \n2020; Nachimuthu et al., 2018) . Soil water recharge was reduced by compaction, likely through two \npathways: 1) changes in soil structure creating physical constraints that reduced water infiltration to \ndeeper soil layers, and 2) reduced water extraction in COMP plots because of physical constraints to \nroot penetration below 0.3m depth resulted in smaller soil water deficits as shown in VWC data (Figure \n2.5) thus decreasing the volume of pores available for soil water recharge.  \nThese results demonstrated that compaction reduces farm productivity through multiple processes. \nContinuous measurements of canopy temperature quantified the effect of reduced water availability on \nplant stress as yield ultimately is a  function of stress as reflected in the significant linear relationship \nbetween yield and total stress hours ( Figure S2.3). The relationship between plant stress derived from \ncanopy temperature and yield is consistent with an earlier study conducted on the same farm in a nearby \nfield (Conaty et al., 2015) . Measurements of plant development during the season and destructive \nbiomass sampling showed that crop stress slowed plant development which had a cumulative effect on \nfinal yield. It is suggested that measurements of root development at different depths and laterally could \nadd value to the suite of measurements conducted in this study.  \n4.1 Implications for agronomic management \nThe reduction in crop water use because of compaction was most pronounced at 0.3 – 0.5m depth with \nsmaller changes in soil water content below this depth regardless of the treatment because of background \ncompaction from historic traffic. Irrigations in Australian cotton systems are predominantly scheduled \nby monitoring soil water in the root zone with an irrigation triggered when the soil water reaches a pre-\ndetermined target water deficit. As discussed above, compaction changes the root zone by restricting \nroot growth. The soil water data (Figure 2.5) shows that reduced water use would result in crop taking \nlonger to reach the target soil water deficit used to trigger an irrigation. Crop will likely suffer water \nstress in this situation unless irrigations are applied more frequently to compensate for the effect of \ncompaction. Although it is important to monitor soil water at the depth from which the roots are drawing \nthe water, and the extent to which soil water is being replenished following irrigation/rainfall, it does \nnot adequately inform irrigation scheduling decisions. The availa bility of soil water is affected by the \nseverity of compaction which can vary between years and locations. We suggest in addition to measuring \nsoil water, crop stress should also be measured using easier-to-use canopy temperature or other similar \napproaches that show the response of soil water availability (or lack thereof). When crop has limited \naccess to soil water (e.g. due to compaction), it shuts down its stomata in an attempt to conserve water \nresulting in elevated canopy temperature (Jones, 1999), as confirmed by our study where stress time was \nhigher in the COMP treatment. Thus, monitoring plants directly (eg canopy temperature) can inform the \ngrowers how soil compaction might be affecting soil water availability and may help optimize the timing \nof irrigation. In compacted soils minimizing crop water stress will require increasing the frequency of \nirrigations. In one example, in a field cultivated under wet conditions (and hence compacted) the farmer \nhad to triple the number of irrigations to match th e yield in non-compacted fields (12 versus 4) giving \nthe farmer enormous workload (McGarry, 1995b). In Australia, cotton is predominantly grown on soils \nwith high water holding capacity (eg Vertisols) and not being able to use water stored at depths below \n0.3m due to compaction is an underutilization of the increasingly scarce water resource. Thus, avoiding \ncompaction remains the best strategy to optimize water productivity.  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n53 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n4.2 Implications for soil management \nThe observed change in soil strength after traffic (Figure 2.4) and its effect on crop water use ( Figure \n2.6) shows the effect of compaction was most severe below 0.3m depth . The annual tillage operations \nto 0.3m will not alleviate the compaction effect in subsoil. Although the soils of north western NSW are \ncracking clays with swelling and shrinking characteristics, their potential to self-repair deeper soil layers \nis not clea r (Sarmah et al., 1996) . The self-repairing takes several wetting and drying cycles to make \nsignificant improvement from the effect of compaction and depends on factors such as clay content, clay \ntype and proportion of exchangeable cations (McGarry, 1995a; McHugh et al., 2009; Radford et al., \n2007). In order to minimise the time to repair the compacted soil, alternate strategies such as deep-rooted \ncrops or crop rotation need to be incorporated into the cropping system to improve the soil structure and \ncomplement the self -repairing capacity of these soils (Pillai and McGarry, 1999) . Ultimately, the \npotential of any method to repair the compacted soil will depend on the severity and depth of \ncompaction.  \nThe mantra of “prevention is better than cure” also app lies to the soil compaction issue. It has been \nsuggested that efforts should focus on the source of the problem (area trafficked by heavy machinery) \nrather than trying to solve the problem (compaction) after the fact (Bluett et al., 2019). Across the world, \nfarmers have adopted different approaches to minimize the effects of farm traffic on soil compaction, \nhowever, the idea of limiting the weight of machinery has largely been ignored as that would result in \nslowing down farm operations (Kirby, 2007). Soil compaction is considered a secondary issue for the \nmanufacturers of heavy farm machinery (Van den Akker et al., 2003) . The proportion of area that is \ncompacted when using heavy machinery can be decreased by adopting controlled traffic farming (CTF) \nwhich restricts the farm traffic to permanent traffic lanes. Controlled traffic farming has been shown to \nincrease yield and water use efficiency, and decrease losses through surface runoff (Hussein et al., 2021; \nLi et al., 2007). Although CTF is considered an effective and economically feasible approach to reduce \nthe effects of soil compaction on productivity (Antille et al., 2016; Bartimote et al., 2017; Bennett et al., \n2017; Hussein et al., 2021; McKenzie, 1998; Tullberg et al., 2007) , its adoption in Australia n cotton \nindustry has been slow. The lack of interest in CTF adoption despite scientific evidence of its benefits \nhas been attributed to a range of factors including incompatibility of equipment imported from Europe \nand North America, associated costs of conversion and its effect on warranties – e.g. converting a dual \ntyre cotton picker to a single tyre picker (Chamen, 2015; Tullberg et al., 2007). The loss of productivity \ncaused by soil compaction is long -term and therefore is less obvious to farmers than,  for example, the \neffect of water stress on yield. It is important to demonstrate the effect of soil compaction on agronomic \nfactors that are more visible to farmers during the cotton season. For example, farmers are more likely \nto take action if they see a direct effect of compaction on water use efficiency and yield. This action \nmay include attempts to avoid or minimize soil compaction and change in agronomic practices to \nminimize the effects of compaction within a cotton season. \n4.3 Economic impact to the industry \nThis case study demonstrates that farm machinery induced soil compaction impacts yield and \nconsequently results in economic losses. This study showed a significant reduction of 2.6 bales ha -1 (1 \nbale = 227 kg) in lint yield due to compaction fro m in-season traffic which equates to loss of A$1293 \nha-1 assuming the rate of A$500 per bale.  \nThese results are based on traffic wheels compacting furrows on both sides of all plant beds on a farm, \nhowever, on a typical cotton farm in Australia only a proportion of beds is compacted on either side by \nwheel tracks while most beds are compacted at least on one side depending on the type of farm \nmachinery. Both sides of the plant beds are also compacted when permanent wheel tracks are not used. \nHarvesting ope ration using a dual tyre round module picker is considered the biggest source of \ncompaction in Australian cotton production systems (Bennett et al., 2015; Braunack and Johnston, \n2014). The dual tyre configuration designed to pick six rows in each run leads to wheel track on either \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n54 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nside and single side of the plant beds in 67% and 33% of the farm, respectively. As a cotton picker is \nused at the end of season, the losses from picker related soil compaction would occur in the following \nwinter and summer crops (e.g. wheat and cotton). Growers can remediate soil to a degree during fallow \nusing soil amelioration practices such as deep ripping; however, this would require additional \ninvestment.  \nOther farm machinery would compact beds on one side only. A conservati ve estimate of yield loss of \ntwo bales per hectare in the rows compacted on both sides of the bed (i.e. 67%) by a round module \npicker would equate to a loss of A$670 per hectare in the following cotton season. The average area \nunder cotton production in Australia in last ten years (2009-10 to 2018-19) was 413,000 ha with average \ngross value of A$1.9 billion (ABARES, 2019). Yield loss of two bales per ha across 67% of the area \nunder cotton production is equivalent to $276 million loss across the industry (as suming a price of \nA$500 per bale). These estimates of loss at industry scale are indicative and need more investigation as \nthe timing and method of compaction application in this study is different to a commercial cotton farm. \nWe recommend detailed studies  should be conducted on commercial farms to quantify the effect of \ncompaction especially from harvesting operation using round bale picker with dual tyre configurations. \nThe economic gains from using modern pickers should be weighed against the productivity loss due to \nsoil compaction caused by such equipment. While the lightweight swarm bots are being trialled for \nvarious agricultural operations such as targeted weed control and future technological improvement \ncould lead to a light weight cotton harvesting bots, the cotton growers need to tailor the soil management \nto minimise the compaction until such technology is practical. \n5. Conclusions \nIn this paper we presented a novel approach of investigating the complex problem of soil compaction \nwhich can cause potential economic loss to growers using irrigated cotton as case study. Soil compaction \non both sides of the plant row increased plant stress time by 30% resulting in a significant yield loss of \n27%. The plant stress in compacted soil was likely caused by  physical constraints for roots to grow \nbelow 0.3m which was reflected in reduced water extraction by roots at this depth. In addition to direct \nyield loss, compaction also decreased crop water use and soil water recharge following irrigation and \nrainfall events. This study demonstrated the value of using canopy temperature as an indicator of crop \nwater stress, in addition to soil water, to inform irrigation decisions especially in situations where soil \nwater availability is reduced due to soil compaction. Although the timing and magnitude of soil \ncompaction might be different on a commercial cotton farm compared with this study, the processes \nthrough which compaction affects farm productivity will be similar. The methods presented in this paper \ncan be used to conduct similar studies on commercial farms of cotton and other crops to investigate the \neffect of compaction on yield and soil water dynamics in individual rows including the rows compacted \non one side only. Ideally, all efforts should be made to avoid  compaction, however, where this is not \nachievable, the implications for agronomic management should be considered to minimize yield losses. \nDemonstrating economic consequences of soil compaction to growers using the integrated approach \nused in this study may trigger practice change to minimize soil compaction on farms.    \nAcknowledgements \nThe Cotton Research and Development Corporation provided funding for this research.

We conducted a field investigation to assess the legacy effect of soil compaction, specifically, to \ninvestigate the number of years it takes to alleviate the soil compaction under field conditions. The \nresults of this study will improve grower’s understanding and amelioration of soil compaction. In this \nreport, we continue the monitoring of a simulated compaction experiment reported previously by Jamali \net al. (2021), which examined the impact of soil compaction on cotton production using canopy sensors \nand soil moisture probes. \n2 Methods \nThe experimental site is located on an alluvial floodplain in the lower Namoi valley —Field D1 at the \nAustralian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI) (30°11’42.98”S 149°36’52.86”E). A detailed description \nof the field and the treatments were presented by Jamali et al. (2021). This report details the results of \nthe original treatments on a wheat crop planted in the winter of 2020 and a cotton crop planted in the \nsummer of 2021-22. An additional treatment (semi -compacted as described below) was also included \nin the 2021-22 season. The treatments included \n1. Control (non-compacted) \n2. Compacted (Furrows compacted on either side of the bed) \n3. Semi-compacted (Furrows compacted on one side of the bed) \nCrop management was similar to the trial explained in Chapter 2. Soil water use was measured in each \nplot (one position per plot) using a neutron probe moisture meter and soil penetrometer resistance was \nmeasured at the top of the bed in each plot, as described by Jamali et al. (2021). \nPlant biomass samples were taken from 1 m 2 per plot from late March to early April b y taking whole \nshoot and bolls. Samples were dried at 60o C until constant weight and the final dry biomass recorded. \nDisease incidence was recorded in the 2021 -22 season by counting the number of plants with visual \ninfection symptoms per square metre and reported as a percentage of all plants sampled. \nCotton was handpicked from 1 m2 per plot for yield estimation. A sub-sample of cotton was ginned to \ncalculate the lint and seed turnout.  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n62 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nAll the statistical analysis was carried out using Genstat 18.2 (VSN International Ltd) using analysis of \nvariance of a randomised block design with four replications . Probabilities <5% were considered \nsignificant. \n3 Results and discussion \nThe wheat yield results showed no significant difference between control and compacted plots (Figure \n3.1). The lack of difference in wheat yield could be the result of sufficient rainfall recharging the soil \nprofile during the season to overcome the traditional limitations of soil water extraction caused by plant \nroots due to compaction. \n \nFigure 3.1. Wheat yield as influenced by soil compaction (bars are standard error of the mean)  \nThere was also no legacy effect of soil compaction on cotton lint yield at  harvest or on any agronomic \nparameters measured at the maximum biomass stage (Table 3.1). There was also no difference between \nsemi-compacted and control or compacted plots. However, there was an inverse relationship between \ndisease incidence with compaction. The fully compacted plot recorded no disease incidence and semi -\ncompacted plots recorded lower disease incidence than the control plots (Table 3.1). The reason for \nlower disease incidence is not clear as root biomass was not assessed.  \nTable 3.1.

Soil resistance can be influenced by soil moisture, so the \npenetrometer readings were conducted when the soil water content was similar for all plots (Table 3.2). \nThere was a difference in soil resistance and soil water content during the 2019 -20 season between \ncompacted and control plots (Jamali et al., 2021). Previous research indicated that, it can take up to five \nor six wetting and drying cycles to self -repair the soil compaction in cotton growing soils of Australia \n(Pillai-McGarry et al., 1994). Our results over two cotton seasons suggest that soil compaction caused \nby heavy machinery of ~19.2 tonnes in this cracking soil with 62% clay content may be repaired after a \nsingle wheat rotation crop in similar seasonal conditions from 2020 to 2022. \n \nTable 3.2.

The self-repair potential of \nVertosols with a clay content of 62% likely assisted the natural and wheat rotation-mediated alleviation \nof soil compaction. Future investigation needs to repeat this research on a greater range of soils typically \nused for irrigated cotton production, focusing on the time required to repair th e compacted soil using \nnatural and rotation crop tactics. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was undertaken as part of DAN1801 funded by Cotton Research and Development \nCorporation and the NSW Department of Primary Industries.

Leaving it as standing stubble will minimise the tillage and \nenergy use. \n• Wheat standing stubble system resulted in higher wheat yield (wheat planted after \ncotton) than wheat stubble incorporated during drought. \n• Standing stubble will minimise atleast two tillage operations and overall traffic \nwithin the cotton farms and improve the productivity and sustainability of irrigated \ncropping systems \n1 Introduction \nCover crops are often postulated to improve soil health. They are reported to enhance soil physical and \nchemical properties, crop productivity, soil carbon and nutrient cycling. However, studies questioning \nthe benefits of cover crops also exist in the scientific literature. In Australia, cotton -based irrigated \ncropping systems result in better gross margins for g rowers than exclusively grain -based irrigated \ncropping systems. The benefits of crop rotation on nutrient cycling, soil carbon (Rochester, 2011) and \nsoil physical properties (Hulugalle and Scott, 2008)  within the Australian cotton cropping  system are \nwell established. The benefits of vetch as a cover crop rotation whether mulched as surface mulch \n(Hulugalle and Scott, 2008; Hulugalle et al., 2010)  or incorporated (Rochester, 2011) in a two -year \nrotation cycle was reported earlier.  As cotton is a high -value crop, designing a cropping system that \nincludes cotton every summer with winter break crops may improve the gross margin and productivity \nof cotton cropping systems in Australia. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the \neffectiveness of winter cover crops (Oats) in improving the soil health, cotton productivity and gross \nmargin of cotton cropping systems under minimum tillage. Continuous cotton with and without a cover \ncrop was compared among themselves and against cotton wheat systems with two different methods of \nstubble management. \n2 Methods \nThe experiment was conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI). (149047׳E, 30013׳S) \nnear Narrabri in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The soil is a deep uniform self-mulching grey clay \n(Isbell RF, 2021)  and is classified as a fine, thermic, smectitic, Typic Haplustert (Soil Survey Staff, \n2010). The mean annual rainfall for the  region between 1993 and 2020 was 618 mm (Longpaddock, \n2020). The area has a semi-arid climate and experiences four distinct seasons with a mild winter and a \nhot summer. The soil’s mean particle size distribution at 0–1.2 m depth was (per 100 g soil): 64 g clay, \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n66 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n11 g silt, and 25 g sand. Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) was 4% at 0-0.6m and 12% at 0.6–1.2 \nm depths. \nThe experiment initially included four crop rotation systems with cotton as the main crop. All the \ntreatments were maintained as a permanent bed system. In 2020, a fifth system was introduced by \nsubdividing the cotton-wheat [standing stubble] system into two by retaining the historical system and \nintroducing chickpea rotation (T5 as described below). The five systems currently under investigation \nincluded \nT1: Cotton-Oats (summer cotton–winter oats–summer cotton) \nT2: Cotton monoculture (summer cotton–winter fallow–summer cotton) \nT3: Cotton-Wheat [stubble incorporated]- Cotton (summer cotton–winter wheat– summer and winter \nfallow–summer cotton) \nT4: Cotton -Wheat [standing stubble] - Cotton (summer cotton –winter wheat – summer and winter \nfallow–summer cotton) \nT5-Cotton- Chickpea [standing stubble]- Cotton- Wheat [standing stubble]- Cotton- Chickpea [standing \nstubble]- Cotton \nIn T3, the wheat stubble was incorporated into the beds after harvest with a disc hiller. Treatment T1 \nwas formerly cotton –vetch–cotton until 2013. Treatment T5 was subdivided from T4 in 2020 when \nchickpea was introduced.

All the crops in the rotation system were irrigated by furrow irrigation systems with siphons \n@ 1ML/ha (~100 mm) when the rainfall was insufficient to meet the evapotranspiration demand. Cotton \nwas picked from late April to late June with a 4 -row picker after defoliation in April. After cotton \npicking, the cotton was slashed and incorporated into the beds with a disc -hiller. The paddock was \nprepared for cropping using minimu m tillage (permanent beds) with tillage operations (disc -hilling) \nrestricted to the bed after cotton picking. Wheat, chickpea and oats crops were irrigated, although the \nrequirement for irrigation was minimal during winter and spring. During drought years, the winter and \ncover crops were only irrigated after planting for establishment in order to save water for the summer \ncotton crop. The oats were sprayed out in September before maturity and cotton was sown directly into \nthe oat stubble in October/November each year. \nCotton growth parameters were periodically recorded. Monitoring included the number of nodes, plant \nheight, green bolls and opened bolls. However, there were occasions where high rainfall limited access \nto the field suspending monitoring. Plant biomass samples were taken from 2 m2 quadrats in each plot \nbetween late March to early April. Whole shoots and bolls were collected and dried at 60 oC until \nconstant weight with the dry biomass recorded. Disease incidence (% of infected plants/m2) was visually \nassessed in the cuts made during the 2021–22 season. \nCrop yield was estimated by harvesting the economic produce (cotton, chickpea or wheat) in the middle \n4 to 8 rows of each plot using a mechanical harvester. A sub -sample of cotton was ginned to calc ulate \nthe lint and seed turnout. In 2021 and 2022, a hand harvest of 3 m 2 per plot was performed due to \nelectronic faults with the picker scale. Economic analysis and gross margins of the cropping systems \ninvestigated are described in Chapter 5.  \nSoil strength was measured as cone index (CI) using a cone penetrometer (RIMIK, ~12.5 mm diameter \ncone, 30° included angle) at 10 positions from head ditch to tail drain in each plot. At each position, soil \nstrength was measured in the centre of a plant row (row), in the middle of the furrow (furrow) and the \nside of the bed. Measurements were made at 1.5 cm intervals to a depth of 45 cm. The treatment mean \nwas calculated for each position and depth before and after compaction. \nSoil samples (0 -1.2 m at increments of 0.0-0.10, 0.10-0.30, 0.30-0.60, 0.60-1.2 m depth) were taken \nfrom all four replications during September/October of each planting season and analysed for SOC using \nthe Walkley and Black method (Method 6A1) (Rayment and Lyons, 2011) during 2018 and 2020.  \nSoil temperature (5 cm depth) was monitored at one position per plot within plant line during  the two \nseasons using Tinytag plus2 (Gemini data loggers (UK) Ltd, Chichester, West Sussex PO198UJ, UK).  \nSoil water content at various depths from 10 to 120 cm was measured during 2018-19 to 2021-22 seasons \nwith a neutron moisture meter (CPN 503 -DR Hydroprobe®, CPN International, Concord, CA) which \nhad previously been calibrated for this paddock (Hulugalle et al., 2013) . Topsoil (0-10 cm) soil water \ncontent was measured gravimetrically. Soil water storage was calculated before every irrigation and \nseasonal average soil water storage before the irrigation were presented. \nAll statistical analyses were ca rried out by Genstat 18.2 ( VSN International Ltd ) using analysis of \nvariance of a randomised complete block design. \n3 Results and discussion \nCotton lint yield results are summarised in Table 4.2. The cotton -wheat rotation [wheat stubble \nincorporated] or [standing stubble] resulted in better lint yields than cotton monoculture or cotton -oats \ncover crop rotation. There was no significant difference between wheat [stubble incorporated] or wheat \n[standing stubble] systems. Leaving wheat stubb les on the soil surface without tillage will reduce the \ntraffic and energy use within a cotton -wheat cropping system and therefore improve the overall \nsustainability of the cotton production system. \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n69 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 4.2.

The lack of yield benefit may be due to immobilisation of mineral nitrogen by \nthe oats stubble leading to early-season N deficiency. The cotton crop gown after oats exhibited visibly \npaler green leaves compared to the monoculture treatment (T2). Seasonal average soil temperature \nduring the 202 0-21 season was lower (P<0.05) in the cotton -wheat (22.39 oC) than the cotton \nmonoculture (22.65oC) and the cotton -oats (22.84oC). There was no interaction between months and \ntreatments in soil temperatures (Figure 4.3A). A similar trend was observed in the 2021-22 season with \ncotton-wheat (24.31 oC) ≈ cotton -chickpea (24.45 oC) < cotton -oats (25.40 oC) ≈ cotton monoculture \n(25.17 oC). These results indicate that soil temperature in the cotton -oats system was not lower than \nother treatments earlier in the season (Figure 4.2). The observed results could be a factor of good canopy \ncover in cotton-wheat and cotton-chickpea rotation compared to the other two treatments in later months \nfrom February to March in both years.  \nIn addition, the cotton-oats cover crop system experienced more traffic compared to cotton monoculture, \nwith in -crop operations necessarily carried out within a narrow time window between the oat crop \nharvest and cotton planting. As a result, some field operations were conducted at inappropriate soil \nmoisture contents that can lead to soil compaction. The soil resistance within the cotton-oats system was \nhigher when compared with the cotton -wheat systems but similar to cotton monoculture (Figure 4.1). \nThis indicates the cotton monoculture and cotton-oats systems were compacted due to less fallow time \ncompared to the cotton-wheat system with long fallow and a greater oppor tunity to self-repair through \nthe swelling and shrinking of the clay in the soil. \nDisease (verticillium wilt) assessment in the 2021-22 season showed high variability between plots. The \nresults (Figure 4.3) indicated a trend of incidence: cotton monocultur e > cotton -oats > cotton -wheat \n[standing stubble] ≥ cotton-chickpea> cotton-wheat [stubble incorporated]. The oats cover crop system \nwas second worst in terms of disease incidence and therefore not an effective break crop, compared to \nwheat in a two-year rotation cycle. \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n70 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n \nFigure 4.1.

However, stubble management did not influence wheat yield in the other years when there was \nsufficient in-crop rainfall (Figure 4.5). This suggests that the wheat standing stubble system improved \nresilience during drought and can improve the water use efficiency of the cotton-based cropping system. \nThe soil re sistance (compaction) was also lower with the wheat standing stubble system (Figure 4.1) \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n72 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \ncompared with all other cropping systems. Similarly, there was no difference in wheat yield between \ncompacted and control plots during wet years in another trial withi n the same field (Chapter 3). The \nsufficient rainfall during the season was able to overcome the soil compaction-induced water limitations. \nThe long -term gross margin/ML of water was always higher for cotton -wheat systems than cotton \nmonoculture (Chapter 5). \n \nFigure 4.4.

In 2018-19, the field was impacted by hail storms and \nthere was high variability with the cotton plant regrowth. The 2021-22 season had higher-than-average \nsummer rainfall and this might have contributed towards the lack of difference in soil water storage. \nHowever, in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons, the soil water storage under the cotton -oats cover crop \nsystem was greater than in the cotton -wheat stubble incorporated systems (Table 4.3 and Table 4.4). \nThis suggests that the cover crop improved water infiltration and soil porosity resulting in higher soil \nwater storage. However, the following cotton crops were unable to benefit from the increased soil water \nstorage, either due to irrigation supplying adequate water or due to some other constraints brought about \nby the cover crop (Table 4.2). \n \nFigure 4.5. Monthly rainfall total from July 2017 to June 2022 \n \nThe soil organic carbon concentrations in field D1 indicated a decline in 0 -30 cm depth from 2018 to \n2020. The SOC at lower depths (>30 cm) were similar before planting over two years (Figure 4.6). The \ndecline is due to the drought conditions and this was reflected to low winter crop yield (Figure 4.4).

The total gross margin per ha for the rest of the \ntreatments ranged between $2,971/ha for T3a and $4,640/ha for T1. \n▪ Gross margins for treatments varied across all treatments due to variations in yield, \nvariable costs, and crop sequences.  However, continuous cotton (T2) consistently \nreturned the highest average gross margin per hectare, between 8% and 38% higher than \nthe gross margin for other treatments. \n▪ The gross margin performances of cotton -wheat rotations were higher than the rest of \ntreatments. \n▪ When water is the limiting factor, T4 (cotton-wheat-vetch) returned the highest gross \nmargin per ML. \n1 Introduction \nThis report presents the gross margin analysis for the results of the ACRI Field D1cotton trial conducted \nin Narrabri from winter 2019 to summer 2020/21 cropping seasons. The gross margin for the treatments \nthat were compared within the D1 trial were: \nT1 = Cotton-oats-cotton-oats (C-O-C-O), after 2013 oats was substituted for vetch. \nT2 = Cotton-winter fallow-cotton-winter fallow (C-F-C-F) \nT3a = Cotton-wheat-long fallow; wheat stubble incorporated (C-W-F-F) \nT3b = Long fallow-cotton-wheat; wheat stubble incorporated (F-F-C-W) \nT4a = Cotton-wheat-fallow-vetch; wheat stubble retained (C-W-F-V) \nT4b = Fallow-vetch-cotton-wheat; wheat stubble retained (F-V-C-W) \nAlso Treatment 5 was introduced to test chickpea in the rotati on, it was split from T4b, with chickpea \nto be grown instead of wheat. \nThe type of budget used in this analysis is gross margin. A gross margin is the gross income from an \nenterprise less the variable costs incurred in achieving it. Variable costs are those costs directly \nattributable to an enterprise and which vary in proportion to the size of an enterprise. For example, if \nthe area of cotton sown doubles, then the variable costs associated with growing it, such as seed, \nchemicals, and fertilisers, will also roughly double. \nThe gross margins reported here are not the same as gross profit, because they do not include overhead \ncosts such as depreciation, interest payments, rates, or permanent labour which have to be met \nregardless of enterprise size. While simple gross margin analyses are useful at the enterprise scale, \ninvariably a more thorough analysis at the whole farm scale is required to assess financial impacts of \ndifferent cropping rotations over a longer period. \nFor the purpose of this analysis, commo dity prices and input costs are kept constant across years to \navoid confounding the treatment results with the impact of price variability. Gross margin (GM) results \nwere calculated using the following long-term average prices; \n▪ cotton lint price of $450 per bale,  \n▪ cotton seed price of $170 per tonne  \n▪ chickpea price of $500 per tonne \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n77 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n▪ wheat price of $295 per tonne for 14% protein (ex-farm) and  \n▪ estimated costs for the actual operations conducted on each treatment, including fallow costs. \nPrices are kept the s ame across the years to avoid confounding the treatment results with \ncommodity price variability. Results are presented on both gross margin per hectare (GM/ha) \nand gross margin per megalitre (GM/ML) basis. \nGross margin for one hectare of cotton assumed gross margin for the associated refuge crop. In the 2019 \nand 2020-21 seasons, Bollgard® 3 varieties were planted with unsprayed conventional cotton grown as \nthe refuge. For every hectare of Bollgard® 3 cotton grown, there was 0.025 hectare of unsprayed cotton \nfor refuge. Therefore, in the gross margin comparison of one hectare of cotton is 97.5% Bollgard® 3 \nand 2.5% unsprayed conventional cotton. The yields shown are the full yield/ha for the Bollgard® 3 \ncotton, but the income, costs and gross margi ns reported are all 97.5% Bollgard® 3 and 2.5% refuge \ncrop when cotton is grown. \n2 Results  \nWinter 2019 season  \nIn winter 2019, T3a and T4a were sown to wheat. The wheat yields for T3a and T4a were very low, the \noats sown in T1 was sprayed out and green manured. The rest of the treatments were fallowed with little \nor no operations (Table 5.1). \nTable 5.1: Winter 2019 season results \n T1 T2 T3a T3b T4a T4b T5 \n2019 C-O-C-O C-F-C-F C-W-F-F F-F-C-W C-W-F-V F-V-C-W F-V-C-W \nCrop oats fallow wheat fallow wheat fallow fallow \nYield (t/ha)   0.53  0.98   \nProtein %   0.16  0.16   \nScreenings %   21.00  21.00   \nWater use (ML/ha) 1.00  1.00  1.00   \nIncome ($/ha)   129  239   \nVariable cost \n($/ha) \n279 11 387  328   \nGross margin \n($/ha) \n- 279 - 11 - 258  -89   \nGross Margin \n(ML) \n-279  -258  - 89    \n \nSummer 2019-20 season  \nThe summer 2019 -20 season saw all treatments grow cotton crop except T3a and T2a which were \nfallowed after growing wheat in the winter 2019.

Recent research where P fertiliser \nwas mixed throughout the plant bed showed an increase in lint yield in soils with Colwell P above the \ncritical level typically recommended for a lint yield response (Dorahy et al., 2004; Nachimuthu et al., \n2018). Cotton responses to P application vary, with different critical P levels reported in the literature \n(Bronson et al., 2001; Crozier et al., 2004) . However, there is limited research on lint yield responses \nbeyond the season of application. This study examined the yield response over two sucessive seasons to \nP fertiliser added to an oats cover crop before the first cotton crop. \n2 Methods \nThe experimental site is located on an alluvial floodplain in the lower Namoi valley —Field D1 at the \nAustralian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI) (30°11’42.98”S 149°36’52.86”E). The field has an area of \n4.53ha, is 170 meters long. The P experiment was superimposed onto a cover crop rotation treatment \nwithin a long-term tillage rotation experiment (Oats/Cotton/Oats) with thre e replications. The soil is a \ndeep uniform self-mulching grey clay (Isbell RF, 2021) and is classified as a fine, thermic, smectitic, \nTypic Haplustert (Soil Survey Staff, 2010). The mean annual rainfall for the region between 1993 and \n2020 was 618 mm (Longpaddock, 2020). The area has a semi-arid climate and experiences four distinct \nseasons with a mild winter and a hot summer. The mean particle size distribution at 0–1.2 m depth was \n(per 100 g soil): 64 g clay, 11 g silt, and 25 g sand. Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) at 0 -0.6m \nand 0.6–1.2 m depths were 4 and 12 respectively. \nIn September 2015, 6 cores were collected to 120 cm from across the paddock. Each set of two cores \n(head ditch and tail drain ends) were composited by depth before analysis. The data in Table 6.1 is an \naverage of three composite samples. \nField D1 is a long -term rotation and selected plots from this field that were used for the 2019 -22 \nexperiment formed part of a cotton-oats-cotton rotation. The field crop operations from 2018-19 to 2020-\n21 were described in Schwenke et al 2021. During 2021 -22, we examined the legacy effect of the \nprevious year’s P fertiliser timing and method of applica tion treatments. The experiment consisted of \neight treatments replicated three times in a strip-plot design: \n• P banded before oats \n• P banded before cotton \n• Banding control oats (no P applied, but equipment used for banding passed through these \nplots) \n• P banded control cotton (no P applied, but equipment used for banding passed through these \nplots) \n• P incorporated (mixed) before oats \n• P incorporated (mixed) before cotton \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n88 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n• Incorporated control oats (no P applied, but operations used to apply and mix P were \nconducted) \n• Incorporated control cotton (no P applied, but operations used to apply and mix P were \nconducted) \nPlanting of cotton (Var Sicot 748 B3F) occurred in late October 2021. The crops were irrigated by \nfurrow irrigation systems with siphons @ 1ML/ha (~100 mm) if the rainfall was insufficient to meet the \nevapotranspiration demand. After cotton picking, the cotton was slashed and incorporated into the beds \nwith a disc-hiller. Land preparation was minimum tillage (permanent beds) with tillage operations (disc-\nhilling) restricted to the bed after cotton picking. The oats cover  crops were irrigated, although the \nrequirement for supplemental watering was minimal during winter and spr ing. The oats were sprayed \nout in September, prior to maturity and cotton was sown directly into the oat stubble in \nOctober/November each year. \nTable 6.1 - Baseline soil characteristics of experimental plots within Field D1,  \nAnalyte 0-10 cm 10-30 cm 30-60 cm 60-120 cm \nSoil pHCaCl2 7.36 7.43 7.45 7.53 \nSoil pHwater 7.75 8.09 8.30 8.32 \nElectrical conductivity 157 154 216 276 \nSoil OC (g/100 g) 0.85 0.84 0.38 0.32 \nExchangeable Ca (cmol (+)/kg) 18.33 18.67 16.33 14.00 \nExchangeable Mg (cmol (+)/kg) 10.30 11.33 12.33 13.00 \nExchangeable Na (cmol (+)/kg) 0.86 1.37 2.73 3.93 \nExchangeable K (cmol (+)/kg) 0.88 0.63 0.55 0.57 \nSodicity (Exchangeable Sodium %) 2.8 4.3 8.5 12.4 \nColwell P (mg/kg) 24.6 14.4 15.4  \nBSES P (mg/kg) 185 172 181  \nSolution P (mg/kg) 0.103 0.045 0.061  \nClay (%) (mean particle size 0-1m) 64 \nSilt (%) (mean particle size 0-1m) 11 \nSand (%) (mean particle size 0-1m) 25 \n*- results are from 2002 samples \nCotton growth parameters were monitored periodically to assess the vegetative growth rate (data not \npresented).

Disease incidence was recorded in the 2021 -22 season by counting the number \nof plants with visual infection symptoms per square metre and reported as a percentage of total plants \nsampled. \nCotton was handpicked from 1 m2 per plot for yield estimation. A sub-sample of cotton was ginned to \ncalculate the lint and seed turnout.  \nAll the statistical analysis was carried out using Genstat 18.2 ( VSN International Ltd ). Analysis of \nvariance using a three-way factorial randomised block design with method, timing and fertiliser as three \nfactors. \n3 Results and discussion \nCotton lint yield results from 2020 -21 and 2021 -22 are summarised in Table 6.2 and Table 6.3. \nApplication of P fertiliser before oats cover crop resulted in better lint yield than apply ing P before \ncotton in the 2020 -21 season (Table 6.2). However, this applied P did not have any further impact on \ncotton yield in the subsequent season (2021-22) (Table 6.3). A previous trial within the same field also \ndemonstrated there was no legacy effe ct of applied P on cotton lint yield (Schwenke et al., 2021) . \nAlthough mixing the P fertiliser throughout the beds resulted in higher cotton total dry matter (Figure \n6.1), there was no effect of the method of P application on cotton lint yield.  \nTable 6.2.

Legacy effect method of P application on cotton plant dry matter (t/ha) \nAs there was no legacy effect of applied P on agronomic parameters other than dry matter, we presented \nthe average values across all the plots. The average plant height, the number of nodes and disease \nincidence were 81 cm, 22.5 nodes and 37% respectively. \nThe soil Colwell P levels were 25 mg/kg in the topsoil (0 -10 cm) and 14 mg/kg in the subsoil (10 -30 \ncm). The BSES P (Table 6.1) is a slowly available source of P in the soil that replenishes the Colwell P \nwhen the plant uptake is not matched by fertiliser input. However, in this soil, there has been long-term \nmining of P by the continuous cropping, i.e. P export in cotton seed and grain has not been replaced by \nfertiliser inputs. As a result, newly applied P may be adsorbed or fixed to slowly available P pool thus \npreventing any legacy effect of applied P. Future research needs to quantify the amount of applied P \nmoving into BSES P pool to improve the understanding of P dynamics in the cotton growing soils and \nthe response of applied P to cotton. \n4 Conclusions \nThere was a lint yield response to P applied before the oats cover crop. However, there was no legacy \neffect of applied P on cotton lint yield in the subsequent season . In order to better understand the \nresponse of cotton plants to applied P fertiliser, future research needs to quantify the movement of \napplied P to the slowly available BSES P pool in the soil. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was  undertaken as part of DAN1801 funded by Cotton Research and Development \nCorporation and the NSW Department of Primary Industries.

Recent research reported the yield benefits of maize rotation in a two -crop sequence. There \nwere only marginal yield benefits in a cotton -wheat-maize rotation (Hulugalle et al., 2020) , although \nwater infiltration was increased and reduced runoff (Nachimuthu et al., 2018). In addition, maize rotation \nis reported to improve the soil organic carbon (Osanai et al., 2020) but made it less resilient to structural \ndegradation (Hulugalle et al., 2020). The gross margin from cotton is four times higher than the gross \nmargin from maize (Nachimuthu et al., 2017) . Therefore, maize needs a legacy benefit to justify the \nforgoing of profits by growing it compared to continuous cotton. This field experiment was conducted \nto investigate the legacy benefits of maize rotation on cotton productivi ty and gross margins under \nconventional and minimum tillage systems. \n2 Methods \nThe experiment was conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute (ACRI) near Narrabri. \n(149047׳E, 30013׳S) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The soil is a deep uniform self -mulching \ngrey clay (Isbell RF, 2021) and is classified as a fine, thermic, smectitic, Typic Haplustert (Soil Survey \nStaff, 2010) . The mean annual rainfall for the region between 1993 and 2020 was 618 mm \n(Longpaddock, 2020) and the area has a semi-arid climate and experiences four distinct seasons with a \nmild winter and a hot summer. The soil in the experimental field is alkaline (average pH in 0.01 M CaCl2 \nis 7.4 in the 0 –0.3m depth) and non-saline (average electrical conductivity (EC1:5) is 0.11 dS/m in the \n0–0.3 m depth). The exchangeable cation concentrations are 17, 8.8, 1.13 and 0.56 cmol (+)/kg of \ncalcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium respectively, and the exchangeable sodium percentage \n(ESP) is 2.2 at 0–0.3m. Particle size distribution in the 0–0.3m depth is 53 g 100-1 g clay (<2 μm), 21 g \n100-1 g silt (2–20 μm) and 26 g/100 g sand (20 μm–2 mm). \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n93 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nThis experiment was initiated in 1985 with three cropping systems; viz. cotton monoculture sown after \neither maximum or minimum tillage, and a minimum -tilled cotton -wheat rotation (Constable et al., \n1992). Maximum tillage consists of slashing of cotton plants after harvest, followed by disc-ploughing \nand incorporation of cotton stalks to 0.2 m, chisel ploughing to 0.3m followed by 1-m bed construction \nand minimum tillage, slashing of cotton plants after harvest, followed by root cutting, incorporation of \ncotton stalks into beds, and bed renovation with a disc-hiller. Conventional cotton was sown until 1999, \n“Round-up Ready” cotton from 2000 to 2006, and “Bollgard -Roundup Ready Flex®” varieties \nthereafter. In 2014–15, “Bollgard-Liberty Link®” ( Variety-Sicot 70 BL) was planted @ 18 kg/ha. The \nfield has a slope of 0.1% from the head end to the tail end. The experiment was re-designed in 2011 to \ninclude maize. All the historical plots were considered as main plots and were split by either sowing a \nmaize ( Zea mays L.) crop during the summer following the previous year’s cotton or retaini ng the \nhistorical cropping system as a control. In the cotton-wheat system, maize was sown immediately after \nwheat.  \nThe six treatments from 2011 included:  \n(1) maximum tillage cotton monoculture (MXT-CC),  \n(2) maximum tillage maize cotton (MXT-MC),  \n(3) minimum tillage cotton monoculture (MNT-CC),  \n(4) minimum tillage maize cotton (MNT-MC),  \n(5) minimum tillage cotton-wheat (MNT-CW) and  \n(6) minimum tillage cotton-wheat-maize (MNT-CWM).  \nThe experimental design was a split -plot design where the historical tillage/rotation system \ncombinations were designated as main plot treatments and +/- maize as sub-plots, replicated four times. \nThe last maize crop was planted in the 2017–18 season and from the 2018–19 season, the three historical \ncropping systems were continued. However, the legacy effect of maize rotation is still being monitored \nand the data is presented for all six treatments. \nThe chronology of the experimental treatments from 2014 to 2017 was summarised  in Table 1 of \nNachimuthu et al. (2017) . The chronology of the experimental treatments from 2017 to 2022 is \nsummarised in Table 7.1 below. \nTable 7.1 A comparative summary of treatment characteristics to evaluate the efficacy of sowing \nmaize in rotation with cotton on cotton yield LTE at ACRI field C1* \n Treatment MXT-CC MXT-MC MNT-CC MNT-MC MNT-CW MNT-CWM \nHistorical \nrotation (1985- \n2011) \nCotton \nmonoculture \nCotton \nmonoculture \nCotton \nmonoculture \nCotton \nmonoculture \nCotton-Wheat \n(two year \ncycle) \nCotton-Wheat \n(two year \ncycle) \nTillage Maximum \n(both beds \nand furrows) \nMaximum \n(both beds and \nfurrows) \nMinimum \n(restricted to \nbeds top 10 cm) \nMinimum \n(restricted to \nbeds top 10 cm) \nMinimum \n(restricted to \nbeds top 10 \ncm) \nMinimum \n(restricted to \nbeds top 10 \ncm) \nCrops planted in \nJune 2017 \nFallow Fallow Fallow Fallow Wheat Wheat \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied  \n- - - - 80 kg N/ha 80 kg N/ha \nWinter crop \nharvest \n    Oct 2017 Oct 2017 \nCrops planted in \nOct/Dec 2017 \nCotton Maize Cotton Maize Wheat fallow Maize \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n94 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied \n260 kg N/ha 250 kg N/ha 260 kg N/ha 250 kg N/ha - 250 kg N/ha \nHarvest April 2018 April 2018 April 2018 April 2018  April 2018 \nTillage August 2018 August 2018 August 2018 August 2018  August 2018 \nCrops planted  in \nNov 2018 \nCotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied \n220 kg N/ha 220 kg N/ha 220 kg N/ha 220 kg N/ha 220 kg N/ha 220 kg N/ha \nHarvest May 2019 May 2019 May 2019 May 2019 May 2019 May 2019 \nStalk puller, \nTillage (25 cm) \nand laser levelling \n(top 5 cm) \nJune 2019 June 2019 June 2019 June 2019 June 2019 June 2019 \nCrop planted in \nJuly 2019 \nWheat Wheat Wheat Wheat Wheat Wheat \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied \n90 kg N/ha 90 kg N/ha 90 kg N/ha 90 kg N/ha 90 kg N/ha 90 kg N/ha \nHarvest Sprayed as \ncover crop \nSprayed as \ncover crop \nSprayed as cover \ncrop \nSprayed as cover \ncrop \nNov 2019 Nov 2019 \nCrops planted in \nOct 2019 \nCotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Wheat fallow Wheat fallow \nTotal fertiliser \napplied \n240 kg N/ha 240 kg N/ha 240 kg N/ha 240 kg N/ha - - \nHarvest May 2020 May 2020 May 2020 May 2020 - - \nTillage Aug 2020 Aug 2020 Aug 2020 Aug 2020 Aug 2020 Aug 2020 \nCrops planted  in \nNov 2020 \nCotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied \n180 kg N/ha 180 kg N/ha 180 kg N/ha 180 kg N/ha 180 kg N/ha 180 kg N/ha \nHarvest and \nmulching \nMay/June 2021 May/June 2021 May/June 2021 May/June 2021 May/June 2021 May/June 2021 \nTillage August 2021 August 2021 August 2021 August 2021 July 2021 July 2021 \nCrops planted in \nJuly 2021 \n- - - - Wheat Wheat \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied \n    60 kg N/ha 60 kg N/ha \nHarvest     Dec 2021 Dec 2021 \nCrops planted in \nOct 2021 \nCotton Cotton Cotton Cotton - - \nTotal N fertiliser \napplied \n280 kg N/ha 280 kg N/ha 280 kg N/ha 280 kg N/ha - - \nHarvest and \nmulching \nMay 2022 May 2022 May 2022 May 2022 - - \nTillage July 2022 July 2022 July 2022 July 2022 - - \n*This trial is a split-plot design with four replicates. \n \nCotton variety Sicot 746 B3F® was planted every summer in the respective treatments @ 15 kg/ha from \n2016–17 to 2019–20 and in 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, Sicot 748B3F® was planted in all the plots. \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n95 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nAll the crops in the rotation system were irrigated by furrow irrigation systems with siphons @ 1ML/ha \n(~100 mm) if the rainfall was insufficient to meet the evapotranspiration demand. Cotton was picked \nfrom late April to late June with a 4-row picker after defoliation in April/May. After cotton picking, the \ncotton was slashed and incorporated into the beds with a disc -hiller. Post-harvest operations or tillage \nwere done as described earlier for minimum and maximum tillage. Herbicide was applied, if required, \nafter assessing the weed popula tion. Chipping of cotton volunteers occurred as required. Defoliation \noccurred from late March to early April every year when at least 60% of bolls had opened, and picking \noccurred during April/May/June with a mechanical four -row cotton picker. Between lat e March and \nearly April, plant biomass samples were taken from 2 m 2 per plot by taking whole shoot samples and \nbolls samples. Samples were dried at 60 o C until constant weight and the final dry biomass recorded. \nDisease incidence was recorded in the 2021 –22 season by counting the number of plants infected per \nsquare metre and reported as a percentage of total plants sampled. The final yield was estimated by \nharvesting the economic produce (cotton or wheat) in the middle 4 to 8 rows of each plot using a \nmechanical harvester and yield was reported on a tonnes per hectare basis. A sub-sample of cotton was \nginned to calculate the lint and seed turnout. In 2021 and 2022, a hand harvest of 3 m 2 per plot was \nperformed due to electronic faults with the picker scale.  \nWheat (cv. Mustang or spitfire) was planted on raised beds during the 2017, 2019 and 2021 winters \n(June/July). Urea was applied to wheat as described in Table 7.1. The wheat was irrigated (100 mm per \nirrigation) when rainfall was insufficient to meet eva porative demand but was moderately stressed \nduring the 2015 spring due to a shortfall in available water for irrigation . After the mechanical wheat \nharvest, maize was planted into standing wheat stubble. The control treatment was left fallow from \nharvest until October of the following year when cotton was planted.  \nMaize was planted @ 8 seeds m-2 or 20 kg ha-1 on raised beds during Dec 2017. Maize received fertiliser \nN at a rate of 250 kg N/ha as urea (surface applied prior to incrop irrigation in December 2017). Maize \nwas irrigated at an average rate of 100 mm per irrigation with application frequency subject to rainfall \nand soil water content. It was harvested mechanically and then slashed to a height of 0.1 m. This was \nfollowed by a tractor-driven root cutter that cut the root system ~50 mm below the surface of the bed. \nMaize residues had partially decomposed by the time of cotton sowing, which occurred with no further \ntillage. \nVisual soil assessment (Shepherd et al., 2008) was undertaken in every plot. The top 20 cm of soil were \nscored for soil texture, structure, colour, mottles, earthworms, rooting depth, surface ponding, crusting \nand surface cover, and soil erosion index using the method described in Shepherd, Stagnari et al. (2008). \nEach indicator was given a visual score of zero (poor), 1 (moderate) and 2 (good) based on the soil \nquality observed comparing the field guide manual. We also scored 0.5, and 1.5 if the indicators fell \nbetween two cate gories. Each score was then multiplied by a weighting factor according to the \nimportance of that particular soil indicator. The soil quality index is an aggregated sum of the weighted \nindicators. Soil samples with a quality index of < 15 were classified as  poor, 15–30 were classified as \nmoderate and those with >30 were classified as good. \nSoil samples (0-1.20 m at increments of 0.0-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.45, 0.45-0.60, 0.60-0.90, 0.90-1.20 \nm depth) were taken from all plots during September/October of each planting season and analysed for \nSOC using the Walkley and Black method (Rayment and Lyons, 2011). The results were presented for \nthe 2018 and 2020 sampling in this report. A comparison of SOC measurement using the Walkley Black \nmethod and Mid-Infra-Red (MIR) technique (Hutengs et al., 2019) was undertaken for the topsoil (0-10 \ncm) samples in 2019. Samples were air -dried, ground and passed through a 0.2 mm sieve before \nscanning with MIR measurements. A subset of soil samples (0-10 cm) were transported with cool bricks \nto Adelaide before drying and were processed and analysed for microbial catabolic diversity (Gupta et \nal., 2019). \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n96 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nSoil pH (Soil: CaCl2 =1:5) was measured monthly to look into changes in soil pH after flooding in late \nNovember early December 2021 in all the plots. Samples were taken in each plot (0-30 cm), composited, \nair dried and passed through 2 mm sieve before soil pH measurements. \nIrrigation water and runoff water samples were collected during every irrigation and analysed for total \norganic carbon as described in Nachimuthu et al (2018). The total organic carbon loads were estimated \nusing the irrigation water volume and runoff volume presented in Nachimuthu et al (2018). Irrigation -\ninduced net carbon balance in terrestrial hydrological pathways was estimated. \nAll the statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance in Genstat 18.2 (VSN International \nLtd), using a split-plot design with the historical cropping system as main plots and maize rotation as \nsubplots. \n3 Results and discussion \nCotton lint yield and total drymat ter results are summarised in Table 7.2 and Table 7.3 respectively. \nLong-term historical cropping system influenced lint yield with the cotton -wheat system under \nminimum tillage yielding higher than cotton monoculture systems in 2018-19 and 2020-21 (Table 7.2). \nThe long-term yield data from the cotton monoculture treatments showed that yields under minimum \ntillage were equal to or greater than those under maximum tillage (Figure 7.1). Minimum tillage requires \nless energy and therefore has a better environmental footprint. \nTable 7.2.

As land is not a limitation compared to water availability within a in Australian \nbroadacre farm, continuing the maize rotation is likely to result in a positive impact on cotton yield over \nlong term (Nachimuthu et al., 2017). The maize drymatter and yield within the three-crop (cotton-wheat-\nmaize) systems were significantly lower than in the two -crop (maize-cotton) systems (Table 7.4). The \nlower maize yield following wheat was due to, (i) wheat stubble interfering with planting and resulting \nin a lower maize population, and (ii) immobilisation of soil and fertiliser N during the wheat stubble \nbreakdown, resulting in less N for maize growth. Over four maize rotation cycles and three cotton \ncropping systems we can conclude that maize rotation is suitable as a two -crop rotation with cotton. \nHowever, the benefits from maize in a three -crop rotation over two years (cotton -wheat-maize) were \nnegligible in terms of cotton productivity. The economic analysis also suggested the cotton -wheat \nrotation will result in a higher gross margin/ML of water (Nachimuthu et al., 2017). However, if water \nis not a limitation, the cotton monoculture system will result in a higher gross margin over the longer \nterm. \nTable 7.3.

Cotton plant recovery after flooding (minimum tillage plots on left, maximum tillage on right). \nThe resilience of soil under minimum tillage practice was apparent with plant recovery after a major \nflood in 2021 as a visual indicator. The cotton plants were four weeks old when the flooding occurred \nin late November/early December 2021. The plants under minimum tillage recovered faster than those \nunder minimum tillage. The main reason for the recovery was the difference in bed heights (Plate 7.1). \nThe minimum tilled plots had higher beds than maximum tilled plots where the soil got washed away \nduring the flood. Higher beds allowed the soil to aerate sooner after being inundated with length of time \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n99 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nof inundation a key determinant of plant productivity (Hodgson, 1982).

The results (Figure 7.2) show a trend for lower \ndisease incidence in the maize cotton system than in the cotton monoculture. There was no influence of \ntillage on disease and there was no interactio n between tillage and maize rotation. This suggests that \nmaize could be effective break crop to reduce the disease pressure, even after several seasons after the \nmaize crop. The weed population measured in the 2019 -20 season indicated maximum tillage systems \nrecorded a higher weed population (22.5 weeds/m2) than minimum tillage systems (2.3 weeds/m2). This \ncould be a result of cotton plants in the minimum tillage system providing a better smothering effect \nthan the maximum tillage system as cotton biomass was higher under minimum tillage (Table 7.3). \nHowever, roundup-ready volunteers were higher under minimum tillage system and it could provide a \nchallenge for sustainable soil management similar to resistant weeds under dryland no -till cropping \nsystems. \n \n \nFigure 7.2.

Rotations including maize \nhad a negative effect on wheat yield during 2015 (Nachimuthu et al., 2017)  and 2017 (Figure 7.3). \nHowever, there was no legacy effect of maize on wheat grown in 2019 or 2021 (Figure 7.3). These \nresults highlight that the ‘system productivity’ of a three-crop rotation will be lower due to lower wheat \nand maize yields (Table 7.4 and Figure 7.3). \n \n \nFigure 7.3. Wheat yield in field C1 from 2017 to 2021 as influenced by maize rotation \n \nSoil organic carbon (SOC) declined in all sampled depths from 2018 to 2020 (Table 7.5). This is likely \na result of the reduced input of plant matter during the severe drought. The inclusion of maize in the \ncrop rotation improved the concentration of SOC in the topsoil (Figure 7.5), but this effect had dissipated \nby the 2020 sampling. Monitoring of SOC will be continued in DAN2305. The long -term SOC stocks \ncalculated using the equivalent soil mass method will be presented in DAN2305. \nA comparison of SOC measurement using the Walkley Black method and Mid -Infra-Red (MIR) \ntechnique for the topsoil (10 cm) samples showed no correlation between the two methods, making MIR \nunsuitable for SOC determination on this soil type. Improved, cheaper and more reliable methods are \nrequired for growers to undertake regular soil carbon measurements. \nThe microbial catabolic diversity in the 2019 -20 season indicates the legacy effect of maize rotations. \nThe effect of residual Maize seems to vary with different tillage treatments (Figure 7.4). For example, \nthe effect of maize in the rotation on catabolic composition was greater with maximum tillage treatment \ncompared with that in the minimum tillage treatments. In general, microbial activity and catabolic \nmeasures (i.e. community metabolic diversity, CMD and average metabolic response, AMR) were \nhigher in the maximum tillag e treatments compared to that in soils from minimum tillage treatments. \nFor example, CMD was significantly (P<0.017) higher in the maximum tillage treatment (ave. \n18.1±0.80) compared to minimum tillage cotton monoculture treatment (ave. 14.8±0.87). The gen eral \nobservation of higher microbial activity and catabolic potential measures (CMD and AMR) suggest \ngreater microbial C turnover contributing to lower SOC, especially in view of the reduced plant C inputs. \nAdditionally, the varying levels of legacy effect of maize in the different cropping systems indicate that \nmicrobial C turnover processes as influenced by disturbance (tillage) and crops grown can have \nsignificant effects on overall SOC status in cotton soils. \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n101 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 7.5.

Soil organic carbon concentrations at various depths as influenced by maize rotation at ACRI \nfield C1  \nThe soil quality index (visual soil assessment (VSA)) was above 30 (good) for all plots: no treatment \ndifferences. All treatments adopted cotton stubble incorporation into the topsoil which improves the soil \nquality compared to past raking and burning practices. Crop rotation using cereals and legumes within \ncotton-based cropping systems is often postulated as a potential means to improve the soil prope rties \nthat can enhance soil physical properties (Hulugalle and Scott, 2008)  and fertility (Rochester, 2011; \nRochester et al., 2001). While the soil quality index was rated as ‘good’ using the visual soil assessment \nmethod, there are still opportunities for improvement using the soil management practices. In particular, \nmanagement options t hat will minimise compaction and improve soil fertility will enhance the \nopportunity for achieving nearer to the theoretical yield potential of 22 bales/ha if other production \nfactors are not limiting. \nOne of the drawbacks of visual soil assessment is the biological indicator. Earthworms are the only \nbiological indicator assessed in this method and they were not sighted in any of the treatments within \nthis long -term trial and could be due to flood irrigation water logging the soil every 10 -14 days. \nHowever, we noticed management-induced differences in cotton fabric degradation (Nachimuthu et al., \n2022) and suggest that this may be a more appropriate biological quality indicator that is representative \nof soil organic matter degradation under cotton -growing conditions. The VSA (soil quality index or \nother individual scores for soil structure or porosity) was not correlated with crop performance (yield). \nSo, further refinement is required to develop the relationship between soil quality index and cotton lint \nyield in Vertosols. \nSoil pH decreased in all treatment plots following flooding in early December. Thes e soils are slightly \nalkaline (Hulugalle et al., 2020). Previous reports are suggesting the soil pH of alkaline soils will move \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n103 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \ntowards neutral due to entrapped carbon dioxide in the soil during the flood and slowly return to inherent \nsoil pH after that (Ponnamperuma, 1972).  \nTable 7.6.

The carbon gains through irrigation water ranged from 14 to \n288 kg C/ha and the carbon losses through irrigation wa ter ranged from 7.3 to 104 kg C/ha. Overall, \nthere were net gains (6.6 to 184 kg C/ha) to the cotton field through terrestrial hydrological pathways \nacross four years so carbon movement in irrigation water did not contribute to the SOC decline in this \nfield (Figure 7.5). The carbon loads in 2017-18 were much higher than in any other year. The difference \nin carbon loads, pH and electrical conductivity between years in the irrigation water is a combined result \nof the river, bore water qualities and recirculat ion of tail drain water from other fields. EC is higher in \nrunoff water than in irrigation water and is expected as a result of the leaching of salt from the field \nduring irrigation. Phosphorus movement within irrigation network was reported in More Profit  from \nNitrogen project. \nThe average seasonal soil water storage, measured a day before each irrigation, showed that the cotton \nmonoculture system under minimum tillage stored less water than maximum tillage (Figure 7.6) \nsuggesting the crop utilised the soi l moisture more effectively to produce economic yield under \nminimum tillage (Table 7.2). There was also a maize effect in the 2019-20 season with more stored soil \nwater under the maize-cotton system than cotton monoculture systems. However, the maize effect was \nabsent in 2021-22 which suggests the legacy effect was short-lived for soil water storage. \n  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n104 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 7.7.

The cotton-wheat system had higher soil water storage than cotton monoculture under minimum \ntillage and the cotton-wheat system also recorded higher lint yield (Table 7.2). This suggests the cotton-\nwheat system will be more resilient to drought as it got higher soil water storage under similar soil \nmanagement practices. However, in spite of recording higher soil water storage, the yields were lower \nunder the maximum tillage cotton monoculture system, and there may be other constraints such as \ndisease (Figure 7.2) or poor soil health limiting its water use efficiency. \n \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n105 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 7.8.

Maize is a good break crop for managing Verticillium disease. Minimum \ntillage systems were more resilient to flood impact. The water use efficiency of the minimum tilled \ncotton wheat system is higher than cotton monoculture system. Future research needs to focus on \nadditional rotation crops that can alleviate soil compaction, increase soil organic carbon and benefit the \nproductivity of the cotton crop. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was undertaken as part of DAN1801 funded by Cotton Research and Development \nCorporation and the NSW Department  of Primary Industries.

Trials grown in C1 are a continuation of the tillage comparisons for two cotton farming \nsystems, continuous cotton and cotton -wheat.  In the 2011 -12 season, these trials were extended to \ninclude maize. \nIn the extended trial, each of the three historical trials (yellow boxes in Figure 8.1), include two subplots \nthat include the historical treatment (a) and a treatment that includes maize every second summer (b). \n        \n  CC   a.

A gross margin is the gross income from an \nenterprise less the variable costs incurred in achieving it. Variable costs are those costs directly \nattributable to an enterprise and which vary in proportion to the size of an enterprise. For example, if \nthe area of cotton sown doubles, then the variable costs associated with growing it, such as seed, \nchemicals, and fertilisers, will also roughly double. \nThe gross margins reported here are not the same as gross profit, because they do not include overhead \ncosts such as depreciation, interest payments, rates, or permanent labour which have to be met \nregardless of enterprise size. While simple gross margin analyses are useful at the enterprise scale, \ninvariably a more thorough analysis at the whole farm scale is required to assess financial impacts of \ndifferent cropping rotations over a longer period. \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n108 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nThis analysis will consider the  recent seasonal gross margins for 2017 through to the 2018 -19 cotton \nseason. \nGross margin (GM) results were calculated using a long-term average cotton lint price of $450 per bale, \ncotton seed price of $170 per tonne, and a revised wheat price of $275 per tonne for APH2 grade, maize \nprice of $200 per tonne (ex farm) and estimated costs for the actual operations conducted on each \ntreatment, including fallow costs. Prices are kept the same across years to avoid confounding the \ntreatment results with commodit y price variability. Results are presented on both a gross margin per \nhectare (GM/ha) and per megalitre (GM/ML) basis. \nGross margin for one hectare of cotton also considers the associated refuge crop. In the 2017 -18 and \n2018-19 seasons at ACRI, Bollgard® 3 varieties were planted with unsprayed conventional cotton grown \nas the refuge. For every hectare of Bollgard® 3 cotton grown, there was 0.05 hectare of unsprayed cotton \nfor refuge. Therefore, in the gross margin comparison, one hectare of cotton is 0.95 B ollgard® 3 and \n0.05 unsprayed conventional cotton. The yields shown are the full yield/ha for the Bollgard ® 3 cotton, \nbut the income, costs and gross margins reported are all 95% Bollgard ® 3 and 5% refuge crop when \ncotton is grown. \n2 2017 Season Results \nIn the 2017 winter cropping season both of the cotton/wheat rotations had wheat, Cotton-Wheat-fallow-\nfallow (C.W.min) and Cotton -Wheat-Maize-fallow (C.W.M.min). The rest of the treatments were \nfallow. Wheat yield in the maize rotation (C.W.M.min) was higher at  3.71 t/ha, compared to 3.32 t/ha \nin the cotton/wheat rotation (C.W.min, Table 8.1). The wheat grade achieved in both treatments was \nAPH2, with low screenings of 1.8%. \nTable 8.1: 2017 Season Results \n \nC.C.reg C.M.reg C.C.min C.M.min C.W.min C.W.M.min \nCrop  fallow   fallow   fallow   fallow  wheat  wheat \nWheat t/ha     3.32 3.71 \nIncome $/ha N/A N/A N/A N/A 913  1,020  \nVariable Costs $/ha 52 63 43 63 331 331 \nGM $/ha (52) (63) (43) (63) 582 690 \nGM $/ML N/A N/A N/A N/A 291 345 \n3 2017-18 Season Results \nDuring the 2017 -18 summer season, the cotton returned the highest yield under the regular tillage \ntreatment compared to minimum tillage. Maize retuned the highest yield under the C.M.min treatment \n(7.06 t/ha), but the lowest under th e C.W.M.min treatment (5.4 t/ha). Maize used a similar amount of \nwater to cotton, but had a lower gross margin per hectare, so the GM $/ML was lower for maize. \n  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n109 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 8.2: 2017-18 Season Results \n \nC.C.reg C.M.reg C.C.min C.M.min C.W.min C.W.M.min \nCrop cotton maize cotton maize fallow maize \nCotton Lint Yield 9.8  8.9    \nCotton Seed or \ngrain yield \n2.13 6.62 2.01 7.06  5.4 \nML applied/ha 7.8 7.0 7.8 7.0  7.0 \nIncome $/ha 4,533 1,324 4,129 1,556  1,080 \nVariable Costs $/ha 2,466 844 2,380 844 12 473 \nGM $/ha 2,067 480 1,749 712 (12) 607 \nGM $/ML 265 69 224 102  87 \n \n4 Full year results: 2017 and 2017-18 seasons \nThe results show that the continuous cotton treatments returned the highest GM/ha with the C.C.reg \ntreatment returning the highest GM/ha (Table 8.3). \n \nFigure 8.2: Gross margin/ha and per ML, 2017-18 \nThe C.W.M.min treatment used the most water per hectare since it grew 2 crops during the year, \nwheat 2 ML/ha and maize, 7 ML/ha (Table 8.3). \n  \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n110 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 8.3: Full Year Results 2017 and 2017-18 \nSummary C.C.reg C.M.reg C.C.min C.M.min C.W.min C.W.M.min \nCrop Sequence  fallow/cotton fallow/maize fallow/cotton fallow/maize wheat/fallow wheat/maize \nML applied/ha 7.80 7.00 7.80 7.00 2.00 9.00 \nIncome $/ha 4,533 1,324 4,129 1,556 913 2,100 \nVariable Costs \n$/ha \n2,519 908 2,424 908 342 804 \nGM $/ha 2,015 416 1,706 648 570 1,296 \nGM $/ML 258 59 219 93 285 144 \n \n5 2018 Season Results \nIn the 2018 winter cropping season, all of the treatments were in fallow.

The minimum till treatments did not require a herbicide. \n6 Full year results: 2018 and 2018-19 seasons \nIn 2018-19, all treatments were under Bollgard 3® cotton, with an unsprayed conventional cotton refuge \n(5% of area).

However, these soils can become \nwaterlogged during wetter -than-usual years, particularly after high intensity rainfall events. Under \nprolonged waterlogged conditions, various soil properties can change, such as soil pH and redox. When \na soil is waterlogged, cotton roots are deprived of oxygen and the plant’s growth will be affected. Under \nthese circumstances, crop nutrition may be temporarily impacted as nutrient and micronutrient \navailability is related to soil properties (Palmer et al., 2023) . Foliar application of nutrients is often \npromoted to assist cotton crops to recover quickly from the impact of floods and prolonged waterlogging \nconditions.  \nDuring the 2021 –22 cotton-growing s eason, an experiment was conducted at the Australian Cotton \nResearch Institute to investigate the efficacy of various foliar nutrient treatments on cotton biomass and \nyield in a field impacted by flooding. \n2 Methods \nLocation \nField C1, Australian Cotton Research Institute, Narrabri (-30.20oS, 149.60oE) \nCrop Management \nDetails of the cotton variety and crop operations dates are presented in Table 9.1 below.  \nTable 9.1.

The irrigation rate was ~ 100 mm/irrigation with application \nfrequency being subject to rainfall and soil water content. Herbicide was applied as required. \nHandpicking was done to estimate the yield and this was followed by a mechanical harvester. The \ncotton plants were then slashed to a height of 0.1 m. This was followed by a tractor-driven root cutter \nthat cut the root system ~50 mm below the surface of the bed. \nSoil characteristics \nSelf-mulching cracking clay (Vertosol). The baseline soil properties of field C1 are presented in \nNachimuthu et al. (2017). \nRainfall and Irrigation \nThe site received 467 mm of rainfall between the planting and first defoliation of cotton during the \n2021–22 season. The rainfall events in November (208 mm monthly total with 106 mm in the last 10 \ndays of November) resulted in riverine flooding which peaked at the Glencoe channel measurement \nstation (nearby ACRI) on 30 November 2021, causing flooding of this field from the Namoi River \noverflow. The field was flooded for 3–4 days and the section of this field was flooded for 4 days with \nsubsequent subsoil deep drainage slower than usual due to the saturated soil profile. \nFertiliser \nN fertiliser was applied @ 180 kg N/ha as urea before planting, with another 100 kg N/ha applied in \nDecember as a top-up application to supplement the loss of soil and basal fertiliser N via leaching and \ndenitrification. The foliar nutrient treatments were applied on 20 Dec 2021. This date was the earliest \nthe field could be accessed due to follow up rainfall. \nWeed and insect management \nWeed management practices were conducted as per GM cotton agronomic practice requirements.  \nBiomass measurements and disease incidence \nAt the boll opening stage, all plants in one meter of plant row (within each treatment plot) were cut at \nthe soil surface and bagged in the field. The wet weight of the entire 1 m cut was recorded and a \nsubsample of three plants was used for assessing the weight, total nodes per plant, and plant height. \nThese subsamples were separated for vegetative biomass (stems and leaves) and bolls and dried at 70oC \nin a fan-forced dehydrator. The dried samples were weighed for dry biomass assessment.  \nNormalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) images and groundcover were recorded periodically \nover a month after application within each treatment plot using hand -held Greenseeker TM and \nphotograph respectively. NDVI detects chlorophyll density and so can indicate whether the foliar \ntreatments led to differences in plant biomass and plant nutrition. Ground cover percentage was \ncalculated as GC%= % area covered by gr een matter in the area photographed. A uniform height was \nadopted above the plant to photograph each time. \nVerticillium wilt is an invasive disease at ACRI. The disease incidence within each treatment plot was \nreported as a percentage of plants observed to be infected in the harvested one linear square meter. \nHarvest, ginning and lint yield estimation  \nThe final harvest occurred on 26 May 2022. Seed cotton was hand-picked and weighed immediately. \nA <500 g seed cotton subsample was ginned using a CSIRO custom build saw gin to determine the gin \nturnout (i.e., the percentage mass of seed and lint). The lint turnout (% lint) was used to estimate the \nlint yield from seed cotton and the results were reported as bales lint/ha. \nTreatments \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n115 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nThe experiment was a randomised block design with five treatments, each replicated four times. The \nfoliar spray treatments included, \nT1 - Control (distilled water) \nT2 - N42 (urea ammonium nitrate: 42% nitrogen in product) 0.42% v/v in water (Yarra Pvt Ltd) \nT3 – REDOX MAP (mono ammonium phosphate: 12% nitrogen, 26% phosphorus and 0-1% zinc in \nproduct) 1.3% v/v in water \nT4 – Sigma Aldrich Zn (zinc sulfate heptahydrate) 0.38% w/v in water \nT5 – ‘CGS Shotgun’ (Cotton Grower Services: nutrient analysis in Table 9.2 below) \nAll plots received 50 L/ha of spray volume of tank mix with concentrations described above. \nTable 9.2- Nutrient analysis of foliar product CGS Shotgun* \nNutrient Typical Analysis % (W/V) \nTotal Nitrogen (N) \nTotal Phosphorus (P)  \nTotal Potassium (K)  \nTotal Sulphur (S)  \nTotal Manganese (Mn)  \nTotal Zinc (Zn)  \nTotal Copper (Cu)  \nTotal Iron (Fe)  \nTotal Boron (B)  \nTotal Molybdenum (Mo)  \nTotal Magnesium (Mg)  \nTotal Cobalt (Co)  \n4.8 \n10.4 \n2.5 \n2.6 \n2.3 \n3.8 \n0.27 \n0.3 \n0.28 \n0.16 \n1.6 \n0.02 \n*- 5 L of this product was mixed with 50 L of water for field application \nStatistical analysis \nAll the data analysis was carried out using Genstat (21st Edition, VSN International Ltd). The response \nfactor (lint yield, dry biomass, fibre quality etc.) was analysed using Analysis of Variance. The \ntreatment effects with a probability of <5% were considered as significant effects. In such cases, the \nleast significant difference (P < 0.05) was used to compare treatment means. \n3 Results and discussion \nThe results (Tables 9.3–9.5) showed no significant treatment effects of foliar -applied nutrients on lint \nyield, fibre quality or any other measured plant growth parameters (dry matter, plant height, NDVI, \ngroundcover and disease incidence). This study investigated whethe r foliar application of selected \nnutrients applied after waterlogging, either alone, or in combination with other nutrients, was able to \nimprove growth and yield. The NDVI results suggested that neither groundcover (%) nor plant health \nwere improved by foliar-applied nutrients when compared to control plots (Table 9.3). Previous studies \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n116 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nreported potential benefits to crop performance when nutrients were applied prior to waterlogging \n(Hodgson and MacLeod, 1988; NUTRIpak, 2018).  \nThe average plant height, mainstem node number and disease incidence—all measured during the boll \nopening stage—also showed no impact of foliar nutrient treatments (Table 9.4). Likewise, vegetative \ndry matter, boll dry matter, total plant dry matter, lint yield (Table 9.4) and fibre quality (Table 9.5) \nwere also not impacted by the foliar-applied nutrient treatments.  \nThe crop received 180 kg N/ha as a basal pre -plant N application, most of which either leached or \ndenitrified during the flooding event and was thus lost from the soil r oot zone. However, the top -up \nfertiliser application of 100 kg N/ha likely prevented crop N deficiency. The soil Colwell P levels were \nabove 60 mg/kg for this field and P response at these levels was unlikely in Vertosols with high BSES \nP reserves, as in this case.  \nMicronutrient availability in soil is likely impacted by flooding. However, the lack of response for foliar \nnutrition suggests that the plants were unable to recover until after the flood water receded when the \ntemporary unavailability of soil nutrients was reversed. Therefore, a foliar application of plant nutrients \nis unlikely to improve plant growth after flooding in this heavy cracking clay soil with high pH and \nnative fertility. Errington et al. (2007) also reported a lack of cotton response to foliar P and K in the \nVertosols. The long-term experiment within the same field suggested that the minimum tilled plots \nresulted in more intact beds (higher bed height) during the flood and better plant recovery compared to \nconventionally tilled plots. This together informs that better soil c onditions will improve plant growth \nand yield in these soils with relatively high nutrient reserves compared to foliar-applied nutrients. \nTable 9.3.

However, the cotton crop was resilient and recovered after the \ndamage resulting in a yield greater than 10 bales/ha on average. The cotton harvest in 2018-19 season \nresulted in higher than long-term average yield in a cotton monoculture system. The additional yield in \nthat season was the cumulative effect of extended season and additional branching resulting in more \nbolls. The additional branching might have resulted in a better light interception and potentially \ncontributed towards improvement in yield. However, the weather pattern may not allow extended season \nin all years and could result in yield penalty. To test the effect of this hail damage, two hail simulation \ntrials were conducted in the 2019-20 season within the long-term trials by removing the tips of the cotton \nplants on the same date as the previous year of hail damage. Two experiments were carried out during \n2019-20 and a single experiment was carried out during the 2020-21 season to investigate the effect of \nhailstorm damage on cotton lint yield. Our aim was to test if hail damage simulated crop are resulting \nin similar yield as that of control crops. \n2 Methods \nLocation and crop management \nThe experiment was conducted at the Field C1 and D1, Australian Cotton Research Institute, Narrabri \n(-30.20, 149.60).

Defoliation occurred on dates as per Table 10.1. \nHandpicking was done to estimate the yield and this was followed by a mechanical harvester to \nharvest the bulk crop. The cotton plants were then slashed to a height of 0.1 m. This was followed by a \ntractor-driven root cutter that cut the root system ~50 mm below the surface of the bed and pupae \nbusting (top 10 cm). \nSoil characteristics \nSelf-mulching cracking clay (Vertosol). The baseline characteristics of fields C1 and D1 are presented \nin Nachimuthu et al. (2017) \nRainfall and Irrigation \nThe site received 358 mm and 436 mm of rainfall between the planting and harvest of cotton during \nthe 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons respectively. \nFertiliser \nN fertiliser was applied @ 240 kg N/ha as urea in 2019-20 for both the fields and 180 kg N/ha as urea \nin the 2020-21 season in field D1.  \nWeed and insect management \nWeed management practices were conducted as per GM cotton agronomic practice requirements.  \nHarvest, ginning and lint yield estimation  \nThe final harvest occurred as described in Table 10.1 for each experiment. Seed cotton was harvested \nhandpicked and weighed immediately. A <500 g seed cotton subsample was ginned using a 20-saw \ngin with a pre-cleaner (Continental Eagle, Prattville, AL, USA) to determine the gin turnout (i.e., the \npercentages of seed and lint by mass). The lint turnout (% lint) was used to estimate the lint yield from \nseed cotton and the results were reported as bales lint/ha. \nTreatments \nThe experiments in C1 used a randomised block design, with hail damage and control as the \ntreatments. All treatments were replicated four times in both the 2019-20 and 2020-21seasons. \nIn Field D1, a factorial design was used with crop rotation as main plots and hail damage and control \nas subplots in the 2019-20 season. (Note: crop rotation results are presented in Chapter 4). Four \nreplicates were used in this experiment as well.  \nThe simulated hail damage treatments were applied by cutting the plant tips using either secateurs \n(2019–20) or a mechanical slasher (2020–21). \nStatistical analysis \nAll data analysis was carried out using Genstat (21st Edition, VSN International Ltd). Lint yield was \nanalysed using Analysis of variance to assess the effect of treatments in field C1 and the effect of crop \nrotation and treatment and their interactions in field D1. \n3 Results and discussion \nLint yield \nThe 2019–20 experiments showed no significant difference in lint yield between the hail damage and \ncontrol treatments (Table 10.2) in either field (C1 and D1). However, the lint yield in the cotton-wheat \nrotation was significantly higher than in the cotton monoculture (Data presented in the Chapter 4).  \n  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n121 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTable 10.2.

In this investigation we mainly focussed on if there was \nan yield penalty as a result of hail damage simulation and our results indicate there is no impact of hail \ndamage simulation on cotton lint yield. These results have implications on decision support for growers \nwho don’t obtain appropriate crop insurance.  \nTable 10.3.

The results suggest, if the growers don’t have appropriate crop \ninsurance, continuing the hail -damaged crop in December could result in average lint yield provided \nother factors are not limiting the cotton crop growth and maturity. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was undertaken as part of DAN1801 funded by Cotton Research and Development \nCorporation and the NSW Department of Primary Industries.

Little is known about changes in long-term \nmicronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) concentrations in these systems. This study investigated changes in soil \nmicronutrient concentrations over time in two long -term tillage and crop rotatio n experiments under \nfurrow-irrigated cotton systems and a no-till dryland cropping enterprise. The tillage practices that were \ninvestigated were maximum (disc to 0.2 m, chisel ploughing to 0.3 m followed by the construction of \nbeds in 1 m spacings) and minimum (mulching cotton residues, followed by root cutting, incorporation \nof cotton stalks and bed renovation with a disc -hiller) tillage. Soil samples were analysed for \ndiethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) extractable micronutrients, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) total \nmicronutrients, pH, and soil organic carbon (SOC). Both maximum and minimum tillage influenced \ntopsoil distribution of DTPA -extractable Cu, Zn and Mn, with the greatest changes occurring in Mn \nconcentration. Concentrations of Mn in the topsoil (0-0.15 m) during 2015 were higher than those in the \nsubsoil (0.15-0.6 m) by 74% with maximum tillage and 159% with minimum tillage, suggesting greater \nstratification with the latter (28 mg kg-1 in topsoil vs 11 mg kg-1 in subsoil). Including wheat (Triticum \naestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in cotton rotations increased DTPA-extractable Mn concentration. \nDTPA-extractable Mn was positively correlated with SOC in two experiments (P < 0.01) and DTPA Fe \nand pH were negatively correlated (P < 0.01). DTPA Zn concentrations under minimum -till cotton \nsystems were stable over 18 years. DTPA Zn concentrations measured at 0.02 m increments suggested \nthat soil below the fertiliser band depth (< 0.04 m) was potentially responsive to Zn application. \nSampling in sma ller depth increments in the topsoil (0.02 m increments in 0 -0.1 m depth) more \naccurately identified micronutrient stratification and may improve management decisions when sowing. \nOur results indicated that managing soil pH and SOC in alkaline Vertisols under irrigated cotton systems \nwas a more practical approach to address micronutrient availability than soil application of \nmicronutrients. Future research should consider the implications of current agronomic practices in \ncotton production, such as the method and timing of nitrogen application as it influences changes in soil \npH, which may impact micronutrient availability at critical crop growth stages.  \nKeywords \nTrace elements; Nutrient stratification; Soil constraints; Plant-available nutrients; Soil-profile \ndistribution; Soil carbon \n \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n123 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n1 Introduction \nSoil management practices, such as conservation tillage, that minimise tillage and improve physical \nproperties and soil carbon are alternatives to conventional soil management that uses aggressive tillage \n(ABS, 2018; Pretty and Bharucha, 2014). Additionally, crop rotations can improve the sustainability \nand productivity of cropping systems (Bowles et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2021). Crop rotation and tillage \ncan also improve soil physical properties (Hulugalle et al ., 2006; Somasundaram et al., 2018), \ninfiltration, soil water storage, crop water use efficiency (Basche and DeLonge, 2019) and soil biological \nproperties (Polain et al., 2020). Conservation tillage can, however, lead to nutrient stratification with \nhigher concentrations occurring in the surface horizons (Dang et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2007). This is \na significant constraint of conservation tillage. A key determinant of crop yield maximisation is the \noptimum spatial distribution and availability of nutrients throughout the soil volume such that roots can \nconcurrently access essential nutrients and water reserves at depth (Su et al., 2018).  \nThe widespread use of genetically modified (GM) technology (where cotton plants are embedded with \ngenetic material to exhibit herbicide tolerance and produce Bacillus thuringiensis toxins) (Fleming et \nal., 2018) in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), has implications for soil, nutrient and weed management. \nWhile herbicide-tolerant cotton increases the opportunity for minimi sing cultivation to achieve weed \ncontrol, the mandatory post -harvest cultivation to manage Helicoverpa spp. resistance requires some \nsoil disturbance at the end of each season. Additionally, cotton in Australia is surface mulched at the \nend of the season ( Hulugalle et al., 2013) compared to residue removal via stalk pulling or stubble \nburning in other parts of the world (Jalota et al., 2008; Ramanjaneyulu et al., 2021). So, there is a \nsignificant difference between conservation tillage under dryland cropping systems across the world and \nminimum tillage under cotton cropping systems in Australia. Strategic tillage has been suggested as an \nalternative for potential herbicide-resistant weed management and to redistribute the stratified nutrients \nunder dryland conditions (Wortmann and Dang, 2020). This is likely to occur to some extent in cotton \nsystems at the end of every season with standard agronomic management of GM cotton. However, the \ndepth of this soil disturbance varies across cotton industry fields rangi ng from 0.1 m to 0.3 m. This \nvarying degree of tillage along with other cropping system components such as rotation crops could \nalter the soil nutrient profile and availability over depths. Rotation crops within cropping systems can \nalter the nutrient dist ribution of the soil profile depending on their rooting depth and crop demand \n(Armstrong et al., 2019; Houx et al., 2011) beyond the tillage depth in the profile. \nIn Australia, cotton production occurs predominantly in relatively fertile Vertisols (Soil Su rvey Staff \n2014) with high clay content and high water -holding capacity (Vervoort et al., 2003). The intrinsic \nfertility of these Vertisols enabled historical crop production to occur with fewer fertiliser inputs, with \nmost nutrient management practices emphasising nitrogen (N) (Macdonald et al., 2018) while neglecting \nother nutrients. Most Australian cotton is grown in soils with high pH (Filippi et al., 2019), which may \nlimit the availability of some nutrients (Gentili et al., 2018). Soil N and its impact on crop growth have \nbeen studied extensively in Australia (Rochester, 2011, 2012; Rochester and Bange, 2016; Schwenke \nand McPherson, 2022; Weaver, 2022), with a more recent focus on phosphorus and potassium \n(Nachimuthu et al., 2022; Rochester, 2010). The research on micronutrients in Australian cotton has \nfocussed on plant uptake as soil available micronutrients were not considered limiting (Constable et al., \n1988). Earlier research that assessed micronutrient uptake in 35 cotton crops in Australia suggest ed \nsufficiency in Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn (Constable et al., 1988) and more recently reported an improvement \nin nutrient use efficiency with modern cultivars for Zn, Cu and Fe and no change for Mn (Rochester and \nConstable, 2015). The research on soil micronutrient status across Australian cotton farms is, however, \nsparse.  \nManagement errors such as over-fertilisation and over-irrigation may inhibit micronutrient availability. \nThe availability of Fe, Cu and Zn may be reduced by acidification caused by high rates of N fertiliser \napplication(Wright et al., 2007; Janke et al., 2022), which is of concern in Australia due to excessive N \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n124 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nfertiliser use by many cotton growers (Macdonald et al., 2018). Vertisols are often prone to waterlogging \ndue to their high clay concentration and low microporosity under wet conditions caused by ov er-\nirrigation or heavy rainfall (Hulme et al., 1991), which can impact the availability of nutrients such as \nFe and Mn (Wollmer et al., 2019).  \nEach micronutrient plays a vital role in the cotton plant's metabolic processes, therefore specific \nmicronutrients are required in varying quantities as determined by the plant's growth stage. For example, \n73% of Zn uptake in irrigated cotton occurs during the crop's peak flowering stage (Rochester et al., \n2012). Depending on soil conditions, rooting depth will dictate the nutrient extraction zone. Therefore, \nif the required micronutrient is not available to plants in an adequate amount in its nutrient extraction \nzone, crop development will be inhibited. In this way, nutrient stratification can lead to in-crop nutrient \ndeficiencies. As the micronutrient cations in this study (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) are mostly immobile in soil \n(Fageria et al., 2010), stratification is an important consideration for plant availability and growth. \nAs micronutrients are required in very small  quantities, assessing the long -term changes in total and \navailable micronutrients over various depth increments under contrasting management practices such as \nvarying tillage depth and crop rotation will unravel the current status of micronutrients and th eir \nstratification, if any, in Vertisols. This knowledge will improve decision -making for future nutrient \nmanagement strategies suited for cotton cropping systems. This study investigated the following \nhypotheses; 1) there is a decline in total and plant a vailable micronutrients across the soil profile over \nthe long term in cotton growing Vertisols, 2) micronutrient stratification pattern differed over years with \ntillage and crop rotation, 3) plant available micronutrients are related to changes in soil pH and SOC, \nand 4) tillage influences topsoil micronutrient stratification.  \nThese hypotheses were tested by analysing a combination of historical and recent soil samples from two \nlong-term tillage and crop rotation experiments and a commercial dryland site. This study is the first of \nits kind to investigate long -term changes in micronutrient concentrations in Australian cotton systems \nand will result in an improved understanding of the micronutrient status as influenced by tillage and \ncrop rotation practices. \n2 Materials and methods \n2.1 Site description  \nTwo long -term experiments (Field C1 and D1) located at the Australian Cotton Research Institute \n(ACRI), Narrabri (149°47′E, 30°13′S), Australia and two commercial fields (Field 3 and 4) near Edgeroi \n(149°79’E, 30°11’S), Australia were investigated in this research. Mean annual rainfall for the region \nbetween 1993 and 2020 was 618mm (Longpaddock, 2020) and the area has a semi -arid climate, BSh \n(Kottek et al., 2006), and experiences four distinct seasons with a mild winter and a hot summer. January \nis the hottest month with a maximum daily mean temperature of 34.3 °C and a minimum daily mean \ntemperature of 20°C and July is the coolest month, with a maximum daily mean temperature of 17.8°C \nand a minimum daily mean temperature of 4°C (BOM, 2020).  \n2.2 Field treatments  \n2.2.1 Field C1   \nThe soil was a deep, uniform grey clay and classified as a fine, thermic, smectitic, Typic Haplustert (Soil \nSurvey Staff 2014). At the 0-1 m depth it had a particle size distribut ion of 64 g 100 g -1 clay (<2 μm), \n11 g 100 g-1 silt (2–20 μm) and 25 g 100 g-1 sand (20 μm–2 mm), was alkaline (pH in 0.01 M CaCl2 was \n7.5) and non-saline (electrical conductivity (EC1:5) was 0.29 dS m-1). Exchangeable sodium percentage \n(ESP) was 3 at 0–0.6 m and 10 at 0.6–1.0 m. The experiment in field C1 had three treatments over four \nreplications implemented from 1985 which were (1) maximum tillage and continuous cotton \nmonoculture (summer cotton and winter fallow every year), (2) minimum tillage and continuous cotton \nmonoculture (summer cotton and winter fallow every year) and (3) minimum tillage and cotton -wheat \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n125 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n(Triticum aestivum  L.) rotation (summer cotton and winter wheat followed by summer and wint er \nfallow).  \nMaximum tillage consisted of mulching of cotton plants after harvest, followed by disc -ploughing and \nincorporation of cotton stalks to 0.2 m, chisel ploughing to 0.3 m followed by the construction of beds \nat spacings of 1 m. Minimum tillage comprised mulching of cotton plants after harvest, followed by root \ncutting and incorporation of cotton stalks into beds to 0.1 m depth (to facilitate Helicoverpa spp. pupae \ndestruction), and bed renovation with a disc-hiller. From 1995 to 1999, wheat stubble was incorporated \nwith a disc-hiller before sowing cotton, but thereafter it was retained as standing stubble into which the \nfollowing cotton crop was sown (Hulugalle et al., 2005). Conventional cotton was sown from 1985 to \n1999, and genetically modified cotton varieties thereafter. The field had a slope of 0.1%. The experiment \nwas re-designed in 2011 by splitting all plots and sowing either hybrid maize ( Zea mays L.) varieties \nduring the summer following the previous year’s cotton (with respect to the cotton-wheat, this involved \nsowing maize immediately after wheat but before the next years cotton crop) or retaining the historical \ncropping system as a control. The experiment was laid out as a split -plot design where the historical \ntillage/rotation system combinations were designated as main plot treatments and +/- maize as sub-plots, \nreplicated four times. The six treatments, thus, were: (1) maximum-tilled cotton monoculture (Max CC), \n(2) maximum-tilled cotton-maize (Max CM), (3) minimum -tilled cotton monoc ulture (Min CC), (4) \nminimum-tilled cotton -maize (Min CM), (5) minimum -tilled cotton -wheat (Min WCF) and (6) \nminimum-tilled cotton-wheat-maize (Min WCM) (Table 11.1). Cotton and rotation crops were irrigated \nat an average rate of 100 mm subject to water av ailability, rainfall, and soil water content. All crops \nwere harvested mechanically with cotton picking occurring after chemical defoliation. Maize stalks were \nmanaged by adjusting the header height, slashing and root cutting such that only shredded residues were \nleft on the surface after harvest. These residues decomposed by the time of cotton sowing. Details of the \nfield layout and crop management were reported by Hulugalle et al. (2020) and Nachimuthu et al. \n(2018). \n \nTable 11.1 Treatment details and rotation history of fields C1 and D1 over the experimental period \n(1993 to 2015) \nField C1 C1 C1 C1 C1 C1 \nHistoric treatment (1985-2011) Max CC Max CC Min CC Min CC Min WCF Min WCF \nTreatment (2011-2015) Max CC Max CM Min CC Min CM Min WCF \nMin \nWCM \nTillage depth 0.3 m 0.3 m 0.1 m 0.1 m 0.1 m 0.1 m \nSummer crop even years Cotton Maize Cotton Maize Cotton Maize \nSummer crop even years total fertiliser (kg N ha-\n1) 240-260  240-260  240-260  240-260  240-260  240-260  \nWinter crop even years Fallow Fallow Fallow Fallow Fallow Fallow \nWinter crop even years total fertiliser (kg N ha-1) - - - - - - \nSummer crop odd years Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton Cotton \nSummer crop odd years total fertiliser (kg N ha-1) 240-260  240-260  240-260  240-260  240-260  240-260  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n126 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n2.2.2 Field D1  \nThe soil at the commencement of the study during 2002 was a deep, uniform grey clay and classified as \na fine, thermic, smectitic, Typic Haplustert (Soil Survey Staff 2014).

All treatments were sown after minimum tillage, viz. disc-\nhilling to repair 1m spaced beds before planting each year. Post-harvest, cotton plants were slashed and \nroot-cut before the stalks were incorporated into the beds. The experiment was laid out as a randomised \ncomplete block with three replications and designed such that both cotton and rotation crop phases in \nT3 and T4 were sown every year, resulting in a total of 18 plots. Individual plots were 158-177 m long \nand 16 rows wide. The rows (beds) were spaced at 1 m intervals with vehicular traffic being restricted \nto the furrows. Conventional cotton was sown from 2002 to 2006, with GM varieties sown thereafter. \nDetails of the experiment, its management and its impact on cotton agronomy, e nergy efficiency, soil \nquality, carbon dynamics and hydrology have been reported previously (Hulugalle et al., 2010; 2012; \n2017; 2013). Further field details are outlined in Table 11.1.  \n2.2.3 Fields 3 and 4 \nThe soil was a deep, uniform grey clay and classified as a fine, thermic, smectitic, Typic Haplustert (Soil \nSurvey Staff 2014). At the 0-0.1 m depth it had a particle size distribution of 40 g 100 g-1 clay (<2 μm), \n13 g 100 g-1 silt (2–20 μm) and 47 g 100 g -1 sand (20 μm–2 mm), was acid and had an average pH in \n0.01 M CaCl2 of 5.6 and was non-saline (electrical conductivity (EC1:5) was 0.124 dS m-1). Fields 3 and \n4 were under conservation tillage for dryland cropping (the only operations were drilling seeds and \nfertilisers). During the 2019 winter c ropping season (April sowing to November harvest) field 3 was \nsown with wheat and field 4 with chickpeas ( Cicer arietinum L.). A starter fertiliser of Granulock® Z \ncontaining 11% N, 21.8% phosphorus, 4% sulfur and 1% zinc was drilled with an air seeder bet ween \n0.02-0.04 m before sowing. Post -harvest standing stubble was retained in both fields. Each field was \nconsidered as a treatment with three replications in each. \n2.3 Sampling and analysis  \nSoil samples were taken 20 m from the head ditch and tail drain ends of each plot with a tractor-mounted \nhydraulic soil corer and divided into depths of 0 -0.15, 0.15-0.3, 0.3-0.45 and 0.45 -0.6 m in field C1 \nduring 1993 and 2015 and 0 -0.1, 0.1-0.3 and 0.3-0.6 m in field D1 during 2002 and 2015.  Additional \nsoil cores wer e taken during 2019 from field D1 at ACRI and in Fields 3 and 4 in Edgeroi using a \nChristie engineering post driver to drive steel coring tubes  (0.042 m inside diameter) i nto the ground to be \nextracted with a tube puller. The cores from field D1 were taken in the tail drain, middle and head ditch \nend and bulked together at corresponding depths (0 -0.02, 0.02-0.04, 0.04-0.06, 0.06-0.08 and 0.08-0.1 \nm) for each plot. Three soil cores were taken for each replication within a field and bulked together at \ncorresponding depths (0-0.02, 0.02-0.04, 0.04-0.06, 0.06-0.08 and 0.08-0.1 m) from fields 3 and 4. Soils \nwere air dried at 40◦C. Samples from 1993 and 2002 were ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve by hand \nwith a mortar and pestle. The samples from 2015 and 2019 were ground with a jaw crusher before being \npulverised by hand with a mortar and pestle to pass through a 2 mm sieve. Head ditch and tail drain \nsamples from each plot were mixed to produce a composite sample for each depth and archived as soon \nas possible after sampling and processing. In 2019 all the archived samples were analysed \nsimultaneously for pH (1:5 soil:0.01 M CaCl 2) and electrical conductivity (1:5 soil:water suspension). \nDiethylenetriamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) analysis was used to remove Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe absorbed \non solid phases, along with water -soluble constituents to simulate plant root uptake and act as an \nestimate of micronutrient plant availability (Rayment and Lyons, 2010). The analysis was performed \nfor 2 h on air-dried soil at a soil:solution ratio of 1:2 and buffered to pH 7.3 (suited to alkaline soils in \nthis experiment). DTPA Zn was not reported in 2015 due to the potential contamination of samples \nduring processing which only impacted Zn. Consequently, the soil was re -sampled from selected plots \n(T2 – continuous cotton and T4 – cotton – wheat standing stubble) in 2020 from field D1 and analysed \nfor DTPA Zn. The results from 2020 were compared with 2002 samples from the same treatments. \nFurther analyses for total Cu, Zn, Mn, and Fe were conducted by scanning with a lab -mounted Bruker \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n128 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nTracer III -SD portable X -ray fluorescence (pXRF) machine using settings calibrated for Vertisols \n(McLaren et al., 2012). The pXRF non -destructively measures the unique elemental characteristics  of \neach micronutrient through the level of X-ray energy omitted by the element while irradiated by a source \nof excitation, thereby indicating the total amount of specific elements within a sample.  \n2.4 Statistical analysis \nEach field’s results were individually analysed by analysis of variance for a split -plot design, except \nfield C1 in 2015 which was analysed as a split -split plot design to account for the introduction of the \nmaize treatment as split-plots. Treatment was designated as the main-plot treatment and sampling depth \nas the sub -plot treatment for fields C1 and D1. For fields 3 and 4, field history was considered as \ntreatment main plots and depth as subplots. Pairwise comparisons used the least significant difference \nconditional on significant (p < 0.05) effects detected by analysis of variance. Heterogeneity of variance \nand normal distributions for all responses were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using \nGenStat 20th Edition (VSN International Ltd). \n3 Results and discussion \n3.1  Whole profile micronutrient changes under varying tillage and crop rotations (0-0.6 \nm depth) \n3.1.1 Whole profile XRF total micronutrients (0-0.6 m depth) \nThe XRF analysis did not show any evidence of declines in total micronutrients (supplementary data) \nwithin this experiment. Total Cu in field D1 (reported as XRF counts) increased by 4% from 2002 to \n2015 (p < 0.05) in the 0 -0.6 m depth, however, there was no evidence of stratification. Mean total Fe, \nMn, and Zn (0 -0.6 m depth) did not change with time. Whil e the increase in total Cu could not be \nexplained in this experiment, elsewhere it could be attributed to fungicide application or a trace element \nin a fertiliser product (Schneider et al., 2019; Wyszkowski and Brodowska, 2021).  \nThe Vertisols of north-west New South Wales are inherently fertile with rich nutrient status, although \nsome of the other nutrients such as phosphorus are declining (Nachimuthu et al., 2022). Cropping on \nAustralian soils has been relatively recent compared to most countries (Bellotti and Rochecouste, 2014). \nThis study indicates that total micronutrient status has not been altered to a level which can be detected \nusing current analytical methods. These two fields were under intensive cropping (22 and 13 years for \nfields C1 and D1, respectively) over the experimental period. There was no fertiliser application of any \nmicronutrients (Cu, Fe, Mn, or Zn) during this experimental period despite nutrient export in harvested \nseeds in those years. This suggests that the micronutrient reserves in these cotton-growing Vertisols are \nnot depleted and appropriate soil management to improve micronutrient availability will be the \ndeterminant factor of plant acquisition (Wei et al., 2006).  \n3.1.2 Changes in whole profile (0-0.6 m depth) DTPA-extractable micronutrient concentrations \nover the long term \nThe results suggest that DTPA Cu concentrations declined by 18% (p < 0.05) and DTPA Fe increased \nby 23% (p < 0.05) over 22 years in field C1 (Figure 11.1A, 11.1B), averaged across 0-0.6 m depth. Over \n13 years in field D1, there were no observed changes to mean DTPA Cu from 0-0.6 m while DTPA Fe \ndeclined by 36% (p < 0.001) (Figure 11.2A, 11.2B). Mean DTPA Mn remained similar in field C1 when \ncompared from 1993 to 2015 and field D1 from 2002 to 2015 across 0 -0.6 m depth, however, differed \nin field C1 in 2015 when separated by treatment (p < 0.001) (Table 11.2). There was no change in \naverage DTPA Zn concentration in the 0-0.6 m depth (Figure 11.2D).  \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n129 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n \nFigure 1.1 DTPA extractable micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) concentration (mg kg -1) of a Vertisol in \nfield C1 (1993 and 2015) from 0-0.6 m depth.

Therefore, DTPA Mn was higher under \nminimum than maximum tillage, and was higher when cereal crops (wheat or maize) were included in \nthe rotation. As there we re no changes in XRF Mn across treatments, the results suggest that Mn \navailability from 0 -0.6 m depth was driven by changes in soil properties. DTPA Mn was positively \ncorrelated with soil organic carbon (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.7), which has been observed in ot her studies \n(Cotter and Mishra, 1968; Reiss and Chifflard, 2015). Additionally, Terry et al. (2008) reported that \ncotton-wheat rotations increased SOC when compared to continuous cotton in irrigated Vertisols. \nFurthermore, including maize within continuous  cotton and cotton –wheat systems increased surface \nSOC concentrations, compared to rotations without maize (Hulugalle et al., 2020). Hence DTPA -\nextractable Mn availability was likely driven by soil organic carbon, which in turn was influenced by \ntillage and crop rotation practices. In contrast to our results, Wright et al. (2007) found no influence of \ntillage on Mn availability in their 4-year nutrient stratification study under cotton rotations in an alkaline \nTexas silty clay loam. This may have been due to the short time frame of their study (4 years) whereas \nthe duration of our study was 22 years. Unlike in our study, soil carbon results were not reported by \nWright et al. (2007) and thus it is not possible to comment on the relationship between SOC and Mn  \navailability in their study. Tillage and cropping system did not significantly affect mean DTPA Fe in \nfield C1 (Figure 11.1B) or field D1 (Figure 11.2B) from 0-0.6 m depths. Similarly, there was no change \nin XRF Fe over time, indicating no change in total  Fe, therefore the changes to DTPA Fe were due to \ntemporal changes in soil properties that were unrelated to treatment, regulating plant availability. The \nthree chemical processes which typically are responsible for Fe availability in soils are pH, chelati on, \nand redox potential (Eh) during waterlogging (Fageria and Nascente, 2014; Husson, 2013; Lucena et \nal., 1987). The most easily observed of these factors is soil pH, which decreased from 7.5 in 1993 to 7.3 \nin 2015 (0-0.6 m depth) in field C1 and was negatively correlated with DTPA Fe (R 2= 0.34, p < 0.001). \nConversely, pH in field D1 increased over 13 years from 6.9 to 7.4 (0 -0.6 m depth) but was also \nnegatively correlated with DTPA Fe (p < 0.05). As soil pH decreases, the solubility of Fe increases \n(Fageria and Nascente, 2014; Haynes and Swift, 1985; Sarkar and Jones, 1982). Generally, root exudates \nincreasing Fe availability in the rhizosphere play a significant role in Fe-deficient soils (Prasad, 2011). \nHowever, there was no Fe deficiency observed in either field C1 or D1 and it is unlikely that Fe chelation \nsignificantly affected changes to mean DTPA Fe from 0-0.6 m. While Fe is susceptible to state changes \nunder the influence of redox and the experimental fields were flood irrigated (on average 6-7 times per \ngrowing season), there was no Fe-induced plant stress observed in this experiment due to anaerobiosis \nin the 0-0.6 m depth. This is despite research indicating that at least 48 hours is required for cotton root \nfunction to return in Vertisols after waterlogging (Dodd et al., 2013). While pH appears to be the main \ndriver of DTPA Fe concentration changes in this experiment, it is important to note that there is an \ninterconnected relationship between pH and Eh. The nature of this relationship is complex , and \nchallenging to assess under field conditions, and the literature is often contradictory concerning its \nsignificance (de Mars and Wassen, 1999; Fiedler et al., 2007; Rabenhorst et al., 2009; Unger et al., \n2008). \nWhile there was no Fe toxicity observed  in this study, Australian cotton -producing soils are predicted \nto acidify over the long term (Singh et al., 2003), which may lead to the over -availability of Fe in the \nfuture. The chemical reaction resulting from the application of N as urea or anhydrous ammonia may \ntemporarily increase soil pH as NH3 removes H+ ions from the soil in conversion to NH4+, however as \nNH4+ converts to NO3- the H+ ions will be released back to the soil, resulting in an overall pH decrease \nas this second reaction is more powerful (Janke et al., 2022). These risks are amplified by the over -\napplication of N within Australian cotton systems and could therefore be mitigated by improved N use \nefficiency (Macdonald et al., 2018). Further, it is common practice in Australian irrigated cotton systems \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n132 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nto deliver a top dressing of urea applied via irrigation water around peak flowering (Latimer, 2018). This \ncould result in tem porary pH flux and impact micronutrient availability at a time when crop \nmicronutrient demand is high. \nDespite the decline of mean DTPA Cu (0-0.6 m) in field C1 (Figure 11.1A), there was no influence of \ntillage or crop rotation observed. This decline contr asts with previous studies reporting increased Cu \navailability with decreasing soil pH (Fageria and Nascente, 2014; Oorts, 2013). Copper is considered to \nbe the most easily bound by organic matter (Mengel et al., 2001) among the micronutrient cations in \nthis study, however, the soil management practices for genetically -modified cotton require pupae \nbusting, even for minimum tilled plots which may enhance breakdown of crop residues. As a result, the \nmass of residues retained may be insufficient to induce a m easurable difference in binding the Cu and \nits availability. Copper availability can be complex. Brennan (1999) stated environmental factors, \nincluding temperature, light and water can all impact Cu availability to plants. The soil DTPA Cu \nconcentration in fields C1 and D1 did not approach deficiency or toxicity levels. \n3.2 Influence of tillage and crop rotation on patterns of micronutrient stratification \n3.2.1 Patterns of stratification in XRF total micronutrients  \nAmong the four micronutrients investigated in fields C1 and D1, only Fe and Cu in field C1 indicated a \npattern of stratification. XRF Fe was observed in decreasing order of concentration from top depth (0 -\n0.15 m) to lower depth (0.45 -0.6 m) in both 1993 and 2015. XRF Cu in field C1 was significan tly \ndifferent across depths, but there was no change in the pattern of concentration between 1993 and 2015. \nChanges in XRF Fe and Cu were not influenced by tillage or crop rotation. There were no changes in \nXRF Mn or Zn. Despite 22 years of micronutrient r emoval via crop harvest, the unaltered total \nmicronutrient levels suggest these Vertisols have a considerable total supply for the future. \n3.2.2 Patterns of stratification in DTPA-extractable micronutrients  \nWhile stratification was observed in DTPA Cu, Zn and Mn at different times within fields C1 and D1, \nonly DTPA Mn was influenced by tillage and crop rotation. There was no evidence of DTPA Fe \nstratification in this experiment.  \nStratification of DTPA Cu was only observed in field C1 during 1993 as concentration was 20% lower \nin the 0-0.15 m depth than in the 0.15-0.6 m depth (p < 0.05) and was not seen in field C1 during 2015 \n(Figure 11.1A), or field D1 during 2002 or 2015 (Figure 11.2A). The decline of mean DTPA Cu from \n1993 to 2015 in 0-0.6 m depth in field C1 may be responsible for the absence of surface stratification as \nit occurred mostly in the 0.15-0.6 m depths. As previously noted, Cu availability is complex (Brennan, \n1999) and as there was no observed Cu toxicity or deficiency the drivers of avail ability within this \nexperiment were not investigated further.  \nThere was no evidence of DTPA Zn stratification in field C1 during 1993 (contaminated DTPA Zn \nresults during 2015 not presented), however, DTPA Zn was stratified in field D1 during both 2002 and \n2020 irrespective of crop rotation or soil management and the pattern of stratification remained similar \nbetween years (mean of 1.17 mg kg -1 in 0-0.1 m depth compared to 0.41 mg kg -1 in 0.1-0.6 m depth) \n(Figure 11.2D). The combination of minimum tillage in field D1 that did not disturb the soil below 0.1 \nm depth and the immobile nature of Zn is the likely cause of the stratified concentration in the 0-0.1 m \ndepth. Furthermore, post-harvest crop residue mulching may have further concentrated Zn in the surface \n0-0.1 m. DTPA Zn concentration in the subsoil (0.1 -0.6 m) during both years was below 0.5 mg kg-1, \nthe proposed critical concentration for Zn deficiency (CRDC and CottonInfo, 2018; GRDC, 2013) and \nwell below the values observed by Constable et al. (1988). Rochester et al. (2012) reported that 73% of \nZn uptake in cotton occurred during peak flowering, which could highlight a risk of yield reduction if \nDTPA Zn is below the critical concentration within the extraction zone. While DTPA Zn concentration \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n133 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nmay indicate a potential deficiency, plant tissue tests are more accurate in confirmation and should be \nconsidered in conjunction with soil properties including pH and field history (Norton, 2014). \nDTPA Mn was stratified in fields C1 and D1 over the 22 and 13 -year experiments in each field, \nrespectively. Both tillage and crop rotation influenced DTPA Mn stratification in field C1 (Table 11.2). \nWhen treatments in C1 during 2015 were separated by tillage (maximum compared to minimum tillage), \nresults indicated a greater magnitude of stratification under minimum tillage (159% greater DTPA Mn \nconcentration in the 0-0.15 m than in the 0.15-0.6 m depth) than maximum tillage (74% greater DTPA \nMn concentration in the 0-0.15 m depth than in the 0.15-0.6 m depth). However, there was no influence \nof treatment in field D1. Mean DTPA Mn was 13% higher in the 0-0.15 m than in the 0.15-0.6 m depth \n(p < 0.05) and 103% higher in the 0 -0.1 m depth than in the 0.1 -0.6 m depth (p < 0.05) in fields C1 \nduring 1993 (Figure 11.1C) and D 1 during 2002 (Figure 11.2C), respectively. The magnitude of \nstratification increased over time in both fields as DTPA Mn concentration during 2015 in field C1 was \n116% higher (p < 0.05) in the 0 -0.15 m depth than in the 0.15 -0.6 m depth, and 177% higher in the 0-\n0.1 m depth than in the 0.1-0.6 m depth in field D1. As stated in Section 3.1.2, during 2015 there was a \npositive correlation between SOC and DTPA Mn concentration in field C1, which was also observed in \nfield D1 (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.68). As soil car bon has a positive relationship with Mn availability, \nmanagement practices that influence SOC are likely to influence DTPA Mn concentration. Cotton crops \nare mechanically mulched post-harvest, returning organic material to the surface soil. Under maximum \ntillage, the organic material is mixed through the top 0 -0.3 m of soil, whereas minimum tillage \nconcentrates organic material in the top 0 -0.1 m depth. The accumulation of SOC in the topsoil under \nminimum tillage was also observed by Haddaway et al. (2017). As Mn is extracted from all depths this \ncould explain the decline in concentration at depth, compared to the increase in the topsoil. The same \ncan be said for the other micronutrients, however, within this experiment, other factors appear to have \nhad a more significant influence on their DTPA-extractability.  \n3.3 Tillage effects on topsoil stratification  \nA requirement of growing Bt cotton in Australia is pupae busting tillage (a tillage pass to at least 0.1 m \ndepth to facilitate the destruction of Helicoverpa spp. pupae) after cotton harvest if the crop has not been \ndefoliated by March 31st (CottonInfo, 2018). For this reason, minimum -tilled irrigated cotton systems \nin Australia will often undergo an annual tillage operation, mixing soil to at least 0.1 m depth. To \nunderstand the impact of topsoil tillage on micronutrient stratification in irrigated cotton systems, we \ncompared samples from two treatments (continuous cotton and cotton–wheat rotation) of field D1 with \nsamples from two fields (fields 3 and 4) of a nearby broadacre farm of similar soil type, under \nconservation tillage for dryland cropping (the only operation is drilling seeds and fertilisers).  \n3.3.1 Tillage effects on XRF total micronutrient stratification in the topsoil \nTotal Fe (reported as XRF counts) was 59% lower in the dryland compared to the irrigated site averaged \nfrom 0-0.1 m depth (p < 0.05). XRF Fe at both sites followed a similar pattern of stratification showing \na 4% higher concentration from 0-0.04 m, than in the 0.04-0.1 m depths (p < 0.05). Despite the difference \nin average XRF Fe between the irrigated and dryland sites, the similarities in stratification suggest this \nis likely due to the underlying soil geology and not differences in tillage practices. XRF Zn was stratified \nand followed the same pattern of stratification over both sites, being 8% higher in concentration in the \n0-0.04 m than in the 0.04-0.1 m depth (p < 0.05). The concentration of XRF Zn was 33% higher in the \nirrigated compared to the dryland site in the 0-0.1 m depth (p < 0.05), which may be reflective of higher \nnatural fertility at the irrigated site. There was no stratification or evidence of differences between the \ndryland and irrigated sites for XRF Cu or Mn (data not presented).  \n3.3.2 Tillage effects on DTPA-extractable micronutrient stratification in the topsoil \nAll DTPA micronutrients in this study were stratified in the 0-0.1 m depth of both fields 3 and 4 of the \ndryland site. Comparatively, in field D1 only DTPA Mn was stratified in both treatments, while DTPA \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n134 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nFe stratification differed between treatments and there was no stratification observed in either DTPA Cu \nor Zn in the 0 -0.1 m depth. The difference in stratification between DTPA Cu and Zn in the dryland \ncompared to the irrigated site indicate the influence of tillage on these micronutrients, however, suggests \nthat there was a reduced influence of tillage on DTPA Fe or Mn stratification in the topsoil. \nThere was a negative correlation observed between DTPA Fe and soil pH (p < 0.05) across the combined \ntreatments of the dryland and both treatments of the irrigated sites. While pH was a significant driver of \nFe availability, relatively low correlation coefficients in the continuous cotton and cotton –wheat \nrotations (Table 11.3) suggest the influence of other factors. Table 11.3 shows that when comparing \ndepth intervals below 0-0.02 m, DTPA Fe was always higher under cotton-wheat than continuous cotton \nrotations. Cereal monocots (i.e. wheat) are capable of exuding phytosiderophores, used to create zones \nof increased Fe availability within their rhizospheres (Rengel and Römheld, 2000; Wallace, 1981). This \nmay translate to greater Fe uptake, and therefore greater plant availability of Fe in the form of post -\nharvest organic material returns in the wheat rotation than compared to continuous cotton.  \nTable 11.3 DTPA Fe concentration (mg kg -1) and pH (CaCl 2) in dryland (average of chickpeas and \nwheat) compared to irrigated continuous cotton (CC) and cotton – wheat (CW) rotation from 0 -0.1 m \ndepth \n \nDryland Irrigated \n  \nDepth (m) DTPA Fe pH DTPA Fe CC DTPA Fe CW pH CC pH CW \n0-0.02 30 5.4 22 18 6.8 6.7 \n0.02-0.04 32 5.3 20 22 6.9 6.8 \n0.04-0.06 28 5.4 19 22 6.9 6.8 \n0.06-0.08 24 5.8 19 23 6.9 6.9 \n0.08-0.1 19 5.9 21 22 6.9 6.8 \nR2 0.66   0.47 0.21     \nLSD (p = 0.05) \nTreatment*Depth \n34.62 2.05 5.22 0.17 \n \nStratification of DTPA Mn was observed regardless of tillage, with concentrations 61% and 73% higher \nin the dryland and irrigated sites, respectively when comparing the 0 -0.04 m and 0.04 -0.1 m depths \n(Figure 11.3C, 11.3D). The stratification of DTPA Mn was  in contrast to XRF Mn, as there was no \nevidence of stratification or differences in concentration between the dryland and irrigated sites. \nManganese concentration (DTPA extractable) was negatively correlated with pH in the no-till wheat (p \n< 0.001, R 2 = 0 .73) and no -till chickpea (p < 0.05, R 2 = 0.5) rotations of the dryland site and the \ncontinuous cotton (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.32) in the irrigated site. While this regression satisfactorily explains \nDTPA Mn concentration in dryland no-till wheat, the variance in the other crop rotations as well as the \nlack of relationship between DTPA Mn and pH in irrigated cotton wheat show that Mn availability was \ndriven by additional factors under dryland and irrigated systems which need further investigation. As \nreported in previous Section 3.2.2, there was a positive correlation between DTPA Mn and SOC in the \nirrigated field in 2015 (4 years before the 2019 sampling event). This may account for DTPA Mn \nstratification in the irrigated treatments as these are under minimum tillage in this field, which suggests \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n135 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nSOC may also be stratified. Knezek and Greinert (1971) stated that as more Fe is introduced into the \nsoil solution, Mn will become less plant available, however, our study found a positive correlation in \ndryland no-till chickpeas between DTPA Fe and DTPA Mn and no correlation in the other rotations. \nKochian (1991) observed that a negative correlation between Fe and Mn availability had been widely \nreported and suggested that Mn availability may have been increased in Fe -deficient soils as this can \ninduce some plant roots to exude chelating agents which alter the soil conditions of the rhizosphere. \nWhile the changes in soil conditions are targeting Fe solubilisation, Fe and Mn are often influenced by \nsimilar properties, thereby increasing Mn as well as Fe availability. The positive correlation between \nDTPA Fe and Mn in our study is likely reflective of similar soil properties driving their availability. \nComparing the results of previous studies to ours highlights the complexity of micronutrient availability \nand the importance of soil properties in controlling micronutrient dynamics. \n \n \nFigure 11.3 DTPA extractable micronutrient (Fe, Mn) concentration (mg kg -1) of Vertisols in field D1 \nunder cotton monoculture and cotton wheat rotation and fields 3 and 4 under no -till chickpeas and no-\ntill wheat from 0-0.1 m depth. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. \n \nCopper (DTPA extractable) within the dryland site was 13% higher in the 0-0.04 m depth, compared to \nthe 0.04-0.1 m depth (Figure 11.4B) however there was no stratification at the irrigated site.

Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. \n \nAlthough the stratification of DTPA Zn in the dryland compared to the irrigated site appears to be \ninfluenced by tillage, a major difference between the two sites is the dryland site regularly received a \nstarting fertiliser containing Zn before winter crop planting. This is reflected in the concentration of \nDTPA Zn at the dryland site being 174% higher in the top 0-0.04 m depth, than the 0.04-0.1 m depth. It \nis evident that despite the use of a Zn-containing fertiliser, DTPA extractable Zn in the 0.08-0.1 m depth \nfell below the 0.5 mg kg-1 critical soil concentration at the dryland site, which may indicate potential Zn \ndeficiency (CRDC and CottonInfo, 2018; GRDC, 2013). Similarly, within the irrigated site DTPA Zn \nconcentration fell below 0.5 mg kg-1 between 0.02-0.04 m depth and 0.08-0.1 m depth. As mean DTPA \nZn concentration from 0-0.1 m depth over these sites were 1.39 mg kg-1 and 0.54 mg kg-1 in dryland and \nirrigated sites respectively, the average concentration with usual commercial soil sampling increments \n(i.e. 0-0.1 m, 0.1-0.3 m, 0.3-0.6 m etc.), may not reflect the actual amount available to the plant at key \ntimes. Planting at a deeper depth to place the seed proximal to soil moisture is a common practice. In \nsuch instances, if the seeds are planted below 0.05 m depth where the Zn concentration levels were \n\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n137 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nbelow the soil test critical value, the seedlings may suffer a Zn deficiency during early crop growth. To \nminimise these issues under no-till cropping systems, strategic tillage could offer a potential solution to \ndistribute the stratified nutrients across the planting zones and minimise the risk of stratification (Dang \net al., 2018). \n4 Conclusion  \nThere was no evidence of decline or changes in stratification of total micronutrients in intensively \nmanaged Vertisols. However, stratification and decline were observed in DTPA-extractable Mn, Cu, Fe \nand Zn in some ti llage and crop rotation systems in long -term cotton experiments. Micronutrient \nextractability was related to changes in soil properties, specifically pH and SOC, rather than reduced \ntotal micronutrient status. Tillage frequency influenced soil properties and reduced topsoil stratification. \nGreater variation in micronutrient extractability in the topsoil (0-0.1 m depth), compared to the subsoil \n(below 0.1 m depth) was observed when sampling in 0.02 m increments, which would be masked if \nsampling in standard 0.1 m increments. Excepting Zn, DTPA -extractable Mn, Fe or Cu were not \nobserved nearing critical deficiency concentrations, and therefore micronutrient stratification and \ndecline in irrigated cotton-growing Vertisols are unlikely to be yield limiting, provided that surface soil \nproperties are well managed. The findings of this study will be useful for benchmarking the \nmicronutrient status after an extended period of cropping in the future and also for the soil management \ndecisions (such as pH and SOC). Aust ralian cotton growing regions are expanding, in some cases to \nareas of less fertile soil types, such as the duplex soils (Alfisols, Aridisols, Ultisols) of southern New \nSouth Wales. These soils require further investigation to determine the influence of mi cronutrient \nstratification and the decline in their productivity. Future research should also consider environmental \nimpacts (temperature, light, oxygen exposure) on micronutrient speciation and the limitations of DTPA \nextraction in accurately replicating soil conditions. \nAcknowledgements  \nThe funding provided by the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) through the \nproject DAN1801 is gratefully acknowledged.

The average loss of tensile strength of cotton strips buried 3 to 35 days in \nsoils from two long-term tillage and crop-rotation experiments was of the order: cotton-wheat rotation \n> minimum-tillage cotton monoculture > maximum-tillage cotton monoculture. The study suggests CSA \ncan be an effective indicator to delineate microbial activity, soil organic carbon or crop biomass as \ninfluenced by agricultural practices in cotton fields.  \nKeywords: Loss of tensile strength, decomposition, soil health, cotton systems, assay \n1 Introduction \nSoil biological functions are key components of soil health. Microbial breakdown of organic matter is a \nfundamental soil ecosystem process that enhances nutrient cycling. The Cotton Strip Assay (CSA) is a \npractical ecological indicator tool (Nachimuthu et al., 2007; Tiegs et al., 2013; Carballeira et al., 2020; \nJabiol et al., 2020). A standard cotton cloth is buried in the soil and the loss of cotton fibre strength over \ntime is used as an indirect measure of cellulose degradation by soil microbes (Correll et al., 1997).  \nThe mechanical harvest of cotton crops often results in incomplete recovery of the lint produced \n(Faulkner et al., 2011), thus the microbial communities of cotton -producing soils are habituated to the \ndecomposition of cellulose in the form of cotton fibres. Therefore, the CSA should be particularly well \nsuited to detect changes in soil microbial activity as a result of soil management. Soil microbial functions \nin soils used to grow cotton have previously been conducted using detailed laboratory -based analyses \n(Polain et al., 2021), but here we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of the simple and inexpensive CSA \nto detect the effects of various cotton cropping systems treatments on microbial decomposition of cotton \nin soils cropped with cotton. \n2 Materials and Methods \nTwo incubation experiments were conducted using surface soils (0–10 cm) sampled from two long-term \nfield experiments on Vertisols- the dominant cotton-growing soils in Australia. The soil characteristics \nfor both experiments are described in Nachimuthu et al. (2018) and Hulugalle et al. (2013), respectively. \nExperiment 1 (ongoing since 1985) included soils collected from six cropping systems: (1a) minimum-\ntillage cotton -monoculture, (1b) minimum -tillage cotton -maize, (1c) maximum -tillage cotton -\nmonoculture, (1d) maximum-tillage cotton-maize, (1e) minimum-tillage cotton-wheat, (1f) minimum-\ntillage cotton-wheat-maize. Maximum and minimum tillage practices include soil disturbance to 30 and \n10 cm respectively. Experiment 2 (ongoing since 2002) included four crop -sequences under minimum \ntillage: (2a) cotton-oats cover crop, (2b) cotton monoculture, (2c) cotton-wheat ~ standing stubble, (2d) \ncotton-wheat ~ stubble incorporated. \nSoils were sampled two weeks before incubation and air -dried under aerobic conditions (19 -32 0C). \nAfter stones and large organic debris were removed, the soil was broken into small clumps by hand and \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n146 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nhomogenised. The standard cotton strips (60 mm x 60 mm x 0.65 mm) used (Mittal International, 2022) \nhad a thread count of 38/cm to ensure the same number of threads were broken in  the tensometer (as \ndescribed in Nachimuthu et al.  (2007)) during later measurement of tensile strength. Soils were \nincubated in 80 mm tall plastic containers (110 mm diameter) with three holes in the bottom to ensure \nthe draining of excess water. First, soil was added to a depth of 20 mm and a cotton strip was placed on \nthe soil. Then, another 20 mm of the same soil was added, followed by another cotton strip and another \n20 mm of the soil. Total air-dried (6% moisture) soil weight was 365 grams. Deionised water (200 ml) \nwas added t o saturate the soil (mimicking flood irrigation conditions used for growing cotton in \nAustralia). The excess water drained leaving the soil moisture content at the drained upper limit (soil \nwater content at potentials of -10 kPa for this soil was about 0.4 2 m3/m3 (Hulugalle et al., 2017)). The \nincubation experiment was conducted under controlled temperature (26°C average) with cotton strips \ndestructively retrieved after 3, 7, 12, 18, 25 and 35 days. Each treatment was replicated three times with \ntwo cotton strips in each container as described above. The extracted strips were rinsed in distilled water, \nair-dried (40 °C) for 48 hours, then broken in the tensometer to measure the tensile strength (Nachimuthu \net al., 2007). The tensometer was calibrated using a digital tension balance. The results indicated every \n10 mm movement of the counter balance was equal to 1 kg weight. The control strips (unburied) were \nbroken as a reference for determining loss of tensile strength (LTS) as below,  \nLTS (%) = (((kg to break control strip) – (kg to break sample strip))/ kg to break control strip) * 100 \nThe above ground shoots were removed from 2 m of plant row in each plot at maximum biomass stage \nand dry weight measure d after drying them at 70 °C until constant weight. The bolls and vegetative \ncomponents were partitioned to obtain vegetative and total dry biomass. The soil organic carbon was \nmeasured using Walkley Black method as described in Nachimuthu et al. (2018). \nStatistical analysis was carried out using Genstat Version 21.1.1.2 (VSN International Ltd) by treating \nexperiment 1 as a split-plot design with the historical cropping system as main plots and maize rotation \nas sub plots. Experiment 2 was analysed as a randomised block design. \n3 Results and Discussion \nThe LTS results from experiment 1 was of the order of cotton-wheat systems (55.3) > minimum-tillage \ncotton-monoculture (52.3) > maximum -tillage cotton -monoculture (47.1) (Figure 12.1, LSD at \nP<0.05=2.90). Senapati et al.  (2014) observed a similar trend for the long -term average yields and \ncarbon inputs for these three systems. Likewise, the same trend was observed for the vegetative biomass \nof cotton grown in th ese three treatments during the 2020 –21 season (Table 12.1). The preseason soil \norganic carbon levels suggest cotton -wheat systems > maximum - tillage cotton-monoculture (Table \n12.1). \nThe LTS results from soils of crop sequencing experiment (experiment 2) s howed lower microbial \ndegradation in the cotton -oats cover crop (2a) (55.8%) than in the cotton - wheat stubble incorporated \nsystem (2d) (62.2%) (P=0.077). The observed result could be due to the greater volume of fresh residues \nin the cover crop system competing with the cotton strips for microbial decomposition. Changes in the \nquantity and quality of carbon compounds supplied to the soil has the potential to modify the activity of \nmicrobial communities, its composition and impact organic matter decomposition by the priming effect \n(Osanai et al., 2020). Degradation over time (extraction days) was si gnificantly different in both the \nexperiments (Figure 12.2, P<0.001).  \nThe observed LTS results indicate that this technique was sensitive enough to delineate microbial \ndegradation differences among treatments in a laboratory environment using soil from agricultural field \nexperiments. It is also less expensive than using a laboratory respirometer to measure microbial activity \nat a single point in time (Nachimuthu et al., 2007). Our study suggests CSA has potential to be used as \na soil biological activity indicator in field experiments. Currently,  the only visual indicator of soil \nbiology recommended by the FAO, when assessing soil health, is the number of earthworms per square \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n147 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nmeter (Shepherd et al., 2008). The CSA has excellent potential to be deployed as a simple technique to \nmonitor soil biological activity in warmer semi-arid environments where earthworms are rare, and could \nbe added to the recommended FAO-visual soil assessment methods. Soil health is the continued capacity \nof soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals and humans (Lehmann et al., \n2020). Interest in soil health across the Australian cotton farming and school community has recently \nbeen boosted by the Australian cotton industry extension network in the form of a ‘soil your undies’ \ncampaign (CottonInfo, 2022). Expanding the efforts of the engagement generated by this campaign to \nthe use of cotton cloth degradation to assess the improvement in soil health from differences induced by \nsoil management and crop rotation would be both possible and meaningful, based on the findings from \nthese CSA experiments. \n   \nFigure 12.1.

The Cotton Strip Assay (CSA) is a valuable tool that has been used \nover several decades as an ecological indicator. The assay is a simple assessment of the loss of cotton \nfibre strength as an indirect measure of soil microbial degradation of cellulose  in a standard strip of \ncotton cloth. Recent investigations have emphasised that CSA can be an effective indicator to describe \nmanagement effects on microbial activity, soil organic carbon or crop biomass in cotton fields \n(Nachimuthu et al., 2022). However, the need for an expensive tensometer precludes the greater uptake \nof this technique by researchers an d interested farmers. An earlier experiment compared the standard \nCSA measurement using a tensometer with a scanning technique (Nachimuthu et al., 2007) but scanning \nmethod was not adopted due its limitations. This report details an incubation experiment that compared \nthe CSA using a tensometer with a simple weight loss method, which could make the CSA more user-\nfriendly and more widely adopted.  \n2 Methods \nAn experiment was conducted using surface soils (0-10 cm) sampled from the long-term experiment as \ndescribed in Nachimuthu et al. (2018). Four of six cropping systems were examined in this experiment: \n(1c) maximum-tillage cotton-monoculture, (1d) maximum-tillage cotton-maize, (1e) minimum-tillage \ncotton-wheat, (1f) minimum-tillage cotton-wheat-maize. Each treatment was replicated 6 times with two \nstrips buried in each replicate (a total of 96 strips buried on day 0 in total). A total of 12 strips per \ntreatment with a cumulative total of 48 strips were extracted on day 15 and a similar number of strips \nwere extracted on day 25 after incubation. Altogether, a total of 96 strips were extracted and brushed \nfor soil particles and washed gently with deionised water and dried at 40 oC in a dehydrator overnight. \nThe dried strips were weighed (WS), then measured for tensile strength using a tensometer. The \ntensometer was calibrated using a digital tension balance. Every 10 mm movement of the counterbalance \nwas equal to 1 kg of extra weight. The control strips (unburied) were also broken on the tensometer as \na reference for determining loss of tensile strength (LTS) as below, \nLTS (%) = (kg to break control strip – kg to break sample strip) / kg to break control strip * 100 \nThe control strips were also washed and weighed (WC). Loss of weight (%) of cotton strips as a result \nof degradation was calculated as below, \nLoss of weight (%) = ((WC – WS) / WC) * 100 \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n151 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n \nStatistical analysis was carried out using Genstat Version 21.1.1.2 (VSN Internation al Ltd). Simple \nlinear regression was used to analyse the relationship between LTS% and loss of weight (%) for each \ntreatment. \n3 Results and discussion \nThe two CSA methods were positively correlated (Figure 13.1) with r2 ranging from 0.62 (15 day) and \n0.71 (25 day) averaged over four different cropping systems. The relationship was also significant for \nall four systems analysed individually ( P<0.001). The level of correlation between the two CSA \nmethods indicates that the weight loss method has the potential to be used for measuring microbial \nactivity in the Vertosols. The correlation on day 15 (Figure 13.1) and also analysing the data individually \nfor each cropping systems (Figure 13.2) suggest, the weight loss method may be inaccurate below 10% \nweightloss and needs further refinement. However, delaying the extraction of strips reduced the number \nof strips below 10% weight loss. The positive correlation between weightloss method and loss of tensile \nstrength across across maximum and minimum tillage systems und er different rotations suggest, \nweightloss method could be used under range of soil management and crop rotation systems. \n  \nFigure 13.1. Correlation (r2) between loss of tensile strength and loss of weight of cotton strips incubated \nin soils at 15 and 25 days after incubation. Measurements presented were from four different cropping \nsystems at each day of extraction. The solid line represents the linear regression and the circle dots \nrepresent the individual data points. \n \nAlthough the weight loss method showed a correlation with the tensometer method, further refinements \nof this method can be suggested. Washing the soil adhering to the strips before weighing is a delicate \njob and there is the potential to introduce a small error during this process. On some cotton strips, fine-\ncleaning the soil particles may prove a challenge and could slightly increase the weight if they are not \nremoved and introduce a minor error. However, the presence of any soil particles would not have \ncontributed to tensile stre ngth measurements. Careful brushing of the strips before washing could \nminimise the error. Other similar methods such as the tea bag index to measure organic matter \ndegradation have also reported minor errors (Mori, 2022). CSA using tensometers is also not without \nerrors. The tensile strength of cotton strips can be increased by fungi (Latter et al., 1988) . Therefore, \nboth the methods of CSA in this study using weight loss or tensometer quantification need  careful \npractice and attention to detail.  \nThe mechanical harvest of cotton crops often results in incomplete recovery of the lint produced \n(Faulkner et al., 2011), thus the microbial communities of cotton -producing soils are habituated to the \ny = 0.78x + 65.99\nR² = 0.62\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nLTS%\nLoss of weight (%)\nDay 15\ny = 0.58x + 72.56\nR² = 0.71\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nLTS%\nLoss of weight (%)\nDay 25\nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n152 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \ndecomposition of cellulose in the form of cotton fibres. Therefore, the CSA should be ideally suited to \ndetect changes in soil microbial activity as a result of soil management in cotton fields. CSA weight loss \ncan be adopted for measuring overall biological activity by cotton growers with a scope for further \nrefinement by scientists especially under less than 10% weight loss. In addition, the only visual indicator \nof soil biology currently recommended by the FAO, when assessing soil health, is the number of \nearthworms per square meter (Shepherd et al., 2008) . The current study, along with the recent study \n(Nachimuthu et al., 2022) in Australian cotton soils suggest that the CSA has excellent potential to be \ndeployed as a simpl e technique to monitor soil biological activity in warmer semi -arid environments \nwhere earthworms are rare and could be added to the recommended soil quality assessment methods. \n \n  \n  \n \nFigure 13.2.

Cotton Strip Assay (CSA) was a \nvaluable tool used over several years as an ecological indicator. This concept is a simple assessment of \nloss of cotton fibre strength  as an indirect measure of soil microbial degradation of cellulose in the \nstandard cotton cloth. However, whether this method is capable of predicting soil management \ndifferences within the cotton field was not investigated earlier. Several investigations were carried out \nthis summer at across multiple cotton valleys. Standard cotton cloths from a single standard fabric were \ncut to 6 cm x 6 cm and they were buried 5 cm below the soil surface and were excavated at periodical \nintervals in each trial. The excavated strips were rinsed with rain or deionised water and air dried. The \nair-dried strips were measured for tensile strength using a tensometer. The loss of tensile strength was \ncalculated by breaking unburied cotton strips and the results were expressed a s percentage (%) loss in \ntensile strength. Cotton Strip Assay provides metrics for comparison among management systems. \nComparison of cotton fields and native site were conducted for soil biology using.  \nThe on-farm cover crop experiment at Southern NSW suggests the loss of tensile strength as an indirect \nmeasure of microbial degradation was able to detect the differences between crop cover crop rotation \nsystems.  An investigation in an on-farm cover crop field trial at southern NSW (2020-2021 season) in \ncollaboration with CottonInfo indicates the loss of tensile strength is of the order Wheat>Barley>Control \n(Figure 14.1). This again emphasises not only the crop rotation benefits on soil biology but the ability \nof CSA to predict the soil microbial differences between management systems. \nThe results from Gwydir cotton valley indicate, there is no clear pattern in differences in the loss of \ntensile strength between native vegetation sites and cotton fields (Figure 14.2) and similar results were \nobserved in Darling Downs. The cotton strips assay conducted in Western Downs region of Queensland \nresulted in complete decomposition of strips in 4 weeks (Figure 14.3). The observed result is a function \nof soil moisture where the cotton fields are irrigated and native sites are not and the variability in rainfall \nacross different sites resulted in difference in microbial degradation of strips. Overall, the cotton growing \nsoil and native sites are biologically active. \nFigure 14.1.

The Cotton Strip Assay (CSA) is a valuable tool that indicates the rate of soil microbial \nactivity and has been used over several years in ecological studies. This assay is a simple measurement \nof the loss of cotton fibre strength which correlates with the level of microbial degradation of the \ncellulose within the standard cotton cloth used. Recent investigations demonstrated that CSA can be an \neffective indicator to assess the influence of agricult ural practices on microbial activity, soil organic \ncarbon or crop biomass in cotton fields (Nachimuthu et al., 2022). In the current study, the CSA was \nused to evaluate the effect of biochar and manure amendments on soil microbial activity in a commercial \ncotton-growing Vertosol (cracking clay soil) near Moree NSW. \n2 Methods \nThe experiments were conducted at ‘Keytah’ (29 o 281 E, 149o 351 S) in the Gwydir River valley near \nMoree, NSW. The experiment had a randomised block design with four manure rates and three biochar \nrate combinations resulting in 12 treatment combinations. However, for the purpose of this investigation \nusing CSA, only two manure (control and 15 t/ha of manure) and two biochar (control and 1000 kg/ha \nof biochar) combinations were studied, resulting in four treatment combinations as below \n1. Control  \n2. Biochar only (1000 kg/ha) \n3. Manure only (15 t/ha) \n4. Manure (15 t/ha) and Biochar (1000 kg/ha) \nEach treatment had four replicate plots arranged randomly within the trial area. Standard cotton cloths \nfrom a single standard fabric were cut to 6 cm x 6 cm strips, buried 5 cm below the soil surface (Figure \n15.1), then excavated after set time intervals. Fifteen strips were buried in each treatment plot and 3 \nstrips were excavated at each extraction time (2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after burial). The excavated strips \nwere rinsed with rain water or deionised water then air -dried. The air -dried strips were measured for \ntensile strength using a tensometer. The tensometer was calibrated using a digital tension balance \nwhereby every 10 mm movement of the counter balance was equal to 1 kg weight. Sever al unburied \nreference strips were also broken with results used in the formula for determining loss of tensile strength \n(LTS) as below, \nLTS (%) = (((kg to break reference strip) – (kg to break sample strip))/ kg to break reference strip) * \n100 \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n157 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \nStatistical analysis was carried out using Genstat Version 21.1.1.2 (VSN International Ltd) by treating \nthe experiment as a factorial design with manure and biochar as two factors. The treatment effects with \na probability of <5% were considered as significant effects. In such cases, the least significant difference \n(P < 0.05) was used to compare treatment means. \n  \nA) Cotton strips burial C) Tensometer with parts \n \n \nB) Cotton strips extraction D) Tensometer \nFigure 15.1.

This was mainly due to a lack of moisture as there was no irrigation or rainfall between \nburial and excavation in this time. However, after four weeks burial (with an incrop irrigation @1 ML \n/ha), the manure -treated soil showed the highest amount of microbial degradation (loss of tens ile \nstrength), with the combined manure and biochar treatment slightly less than this (Figure 15.2). \nAveraged across treatments, the biochar constrained the rate of cellulose degradation, while manure \nincreased the rate. The possible reason for this trend is, that the availability of manure as a nutrient \nsource for microbes might have resulted in a higher microbial population compared to the biochar which \nhad less nutritive content.  The negative impact of biochar was also observed after 6 weeks burial, \nalthough this trend was not statistically different as most strips were largely decomposed by this time. \nSimilarly, most strips were decomposed eight weeks after burial. \nThe negative impact of biochar on the degradation of cotton strips might indirectly indicate a decline in \nthe rate of breakdown of soil organic matter in the plots applied with biochar. However, this needs \nfurther investigation using a range of organic matter sources (eg. different crop stubbles), biochar \ncombinations and soil organic carbon m easurements. Soil organic carbon is reported to decline in the \ncotton farming systems of Australia (Hulugalle et al., 2013; Nachimuthu et al., 2018) . Identifying a \ncombination of biochar and crop stubble that mitigates soil organic carbon decline will assist growers \nwith their efforts to manage soil fertility in this challenging environment of Australia. \n \nFigure 15.2. Loss of tensile strength of cotton strips as influenced by treatments (4 weeks after burial) \n \n4 Conclusions \nBiochar negatively influenced the cotton strip degradation and manure enhanced the degradation of \ncotton strips. Future research on various combinations of biochar an d various crop stubbles in cotton -\ngrowing soils will inform the potential of possible crop stubble type -biochar combinations in reducing \nthe soil organic carbon decline in Australian cotton farming systems. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was undertaken as part  of DAN1801 funded by Cotton Research and Development \nCorporation and the NSW Department of Primary Industries.

In \nAustralia, the average cotton lint yield is higher than the world's average lint yield (CRDC and Cotton \nAustralia, 2020). However, there is still significant yield variability between regions, farms and fields. \nCotton fields within the same farm, despite having the same management and weather conditions, often \nvary considerably in yield, due to a diverse range of factors including: timing of oper ations, water \nsupply, soil constraints, climate, nutrition, pests, diseases, and weeds (Constable and Bange, 2015). Lint \nyield is impacted by both the individual factors listed above and their complex interactions. While long-\nterm experiments can improve the understanding of the causal factors for yield differences, the \nsignificant investment required in resources and time preclude replicating such research sites in multiple \nareas of the Australian industry. Modelling is an alternative approach that allows investigation of a range \nof climatic and growing condition scenarios, but the model first needs to be validated using actual field \ndata to maximise its predictive potential. \n2 Identifying yield performance zones within or between fields \nIn Australia, the cotton developed largely on highly fertile Vertosols (cracking clay soils) of New \nSouth Wales and Queensland but has since expanded onto other soil types and into other states (Northern \nTerritory and Western Australia). Recent NSW studies  indicate a decline in soil fertility (Nachimuthu \net al., 2022; Palmer et al., 2023)  which could create additional limitations for realising the yield \npotential. In addition, the new areas being developed often include soils that are less fertile than the \ntraditional cotton -growing areas or have some inherent soil chemical or physical properties that \nconstrain optimum crop prodution. Electromagnetic (EM) induction mapping is one approach to \nidentifying soil variability, although the resultant map needs to be ground -truthed with soil testing of \nthe various zones identified by the EM readings (Zare et al., 2020; Zare et al., 2021). Another approach \nis to integrate multiple years of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images to map long -\nterm high and low -yielding areas of paddocks. The latter approach has recently been developed as an \nonline tool (Constraint ID: Grains) for grain growers in Australia (Dang et al., 2021).  \nThere are limitations in using the NDVI maps to predict cotton lint yield as the direct relationship \nbetween NDVI and cotton lint yield is poor (Baio et al., 2018; Ballester et al., 2017). However, cotton \nis usually grown as one crop in a rotational cropping system (Hulugalle et al., 2017; Nachimuthu et al., \n2019; Rochester, 2011). The NDVI of rotation crops can be used to classify the field zones with different \nyield levels for cereal rotation crops using Constraint ID: Grains (Dang et al., 2021). The cotton yield \nmap is also a useful tool to identify the high and low-yielding zones within the cotton field (Filippi et \nal., 2022; Leo et al., 2021)  and can help to identify unmet yield potential (yield gap). The current \ncommercial service providers in the Australian cotton industry e.g., PCT AgCloud (PCT, 2023) and \nData farming (Datafarming, 2023) are capable of mapping variable yield zones within cotton fields. \nThough precision cropping techniques, such as variable -rate fertiliser or ameliorant applications, are \nsuggested as remedies to address the variabilities in the field, they need to be tested prior to broadscale \nuse to make sure the yield-inhibiting issue is actually being addressed. If the inputs are not matched t o \nthe problem, costly remedies may not improve yields and expenses will be wasted. Instead, a gradual \nstep by step approach is recommended to identify the yield constraints, address the issue and confirm \nthe response. A targeted ground -truthing exercise utilising soil testing is needed to base this approach \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n161 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \non and improve the understanding of soil constraints affecting cotton lint yield and its ameliorative \nmanagement. \n3 Limitation to address yield variability in cotton \nThe paired-field approach conducted in this project was limited to a single -year investigation as a \nresult of drought. However, it provided an opportunity to identify the soil properties that are potentially \nlimiting cotton lint yield (Chapter 1). The paired field approach works best if whole fields have uniform \nsoil characteristics, but the use of geo -located sampling points within fields also helps to assess the \nvariability in properties within each field. We accessed grower’s historical yield data for this study, but \nsome crop management reco rds were incomplete making it difficult to analyse long -term yield \ndifferences between closeby fields. Long-term benchmarking of cotton lint yield, crop management and \nseasonal stresses (biotic e.g. pest, disease, weeds and abiotic e.g. compaction) will assist with the efforts \nto understand the causes of yield variability. Soil moisture probes can also be a useful tool to understand \nthe crop water use pattern and relate it with environmental and biotic stresses. Similarly, canopy sensors \ncould provide time-series data on crop stress. However, there are practical limitations with the number \nof soil moisture probes or canopy sensors in Australian cotton fields due to the large field sizes and costs \ninvolved. As a result, growers and agronomists are usually lim ited to just a few probes or sensors for \neach field. Long -term benchmarking of yield with crop management must be accompanied by the \nappropriate tools and training for growers and advisors to capture and store the same parameters of on-\nfarm data every season.  \n4 Can strip trials be an option to identify and address the causal factors of yield \nvariability? \nFarmer-friendly approaches are needed to identify the factors causing yield variability and ways to \naddress them. A recent report on other cropping industries in Australia emphasised the need for ‘grower-\ncentric’ on-farm experimentation and it is becoming increasingly evident that digital tools and precision \nagriculture technologies are becoming the enablers of on-farm investigations (Bramley et al., 2022). In \ncotton systems, the yield map is a useful digital output that assists with identif ying the performance of \nthe field zones. An investigation using the grower machinery and associated tools or implements will \nbe more grower -centric and will assist with documenting useful information over the long term. The \nstrip trial approach proposed by Lawes and Bramley (2012) is notable and could be a good start for on-\nfarm investigations within cotton fields to identify the factors causing yield variability and address those \nconstraints. Growers, agronomists and researchers could adopt strip trials for ease of crop operations \nand possibly divide the strips into multiple zones (each zone as a plot or sampling or sensor point for \ninvestigation (Figure 16.1) based on their experience or with the supporting datasets such as yield maps, \nEM maps or Constra int ID etc. Multi -year and multi -location grower -driven strip trials with the \ninvolvement of researchers to document the key data will build the dataset required to interpret and \nimprove the understanding of yield variability. Building a dataset is the fir st key step in addressing \nvariability. However, the d evelopment of a centrally- managed database (e.g. CRDC or CSD or a \ncommon cotton industry body similar to GRDC’s Better Fertiliser Decision for Cropping (BFDC) or \ngrains on-farm trial database (https://www.farmtrials.com.au/) or Soil CRC’s Visualising  Australasia’s \nsoils database ( https://data.soilcrc.com.au/map/about)) could enable the data capture from all the on -\nfarm trials and support the efforts to understand and address the cotton yield variability. The data needs \nto be screened to make sure it followed proper quality assurance protocols and has enough supporting \nmeta-data for it to be useful for future interpretation. Such effort should be accompanied by ongoing \nmaintenance of the database. \n \n \n \nMinimising yield variability to maximise yield in a cotton \n162 | NSW Department of Primary Industries, July 2024 \n5 Future research \nFuture research needs to focus on on-farm experiments to identify and address the constraints for yield \nvariability using grower centric strip trial approach. The strip trial approach could encompass but is not \nlimited to \n1. Identifying the causes of yield variability (soil properties, disease incidence) \n2. Single strip amendments (e.g compost, gypsum etc) or fertilisers to address constraints \n3. Single-strip foliar sprays of growth regulators or nutrients (growth and/or yield response study) \n4.

Control of SLW still relies heavily on the use of insecticides, \nalthough biological control, including conserving natural populations and augmentation via \nparasitoid wasp releases, has been adopted by some growers. \nSilverleaf whitefly resistance to pyriproxyfen emerged as a significant issue during the 2016/17 \nseason. The industry responded by introducing a 30-day application ‘spray’ window to restrict \npyriproxyfen use, aiming to reduce resistance selection pressure. From 2018 to 2020 this \napproach showed promise with a steady decline in the number of populations carrying \nresistance. However, in 2021 and 2022 close to half of the tested populations contained some \nresistant individuals. While the severity of resistance is lower than that observed in 2016/17, it is \nstill a concerning reversal of the earlier trajectory. \nWithin the cotton industry, detection of SLW resistance to spirotetramat was first documented in \nEmerald in 2019. During the last three seasons, spirotetramat resistance was detected in \npopulations collected from cotton in Emerald, Theodore, Darling Downs, Mungindi, and \nMacintyre and Namoi valleys. DNA sequencing of populations collected between 2019 and 2021 \nfound the frequency of the mutation in resistant populations was low (1.2-4.1%). While current \nresistance levels are unlikely to cause management issues, SLW resistance to spirotetramat has \nthe potential to increase (as already observed in other industries). A proactive change to the \nInsecticide resistance management strategy (IRMS) was made in 2019, reducing spirotetramat \nuse to a single spray per field for SLW control. \n \n \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  5 of 40 \nA change in registration that occurred in 2020 now means buprofezin can be used in cotton for \nSLW control. Testing by bioassay has found no evidence of SLW resistance to buprofezin. Testing \nof laboratory strains with known resistance to pyriproxyfen and spirotetramat showed no signs \nof cross resistance to buprofezin. At the time of its inclusion in the IRMS, buprofezin was \nrestricted to a single application when targeting SLW. \nWidespread SLW resistance to imidacloprid and pymetrozine was found during testing in 2020. \nThese results from 2020 and testing of laboratory neonicotinoid-resistant strain against a range \nof neonicotinoids show there is low-level cross resistance between imidacloprid and acetamiprid \nbut no cross resistance to dinotefuran. Testing from 2020 to 2022 showed no definitive evidence \nof resistance to either acetamiprid or dinotefuran. \nResistance to the pyrethroid bifenthrin has been detected in many of the tested SLW populations \nover the past three years. This data, along with DNA sequencing data was recently published \n(Pest management Science, 78 – issue 8, August 2022,). Resistance to bifenthrin is widespread in \ncotton production regions, but within a population the mutation’s frequency is generally low (1-\n7%). In the same study, we documented that Bemisia tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (formerly B-\nbiotype) is the dominant species found in cotton grown in NSW and QLD. The potentially invasive \nB. tabaci Mediterranean (formerly Q-biotype) was not detected in any of the samples. \nExtension of project findings was circulated primarily via annual updates in the Australian \ncottongrower, via CottonInfo factsheets and by CottonInfo’s regional extension officers (REOs). \nExtension of SLW parasitism was achieved by engaging REOs in an in-field assessment of \nparasitism levels. The REOs gained firsthand experience and increased recognition of the value of \nbiological control from parasitism during the exercise, which has been shared at a local level with \nagronomists. \nIntroduction \nThe cotton insect pest Bemisia tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1), commonly known as \nsilverleaf whitefly (SLW) is widely distributed in Australia. B. tabaci MEAM1 is an invasive pest that \nwas first detected in Australia in 1994. It is part of a species complex (morphologically \nindistinguishable species), that could make the arrival of other invasive species like B. tabaci \nMediterranean (MED) difficult to detect. Globally, B. tabaci MEAM1 is a vector of several \nimportant viruses of economic plants including cotton leaf curl disease.  \nIn Australian cotton, SLW are primarily a pest due to their potential to contaminate cotton lint \nwith honeydew, leading to reduced quality. High levels of stickiness incur significant price \ndiscounts and can lead to rejection by the buyer. Honeydew present on cotton lint also attracts \nthe growth of sooty mould, which discolours lint. Cotton is graded on colour, with small \npremiums paid for good grades, but there can be significant discounts for poor grades. \nInsecticide resistance in SLW is well documented. It makes management more difficult and has \nthe potential to increase the cost of control. While several insecticides are registered for SLW \ncontrol, in reality only a select few are widely used due to concerns regarding efficacy, \ndetrimental impact on natural enemies, or potential of field failure due to resistance. \nTo manage the risk of resistance, SLW are included in the industry’s insecticide resistance \nmanagement strategy (IRMS). The strategy uses a combination of product windows and use \nrestrictions to minimise the selection of resistance in pest populations. As insect populations can \nrapidly evolve resistance, this project collected annual data on the resistance status of SLW \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  6 of 40 \nobtained from several major cotton production regions. Based on observed changes in resistance \nlevels, the data is used to update the IRMS and maintain its effectiveness. \nThe project also conducted biosecurity surveillance of the B. tabaci species complex present in \ncotton. Invasive whitefly, particularly, B. tabaci MED pose a significant biosecurity threat to \nAustralia’s cotton industry. Further incursions of B. tabaci have the potential to introduce new \nforms of resistance or diseases, like cotton leaf curl. \nBiological control of silverleaf whitefly due to predation and parasitism is an important \ncomponent of population suppression. This includes the activity of the parasitoid Eretmocerus \nhayati, which often goes unnoticed due to their minute size. To extend the skill of identifying \nparasitised whitefly nymphs this project collaborated with CottonInfo regional extension officers \nto share knowledge that could be disseminated to growers and agronomists in their respective \nregions. \nMaterials and methods \nBiosecurity surveillance  \nTo determine the species composition of whitefly present in Australian cotton, annual \nsurveillance was completed across a number of cotton production regions. Surveyed regions \nincluded Emerald, Theodore, Darling Downs, St George, Mungindi, Goondiwindi, Moree, Narrabri, \nWarren, Hillston, and Griffith. From these collections, adult whiteflies were preserved in 90% \nethanol and stored at -20°C. Preserved insect samples were sent to CSIRO for DNA extraction and \nsequencing. \nDNA was extracted from the whitefly using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit following \nthe manufacturer’s instructions. Amplicons were generated using modified gene-specific \nprimers, attached to Illumina linker sequences (Fang et al., 2022). The mtCOI barcoding region \nwas amplified using Wfly-PCR-F1/RI and Wfly-PCR-F2/R2 primers (Table 1). All PCRs were \nperformed using Platinum Taq and mtCOI gene sequences were amplified as described in Tay et \nal. (2022). Sanger sequencing was used for smaller sample sizes (n<30), while for larger \npopulations (n>30) metabarcoding and high throughput sequencing was used for pooled \nwhitefly samples. \nAll amplicon sequencing analysis was completed using CLC Genomics Workbench V21.o. Fastq \nfiles were imported as joint-paired-end reads and quality trimmed with 0.05 quality scores. \nTrimmed mtCOI reads were mapped to the updated B. tabaci mtCOI database (Kunz et al., 2019). \nTable 1.

Adult whiteflies were collected \nfrom commercial fields using a handheld vacuum (Stihl BG75) and from these collections, discrete \npopulations were established and maintained under glasshouse conditions. Additionally, a small \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  7 of 40 \nnumber of populations were established from leaf collections sent to laboratory by agronomists \nand cottoninfo regional extension officers. \nCotton variety, Sicot 714B3RF (without insecticide seed treatment) was used for all insect rearing \nand insecticide bioassays. Plants were grown in small pots with potting mix. For the initial 3-4 \nweeks of growth, plants were reared under artificial light in a controlled environment (CE) room \n(29°C; 70% RH; 16L:8D). Once plants had reached between 4 and 6 true leaves, they were \ntransferred from the CE room to a glasshouse where they were kept in large insect-proof cages \nfor a further 3-4 weeks of growth. To minimise pest mite, aphid and thrips populations in the \nglasshouse, plants were kept for no longer than 8 weeks. \nBioassays \nSilverleaf whitefly populations were tested for the presence of resistance to insecticides \ncurrently registered for their control. The life stage of whitefly tested in the assay was \ndetermined by the mode of action of the insecticide tested and assays were either systemic \nuptake or foliar leaf dip (Hopkinson et al., 2020; Hopkinson and Pumpa, 2019). \nEgg assay – pyriproxyfen \nThe bioassay for the presence of pyriproxyfen resistance tested egg mortality and used a foliar \nleaf dip. A dosage range of 0.001 to 10 mg/L was used with the discriminating dose set at 10 mg/L, \nto distinguish between susceptible and resistant populations. A typical assay had 6 treatments, a \ncontrol of diluent only (100 mg/L Agral), with 30–50 individuals per experimental unit and was \nreplicated 5 times. An assessment of egg mortality was made at 10 days after treatment by \ncounting both eggs that failed to hatch and nymphs that died during emergence. \nEgg/nymph assay – cyantraniliprole \nA systemic uptake assay was used to test the susceptibility of whitefly to cyantraniliprole. A \ndosage range of 0.01 to 1 mg/L was used with 5 treatment doses and a control of diluent only \n(distilled water). Assays were replicated 5 times with 30 insects per experimental unit. Uptake of \ncyantraniliprole was via the leaf petiole and treatment commenced 1 day after egg lay, with an \nassessment of mortality made on early instar nymphs at 14 days after treatment. A discriminating \ndose for cyantraniliprole was set at 1 mg/L. \nNymph assay – spirotetramat and buprofezin \nA foliar leaf dip assay targeting 1st and 2nd instar nymphs was used to test the susceptibility of \nwhitefly populations to spirotetramat and buprofezin. For spirotetramat the dosage range was 1 \nto 100 mg/L with 5 treatment doses, while for buprofezin a dosage range of 0.1 to 32 mg/L was \nused with 6 treatment doses. Both assays included a control of diluent only (100 mg/L Agral) and \nwere replicated 5 times with 25-30 insects per experimental unit. For spirotetramat, the \ndiscriminating dose was set at 100 mg/L, while for buprofezin the discriminating dose is still to be \ndetermined, most likely it will be 200 mg/L. \nAdult assay \nFor the remaining insecticides an adult assay was used to test the susceptibility of whitefly (Table \n2). Each assay had 5 replicates and depending on insecticide, 5 to 7 treatment doses were tested \nand a control of diluent only was included. For adult assays, 20 to 25 insects are tested per \nexperimental unit. In most cases these assays were foliar (leaf dip assays). Imidacloprid was \ntested using a systemic uptake, while flupyradifurone was tested using both foliar and systemic \nuptake. \nData analysis \nNon-pooled bioassay data were analysed by probit (Genstat 19th edition). From this analysis lethal \nconcentration estimates (LC50 – LC99.9) and their 95% fiducical limits were calculated. For each \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  8 of 40 \nassay, the lowest dose that killed 100% of tested insects; known as the minimum effective \nconcentration (MEC) was recorded. For each population, a resistance ratio (RR) was derived by \ndividing the calculated LC50 of the field collected populations by the value of a reference \nsusceptible population (SU07-1). \nTable 2.

If leaves were heavily infested, a representative section of leaf was used. Data was \nentered into Excel and the percentage of parasitised nymphs was calculated. Cloud-based \nstorage was used to store images within the group, enabling shared learning. Features in the \nnymph photos could be highlighted to help learn the major diagnostic features used to identify \nwhitefly parasitism. \nReview of molecular-based detection of insecticide resistance in silverleaf whitefly \nLiterature review \nAcademic literature covering molecular-based studies of insecticide resistance relevant to B. \ntabaci and insecticides currently registered for its management were reviewed to gain a better \nunderstanding of how genotyping could be incorporated into current and future projects. \nLiterature searches were conducted from 2019 to 2022 using Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of \nScience and Google Scholar. \nDNA sequencing  \nPopulations of B. tabaci collected between 2013 and 2021 were sub-sampled into ethanol. DNA \nwas extracted and sequenced for the presence of known resistance mutations for \norganophospates (F331W), pyrethroids (L925I). For the mutations A2083V and A2151V linked to \nspirotetramat, the same process was repeated but restricted to samples collected between 2017 \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  9 of 40 \nand 2021. Sequencing data for pyrethroid and spirotetramat were compared to phenotypic data \nfrom bioassays. Full methodology of the organophosphate and pyrethroid study is published in \n(Fang et al., 2022), while the spirotetramat study is currently in preparation for publication, but \nLeuke et al. (2020) contains an earlier description of the methodology. \nResults \nBiosecurity surveillance  \nWhitefly collected between 2013 and 2021 primarily from 11 cotton production regions were \nidentified to species level. From 144 field populations only two had a mixed species complex of \nAUS I and MEAM1; the remaining 142 populations consisted of MEAM1 only. The potentially \ninvasive B. tabaci MED (formerly Q – biotype) was not detected, nor was ASIA II that has recently \nbeen reported as present in Australia (Wongnikong et al., 2021). The two populations with mixed \nAUS1 and MEAM1 were collected from Goondiwindi in 2016 (19.6% AUS I) and 2017 (7.9% AUS I). \nOver the past three years some populations were started from only a small field population \n(Narromine 2020), or failed to establish: \n Macintyre (1) 2021 failed to establish after collection \n Macintyre (4) 2021 slow to establish, only tested with pyriproxyfen \n Moree (1) 2022 failed to establish, very slow development time \n Moree (2) 2022 failed to establish, very slow development time \n \nResistance monitoring for silverleaf whitefly \nBioassays, that test the phenotypic response of field collected populations were completed for \neach of the insecticides registered for whitefly management. For some registered insecticides, \ntesting was reduced, reflecting their limited use in cotton. For insecticides where discriminating \ndoses have been developed, they were used to identify resistant populations. In the absence of a \ndefined discriminating dose, resistance ratios were used to infer resistance. Resistance ratios \nrepresent the difference between a field population and a lab susceptible strain (LC50 of field \npopulation/LC50 of susceptible strain). The level of resistance is classified as; susceptibility (RR=1), \ntolerance to low resistance (RR = 2–10), moderate resistance (RR = 11–30), high resistance (RR = \n31–100), very high resistance (RR > 100).  In the absence of supporting evidence, low level \nresistance is difficult to infer from resistance ratios. \n3A – Pyrethroids  \nBifenthrin \nBased on survival at a discriminating dose of 320 mg/L, resistance to bifenthrin was frequently \ndetected in many of the populations tested (Table 3). While resistance is widespread, the \nfrequency of the vgsc mutation L925I within the resistant populations from cotton production is \nlow (1.1-4.7%). The resistance ratios calculated from the bioassay data are low, which is consistent \nwith the molecular findings and suggests the target site mutation is the primary source of \nresistance in the tested populations. \nTable 3.

Cross-resistance within the \nneonicotinoid group and between neonicotinoids and pymetrozine is known to occur (Elbert and \nNauen, 2000; Nauen et al., 2013) and for this reason field-collected populations in 2020 were \ntested to determine levels of resistance to imidacloprid and pymetrozine. To further investigate \ncross-resistance, the response of lab-resistant strain (GR15-1R) to several neonicotinoids was \ndetermined using both foliar and systemic uptake assays. Field populations were tested for \nresistance to the registered insecticides acetamiprid and dinotefuran. \nImidacloprid \nResults from the systemic bioassays conducted in 2020 indicate that most field-collected \npopulations tested were resistant to imidacloprid (Table 4). As a discriminating dose has not \nbeen developed locally, this is based off survival at 30mg/L, which effectively controls the lab-\nsusceptible strain; 16 mg/L has been used internationally (Cahill et al., 1996). Combined with the \nresistance ratios this indicates that populations from Emerald, Darling Downs, St George, \nMacintyre, North Star, Moree, and Namoi Valley have resistance to imidacloprid. \nTable 4.

The results demonstrated that GR15-1R \nhas high to very high resistance to thiacloprid, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin. \nExcept for thiamethoxam (79%), mortality in the above assays was <50% at 1000 mg/L. The \nacetamiprid assay did achieve 100% mortality at 1000 mg/L, while at 320 mg/L mortality was \n98.9%. The resistance ratio was 11.4; suggesting low level cross-resistance to acetamiprid. In the \ndinotefuran assay 100% mortality was recorded at 320 mg/L, indicating there was no cross \nresistance to dinotefuran.  \nThe systemic results showed a significant increase in the sensitivity of GR15-1R to neonicotinoids \n(Table 7). The bioassays showed resistance to imidacloprid and clothianidin, with neither assay \nreaching 100% mortality at 100 mg/L and resistance ratios were >10. The thiamethoxam assay \nindicated the presence of low level cross-resistance, while for the other neonicotinoids \n(thiacloprid, acetamiprid & dinotefuran) there was limited evidence of cross resistance. \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  12 of 40 \nThe conclusion from this study is whitefly that are resistant to imidacloprid and clothianidin have \nlow cross resistance to acetamiprid, but no cross resistance dinotefuran.

It cannot be applied by \naircraft and to date has not been registered for use in cotton. However, given it’s a new mode of \naction in Australia it was considered prudent to determine the baseline susceptibility of silverleaf \nwhitefly to flupyradifurone to make it easier to detect resistance should it evolve, and further \ntesting be required. \nBoth foliar and systemic uptake bioassays were evaluated, with both performing adequately. As \nexpected, the systemic assay had greater sensitivity, and 100% mortality was achieved in each \nassay (Table 10). In the foliar assay, three populations, Emerald, Macintyre (2), and Griffith did not \nreach 100% mortality at the highest dose of 100 mg/L, with mortalities of 95.8, 97.0 and 99.0% \nrespectively (Table 11). The LC99 of the lab susceptible population was 54.6, while for field-\ncollected populations the average LC99was 256.87. This suggests the addition of 300 mg/L is \nrequired to complete the dosage range for the foliar assay. Due to the limited testing and \nvariability in response a discriminating dose was not determined for the foliar assay.  \nIn the systemic assay, the LC99 of the susceptible was 2.30 and the LC99.9 was 5.21. The average \nresponse of the field collected populations were an LC99 of 4.9 and an LC99.9 of 12.3. The Griffith \npopulation had the highest recorded LC99.9 at 23.99.

Afidopyropen is \nregistered in cotton for suppression of silverleaf whitefly. Application of afidopyropen is \nrestricted; it cannot be applied by aircraft, limiting its adoption for use against whitefly in cotton. \nA foliar assay was used to evaluate the susceptibility of field-collected populations to \nafidopyropen. The tested populations had decreased sensitivity compared to the lab susceptible \nstrain, but not significant enough (RR = 0.9 to 5.9, MEC ≤100 mg/L) to suggest existing resistance \nto this mode of action. The dose response of the 2020 populations, particularly from Bowen \nwould indicate no apparent cross-resistance to pymetrozine (9B), a similar finding to Zhang et al. \n(2021).  \nDose responses observed in afidopyropen bioassays were often highly variable between \nreplicates, and in some assays 100% mortality was not achieved within the dose range, which \nmeant in some cases assays needed to be repeated. This observation is likely linked to the mode \nof action of group 9 insecticide (chordotonal organ TRPV channel modulators) which indirectly \nkills sucking pests by inhibiting feeding, leading to starvation and eventual death (Zhang et al., \n2021). \nA discriminating dose of 300 mg/L was determined from the dose response of 37 populations \ntested between 2019 and 2020. It was set using the parameters of highest LC99 value recorded, \n229.3 (104.6-880.8) and the highest recorded minimum effective concentration of 100 mg/L.  \nTable 14.

Three main enzyme families are implicated in \ndetoxification: esterases, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P450 \nmonooxygenases (P450s) (Bass and Field, 2011).  \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  24 of 40 \nModified target site resistance is where the site that the toxin binds to in the insect has changed \nvia a genetic mutation and is now less sensitive to the toxin. In some cases, target site \ninsensitivity is enhanced by duplication of the genes that encode target-site proteins, reducing \nthe fitness costs associated with homozygous resistance (Bass and Field, 2011). \nBioassays \nDetection of insecticide resistance in pest insects has traditionally relied on the use of bioassays \nthat determine the phenotypic response of a population of insects to the toxin. Bioassays can \neither use a range of doses (concentration gradient) or diagnostic dose(s). Bioassays that use a \nrange of doses can be used to determine the resistance ratio of tested populations. By \ncalculating LC50 values and/or minimum effective concentrations (MEC), resistant populations can \nbe separated from susceptible reference populations, thereby confirming the occurrence of \nresistance and allowing a comparison of the ‘strength’ of resistance between populations. \nDiagnostic or discriminating dose assays can be used to detect resistant populations across a \nwider geographic range and thereby estimate the frequency of resistant populations within the \noverall pest distribution.   \nBiochemical assays can be used to both characterise resistance mechanisms and detect \nresistance where the mechanism for resistance has been elucidated. Biochemical assays can be \nused to reveal differences related to the pesticide target (target site resistance) or to pesticide \nneutralisation (non-target site resistance) (R4P Network, 2016). However, most enzyme or \nprotein assays require the specific pest organs, tissues or subcellular fractions to be analysed, \nnecessitating their careful dissection or preparation prior to testing. For example, a prototype \nfield-based diagnostic lateral flow assay has been developed for whitefly to screen for \noverexpression of CYP6CM1 (Nauen et al., 2015). This assay has the potential to be used for quick \nin-field monitoring of resistance. \nMolecular screening, and identified mechanisms \nWhere the mechanism(s) that confer resistance have been discovered, the potential to replace \nbioassays with molecular screening is an alternative method for screening populations for the \npresence of resistance. \nIn the case of metabolic resistance, the molecular method for detecting resistance requires the \nextraction of RNA from a pools of insects ~100 whitefly adults. First strand cDNA is synthesized \nby using a primer and reverse transcription kit. The levels of the enzyme (e.g. cytochrome P450) \nis measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification (Real-Time PCR Detection System) \n(Kapantaidaki et al., 2018). \nTo detect the presence of modified target site resistance, Genomic DNA is extracted. PCR \namplification of a diagnostic fragment of DNA using primers is used which can be visualised using \ngel electrophoresis or sequenced. \n1A Organophosphates/ 1B carbamates \nBemisia tabaci resistant to organophosphates have been shown to carry the amino acid change \nphenylaline (F) to tryptophan (W) in the acetylcholinesterase enzyme ace1 (i.e. the F331W \nmutation). This mutation of the amino acid results in acetyl choline esterase (AChE) target site \ninsensitivity. The F331W mutation can be detected using PCR-RFLP (Tsagkarakou et al., 2009). \nMetabolic resistance may also play a role in organophosphate (OP) resistance. The \ncarboxylesterase gene coe1 in B. tabaci was found to be overexpressed (approx. 4 fold) in an OP-\nresistant strain and was demonstrated by quantitative PCR that the elevated expression is not \nrelated to gene amplification, but possibly due to modified transcriptional control (Alon et al., \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  25 of 40 \n2008). AChE target site insensitivity and increased esterase activity confers resistance to \ncarbamates as well, i.e. cross resistance between OPs and carbamates (Byrne and Devonshire, \n1993). \n3A Pyrethroids \nIn Bemisia tabaci the L925I pyrethroid resistance mutation in the para-type voltage gated sodium \nchannel (vgsc) can be used to separate resistant and susceptible populations using PCR-RFLP \n(Tsagkarakou et al., 2009). Another mutation (T929V) does not create or disrupt a restriction site, \nhowever the double nucleotide substitutions (ACT or CTT) can be used to design an allelic specific \n(PASA) assay (Tsagkarakou et al., 2009). In B. tabaci MED resistant strain (GRMAL-RP) from Crete, \nmetabolic resistance has been reported with cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase and \ncarboxylesterase activity elevated, while glutathione-S-transferase activity was not different. This \nstrain carried the L925I and T929V mutations of the para sodium channel gene (Roditakis et al., \n2006). \n4A Neonicotinoids/9B Pymetrozine \nThe B. tabaci cytochrome P450 CYP6CM1 is often found to be over-expressed in populations with \nimidacloprid resistance (Bass et al., 2015; Karunker et al., 2008). However, there can be \npopulations with high resistance ratios that are not strongly correlated with CYP6CM1 expression \nlevel, indicative of additional neonicotinoid resistance mechanisms being present in those \npopulations (Ilias et al., 2015). To detect metabolic resistance RNA sequencing is required. \nKarunker et al. (2008) used quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) to investigate the \ncorrelation between imidacloprid resistance and the expression level of P450 genes in MED and \nMEAM1 B. tabaci. A TaqMan® gene expression assay (Jones et al., 2011) can be used to routinely \nmonitor for resistance based on the expression levels of CYP6CM1. \nClothianidin and thiacloprid are two other neonicotinoid metabolized by CYP6CM1, while \nacetamiprid and thiamethoxam are not (Roditakis et al., 2011). Recently it was demonstrated \ndinotefuran is another neonicotinoid where resistance isn’t linked to over-expression of \nCYP6CM1, as shown by a lack of metabolism of dinotefuran by CYP6CM1 derivatives (Hamada et \nal., 2019). \nTarget site resistance to neonicotinoids has been detected in at least two hemipteran species: \ngreen peach aphid, Myzus persicae and the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Crossthwaite \net al., 2014). \nThe anti-feedant pymetrozine, which is structurally and functionally unrelated to the \nneonicotinoid group, shares cross-resistance to imidacloprid via the same detoxification \nmechanism linked to the over-expression of CYP6CM1 (Nauen et al., 2013). \n6 Emamectin benzoate \nThe efficacy of emamectin benzoate against B. tabaci has been studied infrequently (Ahmad and \nAkhtar, 2018; Ishaaya et al., 2002); as a result, there is no information about potential resistance \nmechanisms. Elsewhere, resistance mechanisms to emamectin benzoate (EMB) have been best \nstudied in sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis, which are ectoparasitic copepods of salmon (Poley et \nal., 2015). Candidate resistance genes were studied, with resistant lice showing significant over-\nexpression of nAChRα7 and down-regulation of nAChRα3 (neuronal acetylcholine receptor \nsubunits). A novel gene candidate LR9 (leukocyte receptor) showed induced expression upon \nEMB exposure in the resistant males (males are more resistant than females). Other gene \ncandidates like CYP18A1 and peroxinectin did not show similar expression profiles to studies \ncompleted on other sea lice populations (Carmichael et al., 2013; Núñez-Acuña and Gallardo-\nEscárate, 2015). One study that investigated synergism of enzyme inhibitors in B. tabaci found an \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  26 of 40 \nincrease in sensitivity to EMB (5-fold resistant) in field populations when the synergist piperonyl \nbutoxide (inhibitor of AChE activity) was added (Kang et al., 2006). Triphenyl phosphate \nincreased the sensitivity of the field population to a lesser extent, while diethyl maleate did not \nsignificantly change the sensitivity of the field population to EMB. \n7C Pyriproxyfen \nResistance to pyriproxyfen has been linked to metabolic detoxification, specifically the enzyme \nactivity of P450s and GSTs (Ma et al., 2010). In B. tabaci MED after an application of pyriproxyfen \nto a resistant strain, a cDNA microarray was used to monitor changes in gene expression. In total \n111 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified that were differentially upregulated after \npyriproxyfen treatment. Of those one, cytochrome P450 CYP9F2 gene was induced 3.85-fold and \nis likely candidate in insecticide detoxification (Ghanim and Kontsedalov, 2007). In Trialeurodes \nvaporariorum (greenhouse whitefly) the cytochrome P450 gene CYP4G61 has been identified as a \nstrong candidate associated with the resistant phenotype (Karatolos et al., 2012). \n9D Afidopyropen \nAfidopyropen is similar to pymetrozine (Kandasamy et al., 2017); both belong to group 9, \nchordotonal organ TRPV channel modulators. As stated above in the section on neonicotinoids, \nover-expression of CYP6CM1 is known to confer resistance to pymetrozine. At this time, it is not \nknown if over-expression of CYP6CM1 results in detoxification of afidopyropen. \n12A Diafenthiuron \nMetabolic detoxification was investigated in a lab population of B. tabaci MEAM1 that was \nselected for diafenthiuron resistance in the lab (over 36 generations) with 33-fold resistance \n(Zhang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). This research found detoxification genes GST, CYP6CX4, \nCYP6DW3, CYP6DZ6 and CYP9F were constitutively over-expressed in the resistant (R-DfWf) \nstrain and upregulated following exposure to diafenthiuron. Another detoxification gene \nCYP6CX1 was not upregulated, and COE1, CYP6CM1 and CYP6A (which were not constitutively \noverexpressed in the resistant strain) were upregulated following exposure to diafenthiuron. \nWhether the type of resistance selected in the lab will occur under field conditions remains to be \ndetermined. Lab-selected resistance can often be different to the rare mutations that are \nselected under field exposure to insecticides and should only be used as a guide to potential \nmutations.  \n16 Buprofezin \nBuprofezin (Group 16) is an inhibitor of chitin biosynthesis in hemipterans and shares the same \nmode of action as other insecticides including the benzoylureas (BPUs) (Group 15) and etoxazole \n(Group 10B) (Douris et al., 2016). A mutation (I1042M) in the chitin synthase (CHS1) gene of BPU \nresistant Plutella xylostella was discovered at the same position as the I1017F mutation reported \nin spider mites that confers etoxazole resistance (Douris et al., 2016). Using a genome-editing \nCRISPR/Cas9 approach coupled with homology-directed repair in Drosophila melanogaster both \nsubstitutions (I1056M/F) in the corresponding fly CHS1 gene (kkv) were introduced. Homozygous \nlines bearing either of these mutations were highly resistant to etoxazole and all BPUs as well as \nbuprofezin.  \n23 Spirotetramat  \nResistance to group 23 insecticides (spirodiclofen, spiromesifen and spirotetramat) has been \nreported in spider mites, Tetranychus urticae, cotton aphid Aphis gossypii and whitefly B. tabaci.  \nGroup 23 insecticides are lipid biosynthesis inhibitors targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)—an \nenzyme known to catalyze the rate limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Resistance to \nspirotetramat has been reported in both Spain in B. tabaci MED and in Australia in B. tabaci \nMEAM1 (Bielza et al., 2019; Lueke et al., 2020). A recent study has shown that an ACC variant \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  27 of 40 \nbearing a mutation (A2083V) results in an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved region of \nthe carboxyltransferase (CT) domain (Lueke et al., 2020). Contribution of the mutation to \nresistance was confirmed using CRSIPR/Cas9 genome modified Drosophila in toxicity assays \n(Lueke et al., 2020). A pyrosequencing-based diagnostic assay was used to map the spread of \nresistance alleles in field-collected samples from Spain (Lueke et al., 2020). Recently a Droplet \nDigital PCR (ddPCR) assay was developed to detect the A2083V mutation in B. tabaci (Mavridis et \nal., 2022). \n28 Cyantraniliprole \nCyantraniliprole belongs to the group of insecticide known as diamides, which includes other \ninsecticides like chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide. These insecticides target insect ryanodine \nreceptors (RyR), which are calcium release channels that are important in calcium homeostasis in \nnumerous cell types. Bemisia tabaci (MED) resistance to cyantraniliprole has been reported in \nChina (Wang et al., 2018). A resistant strain CYAN-R (with a RR of 63), was created via repeated \nbackcrossing of the field resistant strain with a susceptible strain. This strain was tested for \noverexpression of known detoxification related P450 genes, but no significant change in \nexpression levels was detected (Wang et al., 2020). In both studies an adult assay was used in \nplace of the more commonly used nymph-based assay, so it’s not possible to directly compare \ndata with our bioassay results. Resistance to diamide insecticides is better understood in \ndiamond back moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. Bioassays of resistant and susceptible DBM \ndemonstrated the resistant population had >1000-fold resistance to both chlorantraniliprole and \nflubendiamide. Gene sequencing of the proposed diamide binding site of RyR from DBM \n(resistant from Philippines and Thailand, as well as susceptible strains) were amplified by RT-PCR \nand sequenced. Comparison of the sequence with susceptible stains revealed non-synonymous \nmutations in each of the resistant strains that in both cases lead to a glycine to glutamic acid \nsubstitution (G4946E) in the protein. A pyrosequencing-based diagnostic assay was developed \nfor resistance monitoring purposes (Troczka et al., 2012). Metabolic mechanisms of resistance \nhave also been proposed, but at this time the research is not conclusive (Troczka et al., 2017). \nConfirming mechanisms \nAs mentioned in the section above covering spirotetramat resistance, gene editing (CRISPR/cas9) \ncan be used to create Drosophila strains bearing mutations linked to insecticide resistance. This \nhas so far been used to look at target genes linked to several insecticides including imidacloprid, \nspinosad, and pyrethroids (Douris et al., 2020). Another method using germ-line transformation \n(Bischof et al., 2007) has been used to modify Drosophila to express pest insect genes, including a \ncarboxylesterase gene (αE7), gluthathione S-transferase gene (GstE2) and a cytochrome P450 \ngene (Cyp6cm1). Bioassays of these transgenic Drosophila confirmed the linkage between these \ncandidate genes to resistance to OPs (diazinon and malathion), DDT and imidacloprid, \nrespectively (Daborn et al., 2012). \nConsiderations when using molecular based resistance monitoring \nThe potential advantage of using molecular screening is higher throughput, fast and accurate \ndiagnostics. Hopefully increasing the capability to detect resistance early, prior to significant \nselection, will allow the deployment of effective resistance management strategies. \nThe relative strength of and diagnostic value of molecular markers is influenced by the following \nfactors (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020): \n Geographical distribution of the marker (on what scale do resistance mechanisms vary?), i.e. \nis a marker described elsewhere, is the cause of resistance local or has another mechanism \nevolved? \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  28 of 40 \n Intensity of underlying resistance phenotype associated with the marker (i.e. how much is \nthe phenotype determined by a single marker?). This has been well studied in T. urticae (see \n(Van Leeuwen et al., 2020) but is less well understood in other pest species. \n Predictive value of the marker for cross-spectrum resistance.  \n Epistasis (the effect of a gene mutation is dependent on the presence/absence of mutations \nin one or more other genes) and how many resistance markers are required for diagnosis in \neach case. \n Untangling whether gene expression patterns are associated with resistance or host plant \n(detoxification enzymes can be overexpressed after adaptation to pesticides and plant \nallelochemicals) \n Understanding of dominance and fitness cost of the resistance marker increases confidence \nthat molecular screening will mirror phenotypic response.  \n Robustness, accuracy, and cost effectiveness of the diagnostic assay to capture the marker \n \nIn terms of certainty regarding the presence of resistance, molecular-based methods will confirm \nif the known mechanism is present or not. But they can potentially miss other unknown/novel \nforms of resistance that haven’t been identified (Nauen et al., 2015). The genetic structure of pest \nwhitefly populations can change over the course of a season (Dinsdale et al., 2012) and incursions \nof resistant genotypes of a pest can potentially carry new resistance mechanisms as seen in \nMyzus persicae (de Little et al., 2017). See the 2015 GRDC final report “Investigation into the \npossible recent incursion of an insecticide-resistant biotype of green peach aphid into Australia” \nby Owain Edwards for further information https://grdc.com.au/research/reports/report?id=6823 . \nBioassays detect changes in phenotypic response and can therefore detect resistance without \nknowledge of the underlying mechanism. But without adequate baseline susceptibility data, \ninterpretation of results, such as separating heritable resistance from vigour tolerance or natural \nvariability can be difficult.  \nAn advantage of full dose response bioassays is the output generated; lethal concentration (LC) \nvalues, slope, and resistance factors (difference between a known susceptible population and \nthe tested population at a given LC). Pairing the two approaches, bioassays with molecular \ntechniques is the most reliable way of detecting resistance, particularly in cases where the \nfrequency in the population is still low. \nPreservation of insects prior to DNA extraction \nInsects preserved for later DNA extraction, are typically stored in 95-99.5% ethanol or acetone, or \nin a freezer (-20 to -80°C) or combination of these (Nakahama et al., 2019). Alternative \npreservatives include propylene glycol, RNAlater® and dimethyl sulfoxide (Moreau et al., 2013; \nVink et al., 2005). \nDNA extraction methods \nThere are several methods of DNA extraction from insects. The end-use (high-quality sequencing \nor basic PCR) will guide the method used. The method chosen will also impact the storage life of \nthe extracted DNA.  \n Extraction kits \nEasy to use extraction kits have been developed to simplify the process. These include \nthe silica-based QIAGEN DNeasy blood and tissue kit in either spin column or 96 well-\nplates formats.  \n Detergent lysis extraction \nLysis extraction is a whitefly DNA extraction procedure based on Barro and Driver (1997). \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  29 of 40 \nIt uses a Lysis buffer (50 mM KCL, 10 mM Tris-HCl (ph 8.0), 0.45% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.45 \n(v/v) Triton X, made up to 200 mL with milliQ water and proteinase K). A single preserved \nwhitefly is removed from ethanol and transferred to the side of a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge \ntube. After the ethanol has evaporated away, 10 µL of lysis buffer is added and the \nsample homogenised using a pestle (pestles can be made from 500 µl modified pipette \ntip), before a further 15 µL of lysis buffer is added. The sample is centrifuged then \nincubated at 65°C for 60 minutes, with a further incubation step at 95°C for 15 minutes \n(which inactivates the proteinase K). The sample is centrifuged again and then 25 µL of \nsterile water is added to yield a final homogenate volume of 50 µL.  \n Chelex extraction \nA cost-effective method of DNA extraction is to use chelex resin (Chelex® 100). \nSpecimens are generally crushed or homogenized (White et al., 2009), however the \nmethod can be used for uncrushed specimens (Miura et al., 2017). Specimens are typically \nplaced in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with 50 µL of chelex and 6 µL of proteinase K then \nhomogenized. The samples are centrifuged and then incubated at 37°C for 1 hour on a dry \nheating block. To inactivate the proteinase K the samples are incubated at 96°C for 8 \nminutes. Extracted samples are stored at -20°C; samples should be used within 1-2 months \n(D. Brookes, personal communication). Prior to use in PCR, defrost, vortex and centrifuge \nat full speed for 20 minutes. Always pipette from the very top of the solution to ensure \nchelex is not taken up into the PCR, as it inhibits the reaction and other downstream \napplications. \nPCR \nPCR makes it possible to specifically address a particular DNA sequence and amplify it to \nextremely high copy numbers, making it possible to study in detail. PCR combines the unique \nattributes of being very sensitive and specific with a great degree of flexibility. The PCR reaction \nuses a few standardised components: \n Water \n PCR Buffer \n MgCL2 \n dNTPs \n Forward Primer \n Reverse Primer \n Target DNA \n Polymerase (TAQ) \n \nSpecies ID \nTo separate between the two endemic Australian B. tabaci (AUS I and AUS II), Wongnikong et al. \n(2019) used Chelex extraction (as described above). PCR was used to amplify a 819 bp region of \nthe mtCOI gene, using the primer C1-J-2195 (5’–TTGATTTTTTGGTCATCCAGAAGT-3’) and L2-N-3014 \n(5’-TCCAATGCACACTTAATCTGCCATATTA-3’) (Simon et al., 1994).  \nEach 30 µl reaction contained 2 µl DNA template, 1U MyTaq Polymerase (Bioline, Australia), 0.2 \nµM of each PCR primer and 1x buffer. PCR reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation \nat 95°C for 3 min, followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, annealing at 45°C for 30 s, and 1 min \nextension at 72°C, then 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, annealing at 50°C for 30 s, and 1 min extension at \n72°C, and the final extension was at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were verified by agarose gel \nelectrophoresis and cleaned using 1 U of Exonuclease I and Antarctic Phosphatase (New England \nBiolabs, Ipswich, Mass., USA) by incubating at 37°C for 20 min followed by 10 min enzyme \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  30 of 40 \ndenaturation at 80°C. The clean products were sequenced using the same forward and reverse \nprimers used for PCR, by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Republic of Korea). \nSequences were aligned with representative B. tabaci mtCOI haplotypes (from the National \nCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)) plus some unpublished sequences of Australian B. \ntabaci (S.L. van Brunschot, unpublished), using MUSCLE, and checked for premature stop \ncodons, indels and frameshift mutations (indicators of pseudogenes) by manually checking all \nnucleotide sequences, including the translation of each sequence, in Geneious version 9.1.8 \n(http://www.geneious.com). The alignment was trimmed to 655 bp and a Bayesian tree was \nconstructed with MrBayes (using the GTR + I + G model after checking for the best model with \njmodeltest (Darriba et al., 2012; Guindon and Gascuel, 2003). in Geneious version 9.1.8using \n100,000 iterations for the burn-in followed by 1,000,000 iterations. \nDetecting mutations SNPS \nPCR can also be used to detect genomic mutations that result in resistance to insecticides. For \nexample the diagnostic assay developed by Tsagkarakou et al. (2009) for detecting pyrethroid \nresistant B. tabaci. It distinguishes between resistant (I925 or V9292) and susceptible (L925 or \nT929) para-type voltage gated sodium channel alleles. The diagnostic assay for the detection of \nthe L925I mutation is based on the PCR amplification of a 184 bp fragment within the IIS4-5 linker \nof the B. tabaci sodium channel gene, using the allele specific primers Bt-kdrF1 (5’-\nGCCAAATCCTGGCCAACT-3’) and Bt-kdr-RIntr1 (5’-GAGACAAAGTCCTGTAGC-3’), and subsequent \nrestriction digestion with the enzyme DdeI. DdeI recognises one site in the amplified fragment of \nthe susceptible allele (L925), and the digestion yields two fragments of 124 and 60 bp. \nRNA \nQuantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is used when the starting material is RNA. In \nthis method, RNA is first transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase \nfrom total RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA). The cDNA is then used as the template for the qPCR \nreaction.  \nFuture directions  \nThere are several new developments in molecular diagnostics that may change how resistance \nmonitoring is conducted. \nDroplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is the a recent development in PCR that can be used to accurately \ndetect target site mutations with a larger pooled sample of non-target DNA (Mavridis et al., \n2022). Droplet digital PCR is a digital PCR method utilising a water-oil emulsion droplet system. \nDroplets are formed in a water-oil emulsion to from the partitions that separate the template \nDNA molecules. The droplets serve essentially the same function as individual test tubes or wells \nin a plate in which the PCR reaction takes place – but in much smaller format. The massive sample \npartitioning is a key aspect of the ddPCR technique. \nThe Droplet Digital PCR System partitions nucleic acid samples into thousands of nanoliter-sized \ndroplets, and PCR amplification is carried out within each droplet (Hindson et al., 2011). This \ntechnique has a smaller sample requirement than other commercially available digital PCR \nsystems, reducing cost and preserving precious samples.  \nBenefits of ddPCR (as reported by the manufacturer bio-rad https://www.bio-rad.com/en-au/life-\nscience/learning-center/introduction-to-digital-pcr/what-is-droplet-digital-\npcr?ID=MDV31M4VY#Hindson). ddPCR technology enables high-throughput digital PCR in a \nmanner that uses lower sample and reagent volumes and reduces overall cost compared with \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  31 of 40 \nother methods while maintaining the sensitivity and precision that are the hallmarks of digital \nPCR. The benefits of ddPCR technology include: \n Absolute quantification — ddPCR technology provides an absolute count of target DNA \ncopies per input sample without the need for running standard curves, making this \ntechnique ideal for measurements of target DNA, viral load analysis, and microbial \nquantification \n Unparalleled precision — the massive sample partitioning afforded by ddPCR enables the \nreliable measurement of small fold differences in target DNA sequence copy numbers \namong samples \n Increased signal-to-noise ratio — high-copy templates and background are diluted, \neffectively enriching template concentration in target-positive partitions, allowing for the \nsensitive detection of rare targets and enabling a ±10% precision in quantification \n Removal of PCR bias — error rates are reduced by removing the amplification efficiency \nreliance of qPCR, enabling the detection of small (1.2-fold) differences \n Simplified quantification — neither calibration standards nor a reference (the ΔΔCq \nmethod) is required for absolute quantification \n Reduced consumable costs — reaction volumes are in the pico- to nanoliter ranges, \nreducing reagent use and the sample quantity required for each data point \n Lower equipment costs — the emulsion-based reaction system means that the PCR \nreactions can be performed in a standard thermal cycler without complex chips or \nmicrofluidics \n Superior partitioning — ddPCR technology yields 20,000 droplets per 20 µl sample, nearly \ntwo million partitioned PCR reactions in a 96-well plate, whereas chip-based digital PCR \nsystems produce only hundreds or thousands of partitions. The greater number of \npartitions yields higher accuracy \n \nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an alternative method to PCR that amplifies \nDNA with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions (Notomi et al., \n2000). The advantages of LAMP are it has rapid and simple protocols, minimum equipment \nrequired, can be deployed under field conditions, while its shortcomings include difficulty in \nmultiplexing, it’s only a qualitative method and it has lower specificity and sensitivity in allele \ndetection compared to other more advanced methodologies (e.g., pyrosequencing) (Vontas and \nMavridis, 2019). Allele-specific LAMP (AS-LAMP) has been used to detect pyrethroid resistance in \nAnopheles gambiae and could discriminate between wild-type homozygote, heterozygote and \nresistant homozygote within 75 minutes (Badolo et al., 2012). The AS-LAMP method has the \nadvantage of being faster and at least as sensitive and specific as the AS-PCR method (Badolo et \nal., 2012). LAMP has also been used to identify B. tabaci (Blaser et al., 2018) and distinguish \nbetween members of the B. tabaci cryptic species complex, e.g. MEAM1 and MED (Hsieh et al., \n2012). \nOther ‘field-friendly’ technologies include the Oxford Nanopore MinION (Boykin et al., 2019) and \nportable qPCR platforms e.g. Genedrive® (Unwin et al., 2018) have been demonstrated to be \ncapable of point-of-need field diagnostics, but both require significant capital investment. \nHigh-throughput multiplex real-time PCR assays (Taqman, High Resolution Melt (HRM) and Melt-\nCurve Assay (MCA)) are fluorescence-based ‘closed-tube’ assays that can be used to genotype \npooled individuals without post-PCR processing (gel-electrophoresis) (Vezenegho et al., 2009)  \n  \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  32 of 40 \nReferences \nAhmad, M., and Akhtar, K.

Evidence of B. tabaci ASIA II in \nAustralia has been recently published, with detections reported in Darwin, Kununurra, and \nEmerald (Wongnikong et al., 2021). B. tabaci ASIA II was not detected in our samples, but Emerald \nwas the only region where surveillance overlapped with Wongnikong et al., (2021). As the cotton \nindustry establishes into new regions, particularly in Northern Australia, increased surveillance in \nthese regions will be required. \nUsing both bioassay and DNA sequencing, the level of resistance to pyrethroids in silverleaf \nwhitefly populations collected in 2020 and 2021 was determined. Almost all populations had \nresistance with frequencies between 1.1 and 4.7% The two techniques were not 100% correlated \nbut given the low frequency of resistance, the results are reliable and suggest that the \ndiscriminating dose of 300 mg/L is accurate. These results form part of a larger, recently \npublished study (Fang et al., 2022) that was completed in collaboration with CSIRO and the \nUniversity of Canberra. \nIn 2020, the project looked at the toxicity of imidacloprid to silverleaf whitefly collected from \ncotton. The initial aim was to develop baseline susceptibility data, instead, we found widespread \nresistance to imidacloprid in many of the tested populations. Testing of the lab resistant strain \nthat was established in 2015 from Griffith (selected with clothianidin), revealed strong cross-\nresistance between imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin when tested with a \nfoliar assay. Cross-resistance was less pronounced when a systemic assay was used. In the \nresistant strain, low level cross-resistance was observed to acetamiprid. Interestingly testing to \ndate of field populations has not detected clear evidence of resistance to acetamiprid. Based on \ntesting of our neonicotinoid-resistant lab strain and published literature there is no cross-\nresistance between imidacloprid and dinotefuran. No evidence of resistance to dinotefuran was \nobserved in any of the populations tested in the past three years. Cross-resistance between \nimidacloprid and pymetrozine was observed in 2020 and is well documented in the scientific \nliterature. It can be surmised that the use of neonicotinoids like imidacloprid or clothianidin could \nfavour SLW population increases by disrupting natural enemies if used to control other pests \n(e.g., clothianidin to manage Nezara viridula). \nWhitefly resistance to pyriproxyfen remains a concern, with populations being detected with \nresistance despite the introduction of an application window designed to reduce selection \npressure. Initial results were promising with a significant decline in the number of populations \ndetected with resistance, particularly during 2018/19 and 2019/20. However, in more recent \nseasons (2020/21 & 2021/22) there has been an increase in the number of populations where \nresistance was detected, and it does not appear to be linked to usage in cotton. Data collected in \n2021 (CCA annual market audit) showed industry-wide use of pyriproxyfen was low, and use has \nbeen steadily declining since the 2017/18 season. Year to year variability in the detection of \nresistance in populations is therefore hard to explain. Reducing selection pressure through the \nintroduction of the application window does rely on the assumption that fitness costs are \nassociated with insecticide resistance (Freeman et al., 2021). If this is not correct for pyriproxyfen \nresistant B. tabaci as speculated by Crowder et al. (2009) than the resistance allele frequency may \nstabilise at a level where resistance is retained, particularly if there is an absence of susceptible \nmigrants. This may explain the recent results but would require further quite challenging \nresearch to resolve. \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  37 of 40 \nLow level resistance to spirotetramat was detected from several regions in the past three years. \nBioassay results are supported by DNA sequencing that showed the frequency of the mutation \nwas between 1 and 4%. This finding has been extended to industry and proactive changes were \nmade to the IRMS with the aim of reducing selection pressure. Based on analysis of CCA market \naudit data, spirotetramat usage has seen a rapid increase. Extension of these research findings, \nwhich highlight the potential risk of resistance developing to spirotetramat must continue. \nBuprofezin was registered in 2020 and has the potential to be used in place of either \nspirotetramat or pyriproxyfen. Like pyriproxyfen it is an insect growth regulator, but is specific to \nhomopteran pests (whitefly, leafhoppers, scale insects), so has low impact on most natural \nenemies. Compared to pyriproxyfen and spirotetramat it has limited translaminar activity and \ninstead relies on contact and vapour activity. Results collected over the past three years show no \nsign of pre-existing resistance to buprofezin. Resistance has been detected in other countries \nwhere buprofezin has been used to control whitefly, so overreliance needs to be avoided and \nreflecting this sentiment, a restriction on it use was added to the IRMS shortly after its \nregistration.  \nTesting of silverleaf whitefly with diafenthiuron, emamectin benzoate, and cyantraniliprole over \nthe past three years show no changes, with no evidence of resistance detected. Baseline \nsusceptibility of silverleaf whitefly to afidopyropen and flupyradifurone was evaluated and this \ndata can be called upon if changes are made to their registration. \nA review of molecular-based methods for resistance screening was completed and has proven \nvaluable for the adoption of these approaches in recent research. To date ethanol samples of > \n80 field populations have been sequenced to determine the frequency of mutations in ace1, vgsc, \nand ACC genes that are linked to OP/carbamate, pyrethroid and spirotetramat resistance, \nrespectively. \nParasitism of silverleaf whitefly by wasps including Eretmocerus hayati can be substantial and \nprovide meaningful biological control. However, parasitism in whitefly can be difficult to detect \nand the skill of categorising nymphs as healthy or parasitised is valuable, particularly now \nsampling is based on temporal changes in nymph population density. As an extension exercise, \nCottonInfo regional extension officers (REOs) participated in training where they evaluated \nparasitism in a field in their region. Project staff provided support in learning the identification \nskill. Having gained experience in identifying parasitism, these REOs have been able to aid local \nagronomists as they adopt the new nymph-based decision support tool. \nReferences \nCahill, M., Gorman, K., Day, S., Denholm, I., Elbert, A., and Nauen, R.

Increase productivity and profitability on \ncotton farms \nCRDC key focus area: 1.3 Protection from biotic threats and \nenvironmental stresses \nPrincipal researcher: Dr Jamie Hopkinson, Senior Research Scientist \nOrganisation: Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, \nQueensland Government  \nStart date: 1/07/2019 \nEnd date: 30/06/2022 \nObjectives  Monitoring of insecticide resistance in silverleaf whitefly  \n Biosecurity surveillance of whitefly in cotton production regions \n Silverleaf whitefly parasitism extension \nBackground  Silverleaf whitefly are a major pest of cotton that must be managed to \nlimit their contamination of cotton with honeydew (sticky cotton). As this \npest can readily evolve resistance from insecticides exposure, they must \nbe managed in a way that minimises this risk. Data collected from this \nproject is used to make informed changes to the insecticide resistance \nmanagement strategy (IRMS) for the cotton industry with the aim of \nproviding sustainable management options for silverleaf whitefly \nResearch activities Annual insecticide resistance testing was conducted on silverleaf whitefly \ncollected from cotton production regions. Insecticides included \npyriproxyfen, spirotetramat, buprofezin, bifenthrin and acetamiprid. \nSpecies composition of collected whitefly was determined using DNA \nbarcoding. Populations were sequenced for the presence of known \nresistance mutations to pyrethroids, organophosphates and \nspirotetramat. An extension training exercise on whitefly parasitism was \ncompleted with CottonInfo regional extension officers. \nOutputs The project annually reported the insecticide resistance status of \nsilverleaf whitefly and where applicable suggested appropriate changes \nto the IRMS to CRDC, Cotton Australia via the TIMS IRMS technical panel. \nOther industry outputs included presentations at industry extension \nevents (CSD cotton management tour), extension articles (Spotlight, \nAustralian cottongrower, and extension factsheets for the CottonInfo \nextension network. Research was presented at the Australian Cotton \nResearch Conference, October 2019 and in three scientific journal \npublications. \n \n \nCRDC ID: DAQ2001      For Public Release    \nSustainable silverleaf whitefly management final report  40 of 40 \nImpacts  Annual monitoring of insecticide resistance in whitefly has forewarned \nthe industry of the emergence of resistance to spirotetramat, and \nrestrictions in use have been implemented via the IRMS which aim to slow \nthe evolution of resistance to this highly effective and IPM-compatible \ninsecticide.  \nThis project has provided data to support the ongoing use of a ‘30-day \nspray window’ for pyriproxyfen that has helped reduce the selection \npressure that pyriproxyfen was being exposed to. While data from this \nproject shows resistance to pyriproxyfen is an ongoing issue, resistance \nlevels as measured by LC50 have stabilised. \nAwareness of the value of parasitoids as natural sources of whitefly \npopulation suppression was extended to the industry via training of \nCottonInfo Regional Extension Officers, providing them with the skill to \nassist agronomists or growers in their region identify the activity of \nparasitoids in fields they are managing. \nKey publications CottonInfo factsheets \nResistance monitoring 2020/21 season \nManaging silverleaf whitefly in Australian cotton \n \nConference presentation \nHopkinson, J., Pumpa, S., van Brunschot, S., Fang, C., Frese, M., Tay, W.

The need for new diagnostics\nNo one can afford to take biosecurity for granted. \nAustralia’s primary production sector is worth \n$93billion1 and intrinsically connected to our food \nand economic security. Continual vigilance and \nimprovement in biosecurity measures is essential \nat all levels, from our national borders to every \nfarm gate.\nAs an island continent, Australia enjoys natural protection \nfrom many of the world’s most destructive plant pests. Within \nthe country, large deserts also provide a degree of protection \nfrom species that exist in some regions and not others.\nHowever, biosecurity is not a static problem. Climate change \nis expanding the habitats of existing pests, aiding the \npotential spread and survival of invasive tropical species, and \ndriving weather that can support more explosive pest and \ndisease breeding events.\nHuman activity is another major risk factor. Trade, migration, \ntransport and tourism enable the entry and spread of \nbiosecurity threats. Pests can travel on ships, containers \nand trucks, on-farm equipment, with transient farm workers, \nor simply in fruit being carried in a car or caravan. Human \nmovement enables pests to rapidly bridge international and \ninternal boundaries, to infest new areas where they may be \nunconstrained by predators or plant resistance.\nWhile transport and labour logistics have changed markedly \nover recent decades, so too have the technologies that can \nbe applied to biosecurity testing. Remote communication, \nautomation, molecular biology and more have all evolved to \nthe point where advanced laboratory technologies can be \naccessed rapidly and cost-effectively, or even deployed in \nthe field as tools or kits.\nThe Boosting diagnostic capacity for plant production \nindustries project focused on plant production sectors \nincluding grain, cotton, sugar, horticulture, viticulture and \nforestry. The project oriented around high-priority exotic pest \nspecies — generally invertebrates and bacteria that are not \nyet present in Australia but have a high risk of arriving here \nand posing a significant danger to our crops.\nAs a rule, the speed with which such a pest or disease \nincursion could be detected, contained and eradicated is \ndirectly related to how quickly the threat can be identified. \nLeveraging the latest technology to improve the speed and \nprecision of biosecurity activity has a direct effect on the \nindustry’s ability to identify, trace and manage outbreaks. \nExtension work that ensures diagnosticians are familiar with \nthe available tools, tests and information resources is critical \nto advancing biosecurity capacity. \nBringing these capabilities to life has taken a multi-faceted \napproach, ranging from genomic sequencing so lab staff can \naccurately identify bacteria, to producing fact sheets that will \nhelp growers identify and respond to insect pests in their \ncrops.\n1  Source: ABARES Snapshot of Australian Agriculture 2023\nPhoto: GRDC.\n8      BOOSTING DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY FOR PLANT PRODUCTION INDUSTRIES\n2. Plant production threats\nThe high priority plant pests (HPPPs) at the focus of the Boosting diagnostic capacity for plant production \nindustries project are as diverse as the sectors they threaten. Some of the significant biosecurity threats \nbeing addressed by the research, development and extension activities are detailed here.\nKhapra beetle  \n(Trogoderma granarium)\nKhapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium) is \nAustralia’s number one national priority plant \npest for grains (and number two national plant \npest overall). A native of India, it has spread to \nnorthern Africa, the Middle East and south Asia. \nThe beetle feeds on stored grain and dried \nfoodstuffs, causing damage and contamination. \nKhapra beetle can survive for long periods \nwithout feeding and multiply rapidly when \nconditions are suitable. It can travel in cracks \nor crevices inside shipping containers and will \ninhabit a wide range of cargo types from foods \nto cardboard packaging, wooden doors and \neven plastic beads or nuts and bolts. \nThe pest is difficult to detect and remove, \nmeaning its establishment in Australia could be \ndevastating for grain exports and market access. \nAphids/Mealybugs \nAphids and mealybugs are both worldwide \npests of cropping plants, and are widespread \nin Australia. Populations can build up very \nrapidly and they feed by inserting mouthparts \ninto a plant to suck its sap. Both aphids and \nmealybugs can act as vectors for viruses, while \nmealy bugs also exude a sticky ‘honeydew’ that \ncan promote fungal growth.\nBegomoviruses \nBegomoviruses are known worldwide, \nincluding in Asia, the Americas, Africa \nand Europe, with relatively few examples \ncurrently found in Australia. The main vector \nis the silverleaf whitefly and a wide range of \nimportant crops can be infected, including \npotatoes, carrots, capsicums and cotton. \nPoleroviruses (Luteoviridae)\nPoleroviruses are known to cause 26 highly \ndamaging diseases, including potato leaf roll \nvirus, turnip yellows virus, cotton leafroll virus \nand more. Infection can cause significant plant \ndamage and yield loss.\nCyst nematodes (Heterodera)\nThis large group of microscopic soil-borne \ninvertebrates affects a diverse range of crops, \ninfesting and damaging the roots. While several \nspecies are present in Australia, there are \nmany problem species that exist in Europe, the \nAmericas, Africa and Asia which could impact \non Australian cropping. Nematodes are easily \nspread by transporting infested soil on plants, \nequipment, vehicles or footwear. \nPine wilt nematode and Red ring \nnemotode (Bursaphelenchus)\nThese microscopic worm species are a highly \ninvasive exotic threats to tree crops. Both are \ntoo small to see but their insect vectors and \ndead or dying trees are both signs of possible \ninfestation. Pine wilt nematode is spread by \npine sawyer beetles (sp. Monochamus) and can \naffect pine, fir, cedar, larch and spruce. Red ring \nnematode is spread by exotic palm weevils (sp. \nRhynchophorus) which feeds on date, coconut \nand oil palms. \nPhoto: PaDIL.\nPhoto: PaDIL.\nPhoto: Piotr Trebicki.\nPhoto: QDAF.Photo: Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, WA.\nPhoto: John  Fisher, UofA.\nBOOSTING DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY FOR PLANT PRODUCTION INDUSTRIES      9\nFusarium oxysporum spp.\nFusarium oxysporum is a large family of soil \nborne fungi, with both pathogenic and non-\npathogenic forms. These affect more than \n100 different plant species, including many \nimportant crops in Australia.\nGrapevine red blotch virus (GRBV)\nGRBV was first detected on vines in California’s \nNapa Valley in 2008 and has since been found \non vines throughout the Americas and in \nEurope. The disease causes blotching on leaves \nand prevents sugar accumulation in the fruit. It \nhas been detected in Western Australia, South \nAustralia and Victoria without full symptoms \ndeveloping. It is thought to be carried on new \nplantings and several sap sucking insects may \nbe disease vectors. \nXanthomonas fragariae\nThis bacterial infection of strawberry leaves \nwas first reported in Minnesota, USA, in 1960 \nand has now spread around the world. It is still \nnot well understood but appears to be more \nvirulent under humid conditions. \nXanthomonas citri subsp malvacearum\nThis is an exotic bacterial blight that infects \nthe leaves of cotton plants causing long, \nblack lesions. While several strains exist in \nAustralia, local cotton varieties have effective \nresistance. However, there is a danger of new \nstrains evolving, or of virulent new strains \nbeing introduced on green plant matter from \noverseas. Hypervirulent strains of the bacteria \nare known to exist in North Africa. \nXanthomas axonopodis pv allii\nXanthomonas leaf blight is a bacterial blight \ninfecting onion, garlic, shallot, leek and similar \ncrops. It can be spread by the movement of \ninfested soil, plant material and seed, and can \ncause yield losses ranging from reduced bulb \nsize to total crop failure. Infection causes tan \nleaf lesions, which impact photosynthesis.\nSpotted winged drosophila \n(Drosophila suzukii)\nA fruit fly originating in southeast Asia, spotted \nwing drosophila is now becoming a major pest \nin both Europe and North America. It infests \nfruit during early ripening. Fruit fly are easily \ntransported and readily colonise new habitats. \nEstablishment of D. sukukii in Australia would \npose a grave threat to our fruit production and \nmarket access.\nAsian and African citrus psyllid \n(Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae)\nAsian and African citrus psyllids are sap-sucking \ninsects that feed on young citrus trees, stunting \nstem and leaf formation. Both species can be \nvectors for the devastating huanglongbing \n(citrus leaf greening) virus. Psyllids can only fly \nshort distances but are easily transported on \nplant material.\nTomato potato psyllid  \n(TPP, Bactericera cockerelli)\nTPP is a small, winged sap-sucking insect that \nfeeds on a range of plants including tomato, \npotato, capsicum, chilli, goji berry, tamarillo, \neggplant and sweet potato. It has become \nestablished in Western Australia since 2017, \nwith management practices and restrictions on \nmoving susceptible plants and plant material in \nplace to stop its spread to other states.\nYellow canopy syndrome (YCS)\nYCS is a relatively new and unknown condition \naffecting sugar that has spread southwards \nsince it first affected Far North Queensland \ncane fields in 2012. Its cause and origins remain \nunclear and there is no known management \nsolution. Early indications are that insects may \nbe associated with YCS.\nPhoto: PaDIL.Photo: PaDIL.\nPhoto: PaDIL.

The building blocks  \n of our biosecurity\nAustralia’s biosecurity infrastructure comprises a network of federal, state and industry-specific bodies \nproviding surveillance, diagnostic and information services.\nAs a result, the lion’s share of biosecurity lies with industry, \nthrough high levels of participant awareness and a rapid, \ntargeted response to any outbreak.\nThe Boosting Diagnostic Capacity for Plant Production \nIndustries project aimed to support this fundamental \ninfrastructure by investing in diagnostics research, capacity \nbuilding and enablement.\nSurveillance and screening at international borders is the \nmost obvious way to protect Australian agriculture from \ninvasive threats. However, the task is enormous, with millions \nof containers, packages, travellers and their luggage entering \nthe country every year. Furthermore, many High Priority Plant \nPests (HPPPs) are elusive, highly mobile and/or microscopic. \n\nBOOSTING DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY FOR PLANT PRODUCTION INDUSTRIES      11\nBiosecurity\n1. Diagnostic capacity building through diagnostic training; \nexotic pest identification workshops; building surge \ncapacity for high-priority pests; and enabling faster \ndiagnosis by reducing bottlenecks and boosting capacity. \nThis ensures Australia’s biosecurity system is fully enabled \nand fit for purpose.\n2. Enhanced diagnostic tools including ‘early indicators’ \nfor HPPPs; improvements to critical reference collections; \nimproving national diagnostic protocols for HPPPs; and \ndetermining the geographical origin of pests in incursions \nto better inform trade decisions. These steps will enable \nfaster and more accurate identification of potential pests, \nusing the latest diagnostic technologies.\nAdoption of R&D\n3. In-field detection, sampling and diagnostic ‘blitz’ exercises \nfor primary producers and on-ground personnel to increase \nawareness of selected HPPPs and testing protocols and \nto drive nationwide adoption of improved sampling and \ndiagnostic techniques. This will help ensure biosecurity \nstaff are familiar with the processes they will use to \nmanage biosecurity incidents and helps identify potential \nbottlenecks in the new processes.\nAny introduced pest could cause enormous economic and \nreputational damage to our primary production industries, \nwith severe ramifications for farmers and consumers, food \nsecurity and the wider economy.\nHaving the right capabilities in the right hands – and in \nthe right place – is the key to detecting, containing and \neradicating any exotic high-priority plant pest.\n\nProgram map\nBOOSTING DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY FOR PLANT PRODUCTION INDUSTRIES \n(a Rural R&D For Profit program funded project)\nOBJECTIVE 1 – Building industry skills and capability  \n(industry capability)\nThis will be achieved by lifting capability through:-\nIndustry Network Training \n• Review & staff training of Tasmanian \nNPPPs+HPPPs - TAS DPIPWE\n• ASSCT Presentation - SRA\n• NT Farmers Federation - NT DPIR\n• Articles in Project Partner Publications \npresentations at Aust.

Specific activities \nincluded:\n1. Capacity building: Prioritising HPPP threats in Tasmania \nand developing training resources on key pests, \nconducting workshops for industry, educating biosecurity \noperations personnel and developing sample submission \nkits.\n2. Enhancing diagnostic tools: Improving the Tasmanian \nAgricultural Insect Collection holdings of HPPP examples, \nand increasing proficiency in testing for HPPPs. \n3. Field ‘blitz’ exercises to give industry and biosecurity staff \nhands-on experience of in-field detection and diagnostics \nfor a plant pest outbreak.\nOUTCOMES  \nAs a result of this project:\n- Industry and biosecurity operations staff improved their \nknowledge of, and ability to detect, HPPPs through practice \nsample submissions and reporting training.\n- Biosecurity information and response networks were \nimproved.\n- The plant health diagnostics capacity and competency of \nlocal laboratories was improved. \nOUTLINE \nThe Victorian DEECA undertook four major lines of research \nto boost diagnostic capacity for plant production industries:\n1. Whole genome sequencing and effector diversity in \nAustralian Fusarium oxysporum species to support the \ndevelopment of high throughput diagnostic tests for \nsubspecies (formae speciales) of this important soil-\nborne pathogen. These would provide specific molecular \ndetection in rapid, accurate and efficient tests.\n2. Developing expertise in nematode identification, along \nwith new testing methods to reduce reliance on the skills \nand availability of individual specialists.\n3. Building surge capacity for industry surveillance, in-field \ntriage and high-throughput testing during a high priority \npest incident, with a specific focus on grapevine red \nblotch virus and Xanthomonas fragariae.\n4.

Over time, the industry is increasingly moving \nback to relying on residual herbicides to manage herbicide resistant weeds in cotton, in \nrotation crops and in fallows, with glyphosate now ineffective for controlling some grass and \nbroadleaf weeds, and resistance to the grass herbicides (Group 1) and paraquat also \nbecoming increasingly common. \nWith the increasing use of residual herbicides, comes the problem of crop safety to the \nfollowing crop, an even more difficult issue in dryland cropping, where rotations are often \ndetermined by planting opportunities, but selection of a residual herbicide applied in the \nfallow may restrict these options. The issues are further complicated by the increasing range \nof herbicides available for fallow use, with multiple herbicides potentially applied and multiple \napplications within a fallow period common. On top of this, camera sprayers are becoming \nstandard in the industry and it is common to apply higher than normal rates through these \nrigs. There is a big need to explore the potential for these herbicides and herbicide \ncombinations and rates to damage following cotton and other rotation crops. \nThe primary research focus of this project was on the impact of residual herbicides applied \nto rotation crops and in fallows on the following cotton crops. Research was carried out over \na series of seasons (replicated in time), on replicated, randomised field experiments, some \nwith split-plot designs, in fields grown under typical commercial conditions. Components \nwere tested at Warwick (Southern Qld), Narrabri (Northern NSW) and Leeton (Southern \nNSW). The experiments were on solid plant, irrigated cotton, picked with modified \ncommercial pickers, and ginned to determine lint yield. Excessively wet conditions delaying \nherbicide applications and flooding in spring 2022 were challenging for some experiments. \nOur research has highlighted: that a) residual herbicides used in rotation crops, fallows, and \nthrough camera sprayers have the potential to seriously impact following cotton crops, \nreducing seedling vigour and lint yield, and b) combinations of herbicides can be more \ndamaging than expected, such that label crop-safety information may underestimate the \npotential damage from combinations. \nHowever, the limitation of this work was that it could not test every potential herbicide, \nherbicide combination and application scenario. The largest of the experiments (at Narrabri) \nexamined eight in-crop herbicides in two rotation crops (wheat and chickpea) and 9 fallow \nherbicide combinations, a total of 80 treatments, with four replications. While the findings \nfrom the results from this work are extremely valuable to industry, a common scenario in the \ncotton system would be two in-crop herbicides and two or more fallow herbicides, increasing \nthe potential herbicide combinations four-fold or more (as herbicides other than the ones we \nused could have been included). \nFuture research should focus on the impacts of some of the more common multiple-\nherbicide strategies. The current work, for example, showed that the standard cotton \nherbicides are not causing issues for the following rotation crops. However, only single \nherbicides were considered, applied at cotton planting. The potential impact of multiple \nherbicides, some applied pre-crop and others in-crop is yet to be examined, but is likely to \nbe damaging to rotation crops. \nFurther work is also needed to correlate herbicide soil and plant concentrations to crop \ndamage as we note that with more residual damage occurring in the industry and increasing \nconcern around damage from residual herbicides, there is currently no information that can \n3 \n \nrelate herbicide concentrations in soils or plants to damage. Where a grower sees damaged \nplants, it is becoming increasingly common to test for herbicide residues. When a herbicide \nis detected from a laboratory sample, it is assumed that the detected herbicide has caused \nthe damage. However, this may not be the case, and conversely, when no herbicide is \ndetected, this does not necessarily indicate that a given herbicide is not causing the \ndamage. We simply have no data to relate laboratory test results to plant damage and this \nneeds to be addressed. \nHerbicide screening showed that samples of awnless barnyard grass, feathertop Rhodes \nand windmill grass had some level of resistance to glyphosate, the Group 1 grass \nherbicides, paraquat and glufosinate. Theses levels of resistance have big implications for \nmanaging weeds. The resistance to glufosinate is surprising and unexpected and will \ndiminish the value of this relatively new mode of action herbicide to the cotton system, \nespecially if resistance occurs amongst broadleaf weeds. \nThe studies on emerging weeds highlighted the challenges of managing some of these \nweeds, especially as they develop herbicide resistance. Cotton growers and consultants \nneed to be aware of these issues with these weeds and develop management strategies for \nfields where they become problematic. \nThis research has generated a bulk of experimental results that will be published in \ninformation sheets, articles and scientific papers, and delivered to industry through the \nCottonInfo network. \nAlready from this project there have been a series of scientific publications, articles, \nconference presentations, many presentations at grower meetings and conversations with \ngrowers and consultants. More presentations and articles will follow.   \n4 \n \nTable of Contents \nExecutive Summary………………………...…………………………………….………………….2 \nTable of Contents……………………………………………………………………………….……4 \nMilestones 1.1

chickpeas and fallows, monitoring damage and crop responses in \ncotton and rotation crops \n \nBackground \nThe evolution of glyphosate tolerance and resistance in weeds in cotton cropping systems \nhas changed the way growers manage weeds. Before Roundup Ready technology was \nintroduced, growers largely relied on residual herbicide programs, cultivation and chipping to \nmanage weeds in cotton, and glyphosate and 2,4-D to control weeds in fallows. With the \nevolution of glyphosate tolerant and resistant weeds, growers are increasingly being forced \nback to using residual herbicides in crops and fallows, often with multiple residual herbicides \nused over the year. However, there is very limited understanding of how these herbicides \nand combinations may interact and may affect following crops. \nMilestone 1.1 & 1.4 aimed to investigate the effects of residual herbicides used in cotton \ncrops or winter crops and fallow on the following crops. This information will identify potential \nissues in the system. \nThe experiment was conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute at Narrabri and \nsplit into two parts:  A) cotton herbicides preceding winter crops, and B) winter crop and \nfallow residual herbicide combinations preceding cotton. \n \nA) Cotton herbicides preceding winter crops  \nMethods and materials \nCotton herbicide treatments were applied at planting in irrigated cotton as split plots within a \nrandomised complete block design with 4 replicates, with herbicides (sub-plots) applied \nwithin cotton main-plots which were later sown to wheat or chickpea (main plots), with each \nsub-plot 4 m x 20 m. The experiment consisted of 8 sub-plot treatments as below: \nTreatment Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(x/ha) \nMain plots Wheat \nChickpea \n \nSub plots \n1 \n \nDiuron \n \n2 kg \n2 Fluometuron 4 kg \n3 Metolachlor 1 L \n4 Prometryn 2.5 kg \n5 Pendimethalin 3 L \n6 Terbyn 1.4 kg \n7 Trifluralin 2.3 L \n8 Untreated  \n \nThe winter crops were planted at the end of July in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and irrigated as \nrequired, in line with normal practices. Samples were taken from 1 m of row and 10 plants \nselected for measurements. Plant stand, height, number of leaves, leaf area, and biomass \n7 \n \nwere measured. At the end of the season, crops were harvested with a small plot header to \ndetermine yield. Treatments were applied with a high-clearance sprayer using TTI 110015 \nnozzles at 30 psi and 100 L/ha water. \n \nResults and Discussion \nThe data will be fully analysed next year with the intention of publishing in a scientific journal. \nPreliminary results are as follows, with results from the three seasons combined. \nEffect of residual herbicide applied in cotton on the following wheat crop. \nHerbicide Plant \nstand \n Height  Biomass  Yield  \n (No./m) s.e.

In the first season, the chickpea plant stand was reduced by \n15 – 22% by diuron, fluometuron and prometryn. This translated to a 26% yield reduction on \nthe plots where prometryn had been applied. In the second season, plant stand reductions of \n22 – 26% were recorded from diuron, fluometuron and metolachlor, with a yield reduction of \n8 \n \n39% from diuron. In the third season there were no plant stand effects, but yield was \nreduced by 39% on the Terbyn treatment. However, these effects were not consistent over \ntime except for the reduction in plant stand from diuron, that averaged 12% over the three \nseasons. \nThese effects may have been greater had the herbicides been applied as combinations or \nbeen applied later in the cotton season as herbicide half-lives are impacted by rainfall and \nconditions influencing herbicide breakdown. Nevertheless, the results suggest there are no \nmajor issues for these rotation crops from residuals applied prior to or at planting in cotton. \n \nB) Winter crop and fallow residual herbicide combinations preceding cotton \nMethods and materials \nThe experiment was established as a split plot within a randomised complete block with 4 \nreplicates. The experiment was run over four seasons, with winter crops in 2019, 2020 and \n2021, followed by fallows and cotton crops in 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23. Results are \npresented for the data set combined over years. \nMain plots (field length) were treatments applied in wheat or prior to chickpea emergence \n(Balance and simazine), and fallow treatments were applied along the main plots. Each sub-\nplot was 4 m x 20 m and conducted under irrigation as per typical industry practice. Weeds \nwere controlled using glyphosate applied as necessary. The experiment consisted of eight \nmain plot treatments, as below: \nTreatment Crop Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(x/ha) \nPlant back \nTo cotton \n1 Wheat Atlantis 330 ml 12 months \n2 Chickpea Balance 100 g 7 months \n3 Wheat Hussar 100 g 12 months \n4 Wheat Precept 2 L 12 months \n5 Chickpea Simazine 1.1 kg 12 months \n6 Wheat Starane 900 ml 1 month \n7 Wheat Velocity 1 L 14 months \n8 Wheat Untreated \n \n \n \nThe in-fallow sub-plot treatments were: \nTreatment Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(x/ha) \nPlant back \nTo cotton \n1 Balance 100 g 7 months \n2 Flame 200 ml 24 months \n3 Grazon Extra 400 ml ? \n4 Sakura 118 g 5 months \n5 Sharpen 272 g 6 weeks \n6 Starane 900 ml 1 month \n7 2,4-D amine 1.6 L 21 days \n8 2,4-D amine x8 12.8 L ? \n9 Untreated   \nNote. The usage of Flame in these experiments is outside the label recommendation. \n \n9 \n \nThe eight times rate of 2,4-D was included as a camera-spray treatment comparison, with \ntwo untreated plots in each main-plot. Treatments were applied as per label directions using \na high-clearance sprayer with TTI 110015 nozzles at 30 psi and 100 L/ha water. \nDestructive samples were taken twice early in the cotton growing season. Five plants were \ntaken from each plot and plant stand, plant height, node and leaf counts, leaf area and dry \nweight were measured for each treatment and replication. Leaf area measurements were \ntaken using a leaf area meter. The cotton was defoliated and picked using a single-row plot \npicker and ginned to determine gin turn-out. \n \nResults and discussion \nThe data will be fully analysed next year with the intention of publishing in a scientific journal. \nPreliminary results are as follows, with results from the three seasons combined. \nIn-crop herbicides with no following fallow residual herbicides: \nHerbicide Plant \nstand \n Height  Biomass  Yield  \n (No./m) s.e.

Early-season crop height was reduced by 22 - 41% by Flame, Grazon Extra, Sakura \nand Sharpen. Flame and Grazon Extra also reduced crop biomass by 50% and 54%, \nrespectively. The cotton recovered from this early-season damage from Sakura and \nSharpen, but 15% yield reductions were recorded for Flame and Grazon Extra. \nThese results become far more complex and interesting when the interactions of in-crop and \nfallow herbicides are considered. The complexity would be even more challenging in the real \nworld where multiple herbicides may be used in crop and it would be common to apply \nmultiple residual herbicides over the fallow period.

Growers should follow \nthe label recommendation of a 24 month plant-back to cotton and not apply Flame to a fallow \nin the season prior to cotton. \nGrazon Extra used in the fallow always caused some early-season damage to cotton, \nreducing the plant stand or seedling growth and caused reductions in cotton yield when \nfollowing in-crop applications of Atlantis, Balance, Hussar, Starane or Velocity. Growers \nshould avoid using Grazon Extra in a fallow prior to a cotton crop. \nSakura used in the fallow resulted in plant-stand or seedling damage following all in-crop \nherbicides except Precept, but plants recovered from the damage, with no yield reductions in \nthe cotton. Growers should be cautious when using Sakura in a fallow prior to cotton. \n15 \n \nSharpen used in the fallow caused some plant-stand or seedling damage, depending on the \npreceding in-crop herbicide. Sharpen reduced cotton yields when following Starane used in \nthe preceding crop. Growers should be cautious when using Sharpen in a fallow prior to \ncotton. \nStarane used in the fallow caused some plant-stand or seedling damage, depending on the \npreceding in-crop herbicide, but this early-season damage didn’t lead to a reduction in the \ncrop yield. Growers should be cautious when using Starane in a fallow prior to cotton. \nBalance used in the fallow caused plant-stand and seedling damage and a reduction in the \ncrop yield when following the application of Starane in the preceding crop. Growers should \nbe cautious when using Balance if Starane has been or will be applied. \nResidues of 2,4-D amine have caused crop growth and yield issues for numerous cotton \ngrowers over many years. Nevertheless, in this research, 2,4-D amine applied in the fallow \ncaused no issues to the following cotton crop, even when applied at a rate eight times the \nlabel rate, except when it followed an application of Starane in the wheat crop. These results \nstrongly suggest that crop safety from Starane used in a preceding crop or fallow is of real \nconcern, and far more likely to cause damage than will 2,4-D amine. The symptoms of \ndamage from Starane may be difficult to identify, with the herbicide generally just reducing \nthe plant stand and plant vigour. Growers should be very cautious in their use of Starane in \nthe 18 months prior to cotton. \n \nThese results highlight the complexity of interactions that may occur when multiple \nherbicides are applied to crops and fallows preceding cotton. Cotton growers need to be \naware that the crop plant-back safety information on a herbicide label relates to the use of a \nsingle application of the herbicide with no other herbicides and may not be an accurate guide \nto crop safety when using multiple herbicides. The implication of these results needs to be \napplied to not just the herbicides used in these experiments, but also to other residual \nherbicides that may be used in the farming system. These herbicides may have similar or \ngreater issues than the herbicides reported here.    \n16 \n \nMilestone 1.2. – Explore selected residual options in dryland fields \n \nBackground \nThe evolution of glyphosate resistance in several weeds in cotton cropping systems has \nchanged the way growers need to manage weeds since the introduction of Roundup Ready \ncotton. Before Roundup Ready technology was introduced, growers relied on full residual \nprograms to manage weeds. Since its adoption, growers tended to rely heavily on \nglyphosate. In nearly two decades of reliance on glyphosate, a new generation of growers \nand consultants have had limited experience with the fit of residuals in cotton systems. \nThis milestone aims to investigate the effects of residual herbicides used in fallow and cotton \non the following respective cotton and winter cereals. This information will enable us to \ndetermine which herbicides are likely to cause damage to following crops and which \nherbicides have little or no impact. \n \nResults from Qld \nMethods and materials \nThe experiment was conducted at Hermitage Research Facility, Warwick and split into two \nparts:  A) fallow residual herbicides preceding cotton, and B) cotton herbicides preceding \nwinter cereals. \nPart A \nPart A was established as a randomised complete block with 4 replicates. Each plot was 3 m \nx 10 m. The width of these plot was determined so that when cotton was planted with 2 rows \n1 m apart along the middle of the plot, the whole trial resembled a single-skip configuration. \nThe experiment consisted of eight treatments, outlined below: \nTreatment Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(mL or g/ha) \n1 Untreated  \n2 Balance 100 \n3 Imazapic 200 \n4 Valor 210 \n5 Grazon Extra 400 \n6 2,4-D 1100 \n7 2,4-D x8 8800 \n8 Starane 900 \n \nThe 2,4-D and Starane treatments were included to simulate fallow sprays that may be \nconducted with optical sprayer technology (OST), in particular, the eight times rate of 2,4-D \ntreatment. All treatments were applied with a tractor mounted sprayer with a 2 m shrouded \nboom using TTI110015 nozzles at 30 psi and 100 L/ha water. Treatments 2-5 were applied \nin late June, with the remaining treatments applied in August. Sicot 746B3F was used in \nboth years. In the first year, cotton was planted in late November and irrigated the day after \nplanting. No further irrigation was required with adequate rainfall received for the remainder \nof the season. The repeat experiment in the second year was conducted in a different field. \n17 \n \nCotton was planted in mid-December due to continuous rain preventing the soil from drying \nout enough to plant earlier.  \nDestructive samples were taken 3 times early in the cotton growing season commencing \nwhen the 2nd set of true leaves emerged, then every 2 – 3 weeks after. Five plants were \ntaken from each of the two rows and plant height, node and leaf counts, leaf area and dry \nweight (biomass) were measured and grouped for each treatment and replication. Leaf area \nmeasurements were taken using a leaf area meter. \nIn the first year, cotton was defoliated and picked using a plot picker and ginned in a small \ngin to determine gin turn-out. The trial in the second year was considerably damaged due to \ncontinuous rainfall. As a result, the cotton was unable to be defoliated and machine picked. \nApproximate yield was determined by selecting a 1 m section of each plot, cutting the bolls \nof each plant, and then manually pulling out the lint. Gin turn-out was assumed to be 43% of \nthe original lint and seed weight, as this was the average for year 1. \nPart B \nThis part of the experiment was established as a randomise complete block design with 3 \nreplicates. Each plot was 3 m x 24 m. The plots were this length to plant the 4 winter cereals \n(wheat, durum, barley and chickpea) at right-angles to the way the herbicide treatments \nwere applied. This then allowed for a 6 m wide planting of each cereal, with measurements \ncoming from the middle 2 metres. The experiment consisted of 6 treatments outlined below: \nTreatment Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(mL or g/ha) \n1 Untreated \n \n2 Diuron 2000 \n3 Prometryn 2500 \n4 Trifluralin 2300 \n5 Pendimethalin 3400 \n6 Valor 90 \n \nTreatments were applied 1 day prior to cotton planting, with trifluralin and pendimethalin \nmechanically incorporated within 4 hours. Cotton was then planted through the plots at the \nsame time as Part A. In the first year, cotton was picked at the same time as Part A and then \nthe trial slashed and prepared for planting the winter cereals. The cereals were planted at \nthe end of July. Sampling was conducted 3 times commencing at approximately 2 leaves for \nthe cereals, and 4 nodes for the chickpeas. Samples were then taken at 2 and 4 weeks later. \nSamples were taken from 1 m of row and 10 plants selected for measurements. Plant height, \nnumber of leaves, leaf area, biomass was measured. At the end of the season crops were \nhand harvested from 1 m of row and threshed to obtain yield measurements. \nIn the second year, due to wet conditions, planting didn’t occur until August, and only one \nsampling time was able to be conducted. This occurred just prior to booting. The wet \nconditions and intermittent water logging resulted in the death of the chickpeas, therefore no \ndata was obtained. The other winter cereals were harvested in the same manner as the first \nyear. \n \nResults and discussion \nPart A \n18 \n \nIn the first year of the experiment (2020/21), Imazapic significantly reduced cotton height, \nleaf number and the dry weight at the first sampling time (Figure 1). Imazapic continued to \neffect cotton growth for the remainder of the experiment, with the effects also being seen in \nleaf area. As the season progressed, the effects of Balance were also significant for cotton \nheight, leaf number, leaf area, and dry weight particularly for the sampling time three \n(approximately 14 nodes). Imazapic was the only herbicide to produce a significant reduction \nin cotton yield. Yield in the Imazapic treatment was 1.2 bales/ha, as opposed to 5.7 bales/ha \nin the untreated plots. The yield in the Balance, Grazon Extra, 2,4-D and Starane treatments \nwere lower than the untreated (approximately 4 bales/ha), however this effect was not \nsignificant. The high rate of 2,4-D had no effect on cotton growth and yield in this \nexperiment. There were also no effects of the herbicide treatments on the gin turn-out, which \nwas approximately 43%.The repeat experiment was affected by considerable rainfall with \napproximately 290 mm between applying the herbicide treatments and planting the cotton. \nThere was also approximately 690 mm of in season rain. As a result, the trial was \nunderwater twice, with considerable wash across the plots. No effects on cotton height were \nobserved. No effects on any of the parameters measured were observed for the first two \nsampling times. Starane had the highest values for leaves, leaf area and biomass. This was \nfollowed by Balance, Grazon Extra and 2,4-D. The Imazapic and untreated plots had the \nlowest values for these parameters. These effects did not translate to the yield results. Yield \nwas less than the previous year and ranged from 3.4 bales/ha in the untreated plots down to \n1.1 bales/ha for the Imazapic treatment. The reduction in yield in the 2,4-D treatment was \nalso significant at 1.6 bales/ha. However, the 2,4-D x8 treatment had a statistically similar \nyield to the untreated at 2.9 bales/ha. It is unclear as to why the lower 2,4-D rate had a \ngreater impact on the cotton than the higher rate. \nResults from the repeat experiment are likely to have been affected by high rainfall and \nsubsequent water movement across the trial. However, the effects of Imazapic on cotton \ngrowth and yield were evident in both years. Imazapic is highly water soluble, it is proposed \nthat initial rain moved the herbicide layer down in the profile deep enough not to be moved \naround with soil/water. The other herbicides bind more to the soil, and therefore may have \nmoved with soil when the trial was underwater. The effect of the other herbicides was less \nevident. The phenoxy herbicides applied in the fallow had no significant effect on cotton \nyield, apart from 2,4-D in the repeat experiment. Even the high rate of 2,4-D designed to \nsimulate OST applications had no effect. Reasons for this are unclear. \n \nPart B \nThe maximum plant back to winter cereals for the cotton herbicides used is Diuron, with a \nplant back of 2 years. This is followed by trifluralin at 12 months and Prometryn at 6 months. \nThe remaining herbicides have virtually no plant back concerns for winter cereals. These \nplant backs were reflected in the first seasons results with no significant effects of the \nherbicides on chickpea, wheat and barley (Figures 5-8). The only significant reductions \noccurred on the yield of durum in response to Diuron (0.8 t/ha) and Valor (1 t/ha) compared \nto the untreated plots (1.6 t/ha). \nThe repeat experiment in 2022 was affected by wet conditions. None of the herbicides \napplied at the time of cotton planting had significant effects on the growth and development \nof the winter cereals. The waterlogging conditions resulted in the death of the chickpeas, \nhowever, did not seem to affect the winter cereals. \n19 \n \n \nFigure 1. 2020/21 cotton height, leaves, leaf area and biomass with respect to herbicide treatment. \nThe legend denotes sampling times.

There was no reduction in crop emergence between \nherbicide treatments. However, when averaged across all herbicide treatments \nestablishment was higher from the late planting date, an indication that soil temperatures \nneed to be on a rising trend. In crop weed counts showed pre-emergent herbicides reduced \nweed numbers compared to the control by > 95%. Plant biomass was measured at boll \nmaturity with significant reductions in crop biomass from the control (weedy) and glyphosate \nonly treatments. The field was weed free at planting and after watering up weeds emerged \nwith the cotton. The delay in the application of the first in-crop glyphosate reduced crop \nbiomass by up to 37% compared to residual herbicide treatments. \nPlant height was reduced in the early planting time and where there were high weed \nnumbers early in crop development (Treatment 1 & 2). Several cold shock events early in \nthe crop’s development might also have contributed to the reduced height from TOS 1. \nThere was no significant interaction between herbicide and node numbers per plant. There \nwas a trend toward more nodes on the later planting date. \nCotton yield was greatest from the October 5 plant date which averaged 1bale/ha more than \nSeptember 16 plant date. The highest yield (16.5 b/ha) was from treatment 3; Pendimethalin \n+ glyphosate at plant, followed by Metolachlor + glyphosate OTT and a late glyphosate prior \nto canopy closure. In comparison the control had a yield reduction of 42% (9.7 b/ha) with a \nrange from 5.5 to 11 b/ha across the replicates. \nA small experiment in collaboration with Bayer was conducted to evaluate glufosinate and \nglyphosate application with two timings, one at midday and the second at sunset with three \nwater rates; 50, 100 and 150L/ha. A glufosinate double knock is a robust strategy for control \nof a wide range of weeds. Control improved with higher humidity and as water rates were \nincreased. \nA farming systems experiment using evaluating the efficacy of the suite of Xtend herbicides \nwas repeated at Leeton Research Station. The higher rates of Dicamba in the registered \nproduct provided up to 3 weeks of residual control of sowthistle compared to the control. A \ndouble knock of glufosinate provided >90% control of a range of grass and broadleaf weeds. \nThe efficacy of the glufosinate as improved with early morning (higher humidity conditions) \ncompared to the afternoon applications and there was a significant increase in activity when \nthe water rates increased from 50L/ha to 100L/ha. There was no significant difference \nbetween 100L and 150L/ha water rates.  \n  \n26 \n \nMilestones 1.3 & 1.5 – Explore potential issues with residual use from camera \nsprayers (high rates) and band-sprayers behind header tracts where weed seeds are \nconcentrated \n \nBackground \nThe advent of camera sprayers has enabled growers to manage scattered large weeds in \nfallows by using relatively low rates of applied herbicide per ha and spot-applying herbicide \njust to these weeds. Permits and registrations for the use of higher than normal label rates of \nsome herbicides has facilitated management of these large weeds using camera sprayers \nwhere such weeds would not be killed by a normal herbicide rate. Camera sprayers are \ntypically set up to apply maximum rates, assuming application through a single nozzle. \nHowever, large weeds may trigger more than one nozzle, such that the rate of herbicide \napplied to a large weed could be twice the calibrated rate or more. Consequently, some \nherbicides may be being applied to small areas of a field at very high rates and the tolerance \nof cotton to these applications is not well understood. While generally only a small proportion \nof a fallow is sprayed with these high rates (say 5 – 20% of the field), it is still important to \nunderstand the level of damage that might be occurring to a following cotton crop. \nSimilarly, where crop residues are tram-tracked behind a header, it is common to use higher \nrates of herbicide to manage the flush of weeds that often occurs in these tracks. These \nexperiments aim to measure the tolerance of cotton to potentially higher than normal rates of \nsome residual herbicides. The design used rates of X, 2X, 4X and 8X the standard rates to \ncover the full range of herbicide rates that might occur. \nMethods and materials \nResidual herbicide treatments were applied in the fallow preceding an irrigated cotton crop \nusing a randomise complete block design with 4 replicates. The experiment consisted of 6 \nherbicides, with each herbicide at 1X, 2X, 4X and 8X the standard rates, as shown below: \n \nTreatment Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(x/ha) \nPlant back \nTo cotton \n1 Balance 100 g 7 months \n2 Sharpen 272 g 6 weeks \n3 Starane 900 ml 1 month \n4 Valor 140 g  \n5 Voraxor 240 ml 9 months \n6 2,4-D amine 1.6 L 21 days \n7 Untreated   \nNote. Cotton was planted within the plant-back window for Balance and Voraxor, and as \nsuch, damage to the cotton could be expected at a normal application rate of these \nherbicides. \nThe experiment was conducted over two seasons. The experiment has been expanded and \ncontinued under new CRDC funding and has been planted for a third season in 2023-24. \nHence the results presented below are a summary of two season’s work and do not \nrepresent the final results from this experiment. \n27 \n \nThe herbicides were applied on the 26 July 2021 and 22 June 2022, and the cotton planted \non 10 Oct 2021 and 10 Nov 2022, 76 and 141 days after spraying, respectively. Treatments \nwere applied as per label directions using a high-clearance sprayer with TTI 110015 nozzles \nat 30 psi and 100 L/ha water. The crops were grown in line with normal practices. \nDestructive samples were taken twice early in the cotton growing season. Five plants were \ntaken from each plot and plant stand, plant height, node and leaf counts, leaf area and dry \nweight were measured for each treatment and replication. Leaf area measurements were \ntaken using a leaf area meter. The cotton was defoliated and picked using a single-row plot \npicker and ginned to determine gin turn-out. \n \nResults and discussion \nPreliminary results are as follows, with results from the two seasons combined. \nHerbicide Plant \nstand \n Height  Biomass  Yield  \n (No./m) s.e.

Values in red are less than the untreated value by more than twice the standard error. \nIn-fallow applications of higher rates of Balance, Sharpen, Starane and Voraxor all damaged \nthe following cotton crop, with the 8X rates of Balance and Sharpen and the 2X rate and \nhigher rates of Voraxor reduced cotton lint yield. \nWhen considered over the two seasons, damage from Balance was only observed at the 8X \nrate, with no damage apparent from a 4X rate of Balance. The 8X rate of Balance reduced \nthe plant stand by 19%, early-season crop height 38% and lint yield 26%. However, Balance \nis an unusual herbicide, with a very short half-life in the field, but extremely low solubility. \n28 \n \nConsequently, the break-down rate of Balance is very strongly affected by rainfall following \napplication – each rainfall event dissolves some of the product which then rapidly breaks \ndown. Balance has very limited breakdown under dry conditions. Closer examination of the \ndata reveals damage at the 4X and 8X rates of Balance in the first season, where cotton was \nplanted 76 days after spraying following what was a relatively dry winter. No damage was \napparent in the second season, where cotton was planted 141 days after the herbicide \napplication in a very wet winter. Both the extra time between the herbicide application and \nthe time of cotton planting, and the wet conditions, would have been conducive to break-\ndown of the Balance. Hence, damage from Balance would not be expected in this second \nseason. In the first season, the 8X rate of Balance reduced the plant stand by 74%, early-\nseason crop height and biomass by 72% and 67%, respectively, and lint yield by 56%.   \n4X and 8X rates of Sharpen reduced the plant stand by 20% and 42%, early-season crop \nheight by 24% and 53%, and early-season biomass by 31% and 66%, respectively. Cotton \nrecovered from the 4X rate of Sharpen, with no reduction in lint yield, but the 8X rate gave a \n54% reduction in lint yield, with an 85% reduction in lint yield in the first season. \n4X and 8X rates of Starane reduced the plant stand by 22% and 40%, and early-season \ncrop height by 21% and 40%, respectively. Cotton recovered from the Starane damage, with \nno reduction in lint yield (when averaged over the two seasons). However, again the damage \noccurred primarily in the first season, with the 4X and 8X rates of Starane reducing the plant \nstand by 64% and 94%, respectively, and the 8X rate resulting in a 67% reduction in lint \nyield in this season. \nAll rates of Voraxor caused some damage to the cotton. 2X, 4X and 8X rate reduced the \nplant stand by 44%, 59% and 95%, early season crop height 46%, 68% and 95%, early-\nseason biomass 36%, 75%, and 99%, and cotton lint yield by 24%, 54% and 96%, \nrespectively, with yield reductions from the 4X and 8X rates occurring in both seasons. \nInterestingly, in both this experiment and the previous work (Milestone 1.1), 2,4-D amine at \nrates of up to 8X did not negatively affect cotton establishment, growth or lint yield in either \nseason, although as previously stated, 2,4-D damage has been documented in other \nresearch and there have been numerous examples of crop damage from 2,4-D residues \nreported by the industry. \nThis research shows both the impact of time and seasonal conditions on herbicide \nbreakdown, and also the danger to cotton crops from residual herbicides applied in \npreceding fallows, especially where the herbicides may be applied at higher than normal \nrates, as can occur through camera spray systems. Growers should be very cautious when \napplying Balance, Sharpen, Starane or Voraxor through camera sprayers in fallows \npreceding cotton crops. \n  \n29 \n \nMilestones 2.1 – Evaluate non-chemical weed control options developed in grain \nindustry. Evaluate potential introduction into non-cropping phase of cotton \nBackground \nWeeds remain the bane of farming systems. Systems based on single crops inevitably select \nout weeds that tolerate the system. Minimum tillage systems, for example, become \ndominated by perennial weeds that are favoured by the lack of tillage and systems also \nincluding retained stubble favour surface germinating and wind spread species. Farmers \ngenerally respond to these issues by introducing an additional single herbicide tactic to \nmanage the problem. This approach is unsustainable as the new tactic rapidly selects for \nweeds that tolerate this new input, then requiring inclusion of another new tactic, that again \nselects for resistance, requiring inclusion of yet another new tactic, and so on. \nRather than solving a problem by including a single new tactic, cotton growers need to return \nto more complex systems including multiple herbicide modes of action as well as cultivation \nand cropping rotations that allow the introduction of differing herbicides and control windows, \nbut this also bring complexities with herbicide residues. \nThe grains industry has for many years now been dealing with the challenge of systems that \nprimarily are single crops (wheat), minimum tillage, and are being challenged by several \nweeds (especially ryegrass and wild radish) that have resistance to most of the available \nherbicides. Some of the tools that have been adopted by the grains industry to deal with their \nproblematic weeds are: \n1) Harvest weed seed destruction, \n2) Long fallows with full weed control, \n3) Strategic cultivation, \n4) Targeted weed removal, \n5) Cropping rotations, \n6) Crop competition, \n7) Cover crops, \n8) Delayed sowing, \n9) Autumn tickle, \n10) Robotic weeders, and \n11) Drone sprayers. \n \n1) Harvest weed seed destruction (HWSD) \nHWSD can be undertaken using a variety of techniques that focus on the management of \nweed seeds in the chaff fraction coming from a header at harvest. HWSD techniques range \nfrom mechanical destruction of the seed or collection and burning of the chaff, to dropping \nchaff and seeds into tram-tracks behind the header that can then be targeted for burning or \nherbicides. The option for using this approach has been explored in the cotton system but \nhas limited value. Few of the winter weeds that could be captured by a header are \nsufficiently problematic in cotton to justify the expense of HWSD. Application of this \napproach to cotton pickers is not effective as relatively few weeds retain their mature seed \nuntil picking, although in reality, most fields are relatively clean at picking, with few weeds \npresent at this time. In addition, the HWSD approach has its own challenges and for \nmanaging annual ryegrass, HWSD is failing over time. Ryegrass plants are adapting to this \nselection pressure (developed resistance) by shedding their seed before harvest, steadily \ndiminishing the value of HWSD. So, while this approach can have value, in the long-term, it \ncan’t be relied on as a primary tool for weed management. \n30 \n \n2) Long fallows with full weed control \nLong-term fallows have been an effective tool in the south for greatly diminishing the seed \nbank of problematic weeds. Problematic paddocks might be left bare for 1 to 2 years to \nexhaust the seedbank, with weeds such as annual ryegrass having a seedbank life of little \nmore than 1 year. This approach can have great value in cotton systems, but in reality, is \nalready a standard component of most cotton farming systems, which generally include a \nsummer fallow following cereal crops, may include a winter fallow after a sorghum crop or \ncotton crop, depending on autumn rain, and a long fallow from a cereal crop back to cotton. \nAdditionally, many of the problematic weeds of the cotton system have longer seedbank \nlives, such that their seedbanks aren’t exhausted by a 1 or 2 year fallow, and in some cases, \nsuch as cowvine, thornapple and Noogoora burr, a 2 year fallow will do little to diminish the \nseedbank. \n3) Strategic cultivation \nStrategic cultivation is an important tool that should be part of the cotton system, used to \ntarget problematic weeds, such as perennial weeds that persist through routine shallow \ncultivation, and to bury surface germinating seeds of species such as sow thistle and \nfleabane. Strategic cultivation should be a component of all dryland cotton systems, used as \nnecessary to manage problematic weeds. However, in the furrow irrigated cotton system, \nalthough cultivation may not be used specifically to manage weeds, it remains a standard \npractice used to maintain the flow of irrigation water along furrows, and is often used when \napplying fertilizer. Hence, for the majority of the cotton industry, the system is one of \npermanent beds and minimum tillage, with light tillage remaining an important component of \nthe system. \nOne of the more recent changes to the cotton system was the removal of the mandatory \nrequirement for a pupae busting cultivation pass after crop harvest. This change in practice \nraised the question as to how much the pupae busting pass may be contributing to weed \ncontrol in the cotton system. An experiment was established at Narrabri in 2014 by Dr. \nSudeesh Manallil to determine the effect of cultivation following picking on the weed \npressure in a continuous cotton system. The experiment was a split plot, with cultivation as \nthe main-plot, imposed soon after picking or prior to planting. Main plots were 70 m by 4 m \nand replicated 4 times. Main plot treatments were: \nFallow tillage Timing   \nLilliston (light cultivation) Following picking (Early Lilliston)  \nPrior to planting (Late Lilliston) \nGo-Devil (heavier disc cultivation) Following picking (Early Go-Devil)  \nPrior to planting (Late Go-Devil) \nCentre-busting & sweeps Prior to planting (Centre bust) \nNil - (Nil) \n \nAcross this design was imposed weed control approaches, with plots 10 m by 4 m, \nreplicated twice within each main plot (8 replications). The treatments were: \nAt-planting In-crop  \nGlyphosate \nFluometuron Glyphosate \nFluometuron Glyphosate + hand chipping \n31 \n \n \nPlots were also inter-row cultivated such that all weeds were controlled in crop. \nThis design was maintained for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. The experiment became \npart of the current project in 2016-17 and the weed control component of the design was \nchanged, with slight modifications of the existing treatments and inclusion of three additional \ntreatments, reducing each sub-plot treatment to 4 replications, as shown below. Inter-row \ncultivation was only used when necessary to maintain the irrigation furrows. These changes \nwere introduced as the original design had resulted in weed-free plots, not allowing the \nimpact of the cultivation treatments to be assessed. The modified design resulted in heavy \nweed infestations on some treatments, challenging the impact of fallow-cultivation strategies. \n \nAt-planting  In-crop  \n1 Fluometuron + pendimethalin (Pre-residual)   \n2 Fluometuron + pendimethalin (Pre-residual) Metolachlor + Envoke  (Residual) \n3   Glyphosate (Glyphosate) \n4 Fluometuron + pendimethalin (Pre-residual) Glyphosate (Glyphosate) \n5   Metolachlor + Envoke + \nglyphosate \n(Residual + \nglyphosate) \n6 Fluometuron + pendimethalin (Pre-residual) Metolachlor + Envoke + \nglyphosate  \nResidual + \nglyphosate) \nNote. Envoke is trifloxysulfuron-sodium. \nThe original main-plot cultivation treatments remained unchanged under the new design and \nthe experiment was continued for nine season through to the 2022-23 season and the \nmodified weed control design for seven seasons. Weed biomass was assessed mid-season \neach year. \nResults and discussion \nThere were variations in the results over time, however, analysis showed few consistent \ndifferences and few trends. A comparison of the cultivation treatments is shown below, \naveraged over the past 7 seasons. \n Herbicides Cultivation Weeds Lint yield \n At-planting In-crop  (g/m2) s.e.

Lint yield was \nsimilar on most treatments but was lower where there was no cultivation during the fallow \nphase. Although the trend was weak, there was evidence that a cultivation pass during the \nfallow phase improved weed control and lint yield. \nThe results averaged over cultivation tactics are shown below. \n \n33 \n \n Herbicides Weeds Lint yield \n At-planting In-crop (g/m2) s.e.

This contrasted with the first season where these \ntreatments were imposed (2016-17), when the field was largely weed-free and an \nassessment showed few weeds and no differences between the treatments. By 2017-18, \nafter just one season without in-crop glyphosate, high levels of weed biomass were recorded \non these treatments. The level of weed pressure recorded in 2017-18 remained consistent \nover the next 5 seasons. However, one of the issues of the experimental design was that \ndue to the small size of the sub-plots of only 10 m by 4 rows, weed seed was spread \nbetween plots and treatments by mulching and cultivation treatments. Hence mulching and \ncultivation tended to reduce the concentration of weeds on the more heavily infested plots, \nspreading weeds into clean plots. Without this effect, it seems likely that weed pressure \nwould have been higher on these treatments by the end of the experiment. \nA higher level of weed control was achieved where glyphosate was used in-crop (Treatment \n3), and still better weed control where glyphosate was combined with residual herbicides \n(Treatments 4-6). The early-season, over-the-top in-crop application of metolachlor + \nEnvoke was very effective in controlling weeds through much of the season, resulting in very \nlow levels of weed pressure on these plots, however, Envoke is no-longer available in \nAustralia. \nIt was anticipated that the Nil and light cultivation treatments would become dominated by \nperennial weeds over time, but this didn’t happen, except for nutgrass. Partly this was just \nthe result of chance, as weed spectrum tends to vary between most fields and seasons. This \nfield did not have a background population of perennial species. The nutgrass density did \nbuild over time on the treatments that didn’t include glyphosate but didn’t become \nunmanageable, probably because the nutgrass was being exposed to applications of \nglyphosate during the fallow period between each cotton crop. This was a further \ncomplication of the trial design, where glyphosate was necessarily applied over all \ntreatments during the fallow phase to manage weeds during this time, as cultivation was not \na tool available to control these weeds, since fallow cultivation was a main treatment. Again, \nhad winter weed management been only imposed by the fallow cultivation treatments, the \nexperiment would have given a different result, but would have also quickly become \nunmanageable. Instead, weeds were managed in the fallow using glyphosate, as is the \nnormal practice in the industry. \nOverall, the experimental area remained relatively clean of weeds throughout the trial period \nand cultivation and herbicide tactics had little impact on the cotton yield, with yields similar \neven on plots with higher weed pressure. The only treatment that stood out over the 7 \nseasons was the herbicide combination of at planting residual herbicides (pendimethalin and \nfluometuron) and in-crop glyphosate (Treatment 4), arguably an industry standard treatment. \nThe average yield on Treatment 4 of 11.2 bales/ha was 0.8 bales higher than the treatments \nwhich achieved poorer weed control (Treatments 1 & 2).  \n34 \n \nConclusion \nStrategic cultivation is an important weed management tool that should be part of all cotton \nproduction systems. Cultivation should be used strategically as a double-knock to control \nherbicide resistant species, to manage hard-to-control perennial weeds, and to bury seeds of \nsurface germinating species. A cultivation pass in-fallow between cotton crops will aid with \nweed control and may help maintain crop yields. Cotton growers should include a fallow \ncultivation pass in their system, ideally aiming to use the pass to restore irrigation furrows \nand incorporate fertilizer as well as help manage perennial and other weeds, ideally using \nthe cultivation pass as a double-knock backup to a herbicide application. \n4) Targeted weed removal  \nSpot spraying, hand hoeing and hand removal of low densities of herbicide resistant weeds \nhas become a targeted approach in some grain systems to remove the last weeds from a \nfield. This approach has proven valuable, especially for removing low densities of resistant \nwild radish from cereal crops, as the flowers of these weeds can easily spotted in the crop. \nThese tactics were commonly used in the cotton industry prior to the introduction of \nglyphosate tolerant cotton varieties and remain a valuable backup for cotton growers to \nmanage low densities of large and difficult to manage weeds. Targeted weed removal should \ncontinue to be a minor, but valuable tool in the weed control tool bag. \n5) Cropping rotations \nRotation crops remain a valuable component of the cotton system, enabling a range of \nalternative herbicides to be used to control weeds, as well as other pests and diseases. \nRotations can also create fallow opportunities to control weeds over both summer and \nwinter. However, herbicides used in fallows and rotations can also have their own challenges \nwith potential issues from herbicide residues, and weeds can be difficult to manage in some \nrotation crops, such as broad-leaf weeds in broad-leaf crops. \nAll things considered, the common cotton system practice of rotating cotton and wheat, \ncreating a summer-fallow opportunity, continues to be a practical option for managing weeds \nin the system. \n6) Crop Competition \nResearch over many years in the grain’s space has shown the value of narrower row \nconfigurations and increased crop density for increasing crop competition and thus \nsupressing weeds. While these approaches are being increasingly used in the rotation crops \nin the cotton system, they have little direct application in cotton. Reducing row spacing, \nultimately to ultra-narrow row configurations, has been tried in cotton but has not proven to \nbe advantageous. Standard seeding rates, of 12-15 seeds/m are already above the optimum \nand further increases would not improve crop competitiveness. \nNevertheless, cotton growers do all that they can to promote early-season crop growth, \nclosing the rows and achieving competitive crops as early as possible in the season. Cotton \ngrowers use precision planters, seed treatments etc. to minimise gaps in cotton rows, use \nwater management, pesticides and fertilisers to promote crop growth, and delay planting \nuntil temperatures are suitable when possible to promote rapid crop emergence and \nestablishment. All these practices are employed to promote crop growth and crop \ncompetitiveness. Generally, cotton varieties also produce a larger, more competitive plant \n35 \n \nlater in the season than was the case in the past, but on the down side, many of the newer \ncotton varieties are small seeded, with poorer seedling vigour, sometimes contributing to \nless competitive crops with gappy stands and slower early-season growth.  \n7) Cover crops \nA variation of the crop competition tactic for weed control is to use a cover crop, either in the \nfallow pre-cotton, or in the cotton crop. Cover crops are routinely used prior to cotton, if not \ndirectly, then by way of cereal crops grown prior to a cotton crop, with the standing stubble \nretained as long as possible, thus providing cover. This is not generally done for weed \ncontrol, but the retention of cereal stubbles does give some advantage in weed control, as \nwell as advantages including improved moisture retention and protection from sand blasting. \nCover cropping prior to planting is being trialled in the NT and appears to bring many \nadvantages. \nCover crops are not used within cotton crops, as they would compete too strongly with \nrelatively uncompetitive cotton seedlings. \n8) Delayed sowing \nA valuable strategy for managing winter weeds in cereals has been to delay sowing – \ninstead of sowing as soon as possible after the autumn rains, allowing the flush of weeds \nstimulated by these rains to be controlled before planting. This strategy should be applied in \ncotton production as much as possible, where the dirtiest fields are pre-irrigated and planting \nis delayed as long as possible to allow the subsequent flush of weeds to be controlled before \ncrop emergence. In practice, the use of cotton varieties with the Roundup Ready Flex trait \nhas allowed cotton growers to apply a glyphosate at or soon after crop emergence to \nremove the first flush of weeds, ensuring the crop establishes in a clean seedbed. \n9) Autumn tickle \nThe autumn tickle is a modification of the delayed sowing tactic, where a cultivation pass \nfollowing the rains of the autumn break stimulates a flush of weeds that can be controlled \nbefore planting occurs. This tactic may have value in the future cotton system where weeds \nsuch as herbicide-resistant feathertop Rhodes, windmill, awnless barnyard grass and annual \nryegrass become increasingly troublesome. The tactic might involve pre-irrigating a field and \ncontrolling the emerged grass with one or even two light cultivation passes, maybe the \nsecond pass as part of the planting operation. It would be valuable to undertake research to \ndetermine if this approach could significantly reduce emerging populations of these grasses. \n10) Robotic weeders  \nRobotic weeders certainly have a place in the cotton farming system of the future and are \nideal for targeted weed removal. Robots should become far more common in the cotton \nsystem over the next decade. Robotic detection and management of larger weeds in fallows \nis being achieved, but detection of weeds in crops is very challenging and yet to be reliably \naccomplished, such that the use of robotic weeders is limited to fallows and the “bare” area \nbetween crop rows. Also, to date, these systems are still employing herbicides as the means \nof weed control. Consequently, their use is not assisting with managing herbicide resistant \nweeds and the use of high herbicide rates through robots to control large weeds can lead to \nissues with herbicide residues for following crops. \n36 \n \nWork by others has explored the practicality of using these platforms to control weeds using \nother tools, including microwaves, steam and lasers, but these tools can require large inputs \nof energy, struggle to control large weeds, and are not effective for controlling most \nperennial species. The value of robotic platforms will remain limited until an effective non-\nherbicidal tool is developed to control weeds and green-on-green weed detection is \nestablished. \n11) Drone sprayers \nThe use of drones to detect and manage weed infestations in cotton systems has much \npotential but suffers from the same limitations as robotic weeders, with the additional \nlimitations of short flight times (when compared to cotton fields that may be hundreds of ha \nper field) and the challenge of “spot” herbicide applications, where the “spot” may be around \n2 m in diameter of more. Drones will have a lot of potential in the cotton system when they \ncan employ green-on-green detection technology and can be paired to robotic weeders, \nenabling these weeders to efficiently move from weed to weed. \nConclusion \nMany of the weed management tactics used in the grains system have value for cotton \nproduction, and most of these are already being utilized in cotton, or preceding crops or \nfallows. \nThe main advances for the cotton system in the future are likely to be around robotics and \ndrones with green-on-green detection, together with non-herbicidal weed-control tools. \nResearch in this area continues, with robots and drones now proven technology, albeit with \nfurther advances to be expected over the next decade. Refinements can be expected in \ncombining these technologies and fully-automating the technologies. Accurate green-on-\ngreen detection, coupled with an effective non-herbicidal means of weed control remains a \nbig hurdle at this time and field application of this technology is still to be validated. \n \nThe potential use of cultivation to control herbicide resistant weeds after pre-irrigation should \nbe further explored. Assuming that grasses resistant to glyphosate, paraquat, the grass \nherbicides (Group 1) and glufosinate become more widespread over the next decade, \ndelayed planting and early-season removal of emerged seedlings by light cultivation may \nbecome a valuable tactic for reducing the numbers of these and other weeds. The potential \nto stimulate the emergence of these weeds through pre-irrigation and light cultivation should \nbe explored. \n  \n37 \n \n \nMilestones 3.1 and 3.2 – Undertake targeted resistance surveys in weeds in the \ncotton farming system. + Screen weed seeds for resistance to glyphosate, \nglufosinate, paraquat and Group A chemistry \n \nBackground \nHerbicide resistance has an increasing presence in the Australian cotton industry. \nGlyphosate resistance in awnless barnyard grass, and feathertop Rhodes grass is becoming \ncommonplace in fields throughout the cotton growing regions. Resistance to other \nherbicides, particularly the group 1 (A) herbicides, is now starting to appear as growers look \nfor other options besides glyphosate to control grasses. Glyphosate resistance has also \nplaced increasing pressure on paraquat, the most common second knock partner in double \nknock applications. This is due to the likelihood that weed populations may contain biotypes \nthat are resistant to glyphosate. As a result, paraquat is the only applied herbicide that can \nprovide effective control as part of the double knock. Survivors of the paraquat application \nthat are then able to produce seed, have an increased risk of developing resistance. \nThe aims of these milestones were to conduct targeted weed surveys across the cotton \nindustry to collect samples that would then be screened for resistance to glyphosate \nparaquat, group 1 herbicides and glufosinate. This will enable us to determine how \nwidespread resistance is to these herbicides. \n \nMethods and materials \nSource of seeds \nTargeted weed surveys were conducted throughout the cotton growing regions of \nQueensland and New South Wales from 2019 to 2022. The QDAF team collected seed \nsamples including feathertop Rhodes grass, awnless barnyard grass, windmill grass and \nsowthistle from the Darling Downs region in 2019 and 2020. Seeds of feathertop Rhodes \ngrass and awnless barnyard grass populations from New South Wales were collected via the \nCotton Info network in 2020 and samples from the Queensland border region, St George \nand Goondiwindi were collected by Andrew McKay in 2021. The QDAF team also collected \nsamples of feathertop Rhodes grass, purpletop Rhodes grass (Chloris inflata) and awnless \nbarnyard grass from the Theodore, Moura and Emerald cotton growing regions in March \n2022. \n \nHerbicide Screening \nThe screening of grasses for resistance to commonly used herbicides was conducted at the \nLeslie Research Facility in Toowoomba. Screening of broadleaf samples was conducted at \nCharles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga. The herbicides used are listed in Table 1. \nAll plants were sprayed using a research track cabinet sprayer using DG95015EVS nozzles \nat 30 psi delivering 114 L/ha of water. The herbicide rates were determined to deliver a \ndiscriminating dose that represented the herbicide label. As the timing of the herbicide \napplication was at the 2-3 leaf stage, where relevant, the lower end of the label rate was \nused. \n38 \n \n \nTable 1. Herbicides and rates used for resistance screening of summer grasses. \nHerbicide Active  Rate \nRoundup UltraMax Glyphosate (570 g/L) 1.44 L/ha \nGramoxone Pro 360 Paraquat (360 g/L) 1.1 L/ha \nVerdict 520 Haloxyfop (520 g/L) 100 mL/ha \nSequence Clethodim (240 g/L) 250 mL/ha \nBasta Glufosinate (200 g/L) 3.75 L/ha \n \nSeeds from each population were placed into individual take-away food containers, \ncontaining approximately 100 ml of a 0.6% agar solution for germination. Containers were \nthen placed into a growth room with a 30/20°C day/night temperature and 12hrs light. After \napproximately one week when the seedlings were between the cotyledon and 1-leaf stage, \nthey were transplanted into larger trays filled with a mixture of potting mix and sand to \nensure good contact of the mixture with the seedling’s roots. \nEach tray contained two populations scheduled to be sprayed with the same herbicide. \nThere were up to 50 seedlings from each population transplanted, a total of up to100 \nseedlings per tray. The trays were then placed either in the glasshouse or growth room (in \nthe winter months) with the moisture kept up so that trays were continually moist and not \nwaterlogged. Once the seedlings had reached the 2-3 leaf stage (approximately two weeks \nlater) the respective herbicide treatments were applied. \nAfter herbicide application, trays were then placed back in the glasshouse/growth room. \nSurvival counts were conducted 28 days after herbicide application. \nHerbicide Assessment \nPopulations with over 30 seedlings established at the time of spraying, were able to be \nassessed for herbicide resistance. This methodology is used for resistance screening in \nother GRDC projects. Populations with fewer seedlings were still sprayed and survival data \nrecorded. If there were between 20-30 seedlings sprayed, the data could still be recorded \nbut not reported on unless sprayed on multiple occasions to confirm results. For less than 20 \nseedlings, data was not used in reporting. \nThe resistance status of each population was grouped into 3 classes: 1. 20% or more \nsurvivors – resistant; 2. 1-19% survivors – developing resistance; and 3. Less than 1% \nsurvivors – susceptible. \n \nResults and discussion \nA total of 100 grass samples were collected across the cotton regions. The samples \nconsisted of 57 awnless barnyard grass, 40 feathertop Rhodes grass, 1 windmill grass and 2 \npurpletop Rhodes grass. Of these populations, 4 BYG and 1 FTR were not included in any \nresistance testing due to germination failure (Table 2). \nA large proportion of the seed collected did not germinate in sufficient quantity to be included \nin the results. The highest failure with germinations was with the awnless barnyard grass \npopulations were there was a 30-67% failure to germinate/survive transplant across the \nherbicide treatments. This is compared to a failure rate of 5-36% with the feathertop Rhodes \ngrass populations. \n39 \n \n \nTable 2: The total number of species and populations collected across the regions and included in the \nherbicide resistance tests. \nWeed species Darling Downs \nsamples \nNSW Cotton \nInfo samples \nBorder Rivers \nsamples \nCentral Qld \nsamples \nAwnless barnyard grass 4 40 7 2 \nFeathertop Rhodes \ngrass \n8 1 15 15 \nPurpletop Rhodes grass 0 0 0 2 \nWindmill grass 1 0 0 0 \n \nOf the 16 awnless barnyard grass populations tested for glyphosate, one population was \nresistant with another population developing resistance (Table 3). Four other populations \nindicated resistance to glyphosate however in these populations less than 30 plants were \nsprayed, and therefore require further testing. Most populations were susceptible to \nhaloxyfop with three populations having some survivors. Clethodim had two populations that \nwere resistant with one population having some survivors and the remainder susceptible. \nResults with glufosinate and were less ideal than expected, with several populations either \nbeing resistant or developing resistance. Screening with glufosinate and paraquat was \nconducted with plants growing in the growth room over winter (to get through the \npopulations). Both herbicides rely on photosynthesis and therefore light (photons) to rupture \ncells in the plant. The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the growth rooms is \napproximately 400-500 μmol m-1 s-2 compared to 2000 μmol m-1 s-2 in full sunlight. As the \nlikelihood of previous exposure to glufosinate of all populations in low, it is expected that \ncontrol would be higher in full sunlight. \n \nTable 3. Awnless barnyard grass populations screened to each herbicide and number of resistant \n(>20% survivors), developing resistance (1-19% survivors) and susceptible (no survivors) populations. \nResults show populations with ≥ 30 plants sprayed.

Three \npopulations tested resistant to haloxyfop with another population requiring further testing. An \nadditional five populations were classed as developing resistance. Results from clethodim \nwere also worse than expected, although it is important to note that the lower label rate of \nclethodim was used, and that the higher rate may have controlled more populations. \nHowever, results on previous experiments in CQ indicate that the effectiveness of clethodim \non feathertop is questionable. The effectiveness of glufosinate and paraquat was also lower \nthan expected, however these populations were also grown in the growth room, so the \n40 \n \nproblems encountered with light also contributed. Some of these populations were retested \nand proved to be susceptible. It is considered unlikely that all of these populations would test \nas resistant, which indicates that the growing conditions have affected the results. Ideally \nwith no time constraints we would like to retest all populations under external conditions. \n \nTable 4. Feathertop Rhodes grass populations screened to each herbicide and number of resistant \n(>20% survivors), developing resistance (1-19% survivors) and susceptible (no survivors) populations. \nResults show populations with ≥ 30 plants sprayed.

Again, the growing \nconditions were mostly likely not conducive to those herbicides. \n \nTable 5. Windmill grass populations screened to each herbicide and number of resistant (>20% \nsurvivors), developing resistance (1-19% survivors) and susceptible (no survivors) populations. \nResults show populations with ≥ 30 plants sprayed. \nHerbicide No. populations \nsprayed \nResistant \n \nDeveloping \nresistance \nSusceptible \nGlyphosate 1 0 0 1 \nHaloxyfop 1 0 0 1 \nClethodim 1 0 0 1 \nGlufosinate 1 1 0 0 \nParaquat 1 0 1 0 \n \nThe purpletop Rhodes grass collected tested generally susceptible to the range of herbicides \nwith one population that had 20-30 plants sprayed indicating resistance to glyphosate. There \nwere survivors from one population to glyphosate, haloxyfop and paraquat. The other \npopulation had survivors from clethodim. \nThe prevalence of glyphosate resistance in awnless barnyard grass and feathertop Rhodes \ngrass appears to have increased. Our results indicate that all barnyard grass populations \nappear to be resistant to one herbicide. For feathertop Rhodes grass, there appears to be \nthree populations from CQ that are resistant to both glyphosate and haloxyfop. The mixed \nresults from glufosinate and paraquat confuse the issue somewhat. However, it is expected \nthat these populations will be able to be controlled by those herbicides. The feathertop \npopulations that survived clethodim had not died at the time of the assessment. However, \nthey were stunted and did not appear to have any new growth after the clethodim \napplication. Screening conducted by the GRDC project showed that at the higher rate of \nclethodim feathertop Rhodes grass populations were controlled. \n41 \n \nWe are starting to see increased pressure on the glyphosate alternatives throughout all \nregions. This also places increased pressure on double knock applications, as resistance \nmeans that the first application of glyphosate or group 1 herbicides is becoming largely \nineffective. The result is increased pressure on paraquat and glufosinate as the follow-up \nherbicides. This is likely to result in an increase in the incidence of paraquat and glufosinate \nresistance on these species. \nTable 6. Purpletop Rhodes grass populations screened to each herbicide and number of resistant \n(>20% survivors), developing resistance (1-19% survivors) and susceptible (no survivors) populations. \nResults show populations with ≥ 30 plants sprayed.

Weed samples \nwere sent to Wagga and the sowthistle, windmill grass and feathertop Rhodes grass (FTRG) \nsamples tested. \n Fifteen samples of windmill grass were screened for resistance to glyphosate and all were \nresistant. Six populations were resistant to haloxyfop and clethodim. Three populations of \nbarnyard grass were tested for herbicide resistance and all were resistant to glyphosate, \nclethodim and haloxyfop. The feathertop Rhodes grass samples were all resistant to \nglyphosate and clethodim, however, in a promising sign only one population was resistant to \nhaloxyfop. Potentially, we have some chemistry still available in the Group 1 mode of action \nthat is working on some of the summer grasses. The low numbers of individual populations \nreflect poor germination from collected samples a reflection of the wet conditions during \ncollection time. \nThe results from herbicide resistance testing have been extended to the cooperating REO’s \nand agronomists. A comprehensive weed survey across all cotton valleys will be undertaken \nduring the 2021-22 season. \nScreening of sowthistle samples to glyphosate and 2-4,D was undertaken from the 10 \nindividual populations collected in 2021-22 season. Four of the nine populations are resistant \nto glyphosate and five of the populations are resistant to 2-4,D with one population in each \nherbicide developing resistance. \nA study was conducted on the effect of under dosing with glyphosate or ‘hormesis’ on \nbarnyard grass and paraquat on tall fleabane populations. The low doses can stimulate \nbiomass accumulation in resistant biotypes which leads to the development of herbicide \nresistance. Above ground biomass accumulation increased significantly in resistant \npopulations of both weeds, meaning that the resistant populations have a fitness advantage \nand eventually will become dominant over the susceptible plants in the field. \n42 \n \nMilestone 3.3 – Phenology studies on emerging weeds, identifying potential \nweaknesses to target control \nMilestone 3.3.1 – Effect of moisture stress on the development and time to \nmaturity for feathertop Rhodes grass (Chloris virgata)  \nBackground \nThere is limited scientific information available on the effect soil moisture has on the growth \nand development of feathertop Rhodes grass (Chloris virgata). Anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat feathertop matures quicker when under stressed conditions. An experiment was \nestablished under growth cabinet conditions to investigate research questions pertaining to \nthis statement in relation to water stress. \nIn particular: \n• Are there any significant differences in growth and development parameters of \nfeathertop Rhodes grass (FTR) based on field/water capacity? \n• How does FTR respond to water stress in relation to time to maturity? \n• Is seed production and viability impacted by water stress? \n \nMethods and materials \nGrowing conditions \nThe experiment was conducted in a growth chamber so that the temperature, water capacity \nand day length could be controlled. A temperature regime of 30/20 °C with a photoperiod of \n12 hrs was chosen to mimic the growing conditions for feathertop Rhodes grass during the \ncotton growing season. \nSeed collected from a population of feathertop Rhodes grass during a survey in April 2022 of \ncentral Queensland cotton farms was used in this experiment. Six field capacities (% FC) \nranging from no stress to high stress were applied (100, 75, 50, 37.5, 25, 15) with 6 \nreplicates for each treatment. Pots were randomised within each replicate, and replicates \nwere randomised within the growth cabinet. Replicates were re-randomised around the \ncabinet every two weeks to account for temperature and humidity differentials in the cabinet. \n \nSoil moisture calculations \nAn initial test was conducted to determine the field capacity of the soil being used in the \nexperiment. Six pots (165 mm diameter x 175 mm deep) were filled with 2500 g of black \ncracking clay from the Hermitage Research Facility at Warwick. Pots were lined with paper \ntowel prior to adding the soil to limit moisture loss. The soil in the pots was saturated with \nwater and after draining for 24 hrs, weighed and then oven-dried at 50 °C for 3 days and \nreweighed. The measurements for the saturated soil and the dry soil were averaged and \nused to calculate field capacity for the Hermitage soil (Boyd & Van Acker 2003).  \n \nCalculations were then made to determine how much water had to be added to the \nexperimental pots to bring each to the required field capacity. \n \nExperimental procedure \nExperimental pots were watered-up to their respective percent of field capacity and placed in \nthe growth cabinet where they were monitored and weighed daily for a period of three days. \nSeeds of feathertop Rhodes grass were pre-germinated in take-away containers containing \napproximately 100 ml of a 0.6% agar solution. Up to five healthy seedlings with root lengths \n43 \n \ngreater than 1 cm were transplanted into the individual pots and the soil lightly moistened to \nensure seedling survival. Water stress treatments were imposed 10 days after transplant \nwith seedlings being culled back to one plant/pot and individual pots being brought up to \ntheir respective field capacity. During early plant growth pots were watered back to their \nrespective field capacity three times/week (Mon, Wed, Fri) and as the plants developed, \ndaily watering was required to maintain the desired field capacities.  \n \nThe growth and development measurements recorded included: \n• time to tillering, booting (the boot stage is the time the seedhead is enclosed within \nthe sheath of the flag leaf), panicle production, pollen production and maturity \n• tiller and panicle production \n• dry weight biomass at maturity (above and below ground) \n• seed production and seed viability \n \nAs the plants matured, seed was collected daily from individual plants and placed into \nrelevant seed packets. Seed production was calculated by counting 1,000 seeds from three \nplants, weighing each and then calculating an average weight/1,000 seeds. Individual seed \ncollections were weighed, divided by the calculated seed weight, then multiplied by 1,000 to \nobtain a seed production value. \n \nSeed viability study \nSeeds (100 seeds x 3 replicates) from each plant were then incubated at 30/20 °C on a 12 \nhr day/night regime. Seeds were placed in 9 cm Petri dishes with a layer of filter paper (No. \n1: Whatman International, Maidstone, UK) and 3ml of deionised water. Up to 9 Petri dishes \nwere placed into Ziplock bags to retain moisture and make daily counting of germinated \nseed easier.  \n \nResults \nGrowth and development \nFor all analyses the average number of days (time) for plants to reach each successive \ngrowth stage was calculated from the date of transplant. \nThe first development stage, the time taken for seedlings to commence tillering, was \ninsignificant across all field capacity (FC) treatments (p = 0.588) and ranged from 17 to 29 \ndays. The 15% FC treatment was included in this development analysis as all seedlings had \nproduced tillers. \nThe average time for plants to commence booting was significant (p<0.001) as was the \naverage number of tillers produced before booting (p=0.002) across the treatments (Fig 1a & \n1b). \n44 \n \n \nFigure 1. a) The average number of days for the seedlings to commence the booting stage of \ndevelopment for each field capacity treatment. b) The average number of tillers produced per plant up \nuntil the booting stage commenced across the field capacity treatments. Bars with different letters for \neach respective moisture regime are significantly different (p < 0.05). \n \nAt 25% FC plants took significantly longer to boot (88 days) compared to treatments with \nhigher field capacities (51 – 63 days) (Fig 1a). Additionally, plants in this treatment produced \nsignificantly fewer tillers prior to booting compared to plants with higher water availability (Fig \n1b). \nPanicle production was measured as the time taken for the first panicle on each plant to \nemerge from the booting sheath. Both time to panicle production and time to pollen \nproduction were significant (p<0.001) across treatments (Fig 2a). The time taken to reach \nmaturity was also significantly different across treatments (p<0.001) (Fig 2b). \ndead\na\nb\nc bc bc\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n15 25 37.5 50 75 100\nAverage no. of days to booting\nField capacity (%)\ndead\na\nb b\nb\nb\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n15 25 37.5 50 75 100\nAverage no. of tillers at booting\nField capacity (%)1b\n1a \n45 \n \n \nFigure 2. a) Average number of days to the onset of panicle production and additional days to pollen \nproduction across the field capacity treatments. b) Average number of days to the onset of maturity \nacross the field capacity treatments.

Average seed viability was the highest (68%) for \nplants grown at 50% FC compared to plants with the lowest viability (34%) grown at 25% \nFC. However, some plants in the 25% FC treatment did produce seed with higher average \nviability (75%) than plants grown under higher field capacities.  \n \nDiscussion \nThis initial research shows that the amount of soil water available to feathertop Rhodes \ngrass seedlings has a significant effect on growth and development parameters. \nPlants grown at 50% field capacity were the quickest to mature (67 days) and produced the \nmost panicles, averaging 62 panicles/plant. While seed production was lower than that of \nplants grown at 75% field capacity, viability was slightly higher at 68% compared to 61%. \nHowever, in relation to plant biomass, plants in this treatment produced significantly less \nbiomass when compared to plants grown with higher water availability. Results indicated that \nat 50% field capacity the plants were putting more effort into reproductive growth rather than \nbiomass production. While plants subjected to the highest water stress (15% FC) died before \nmaturity they did tiller and produce above-ground biomass.  \nWith regard to root length, plants grown at 75% and 100% field capacities had the longest \nroots averaging 36 - 37cm, significantly longer than all treatments, including plants grown at \n50% field capacity (27 cm). Across all treatments, the roots took advantage of what moisture \nwas available in the soil and developed accordingly. \nRegardless of the amount of soil moisture available, plants in treatments with a field capacity \nof 25% and above survived to produce viable seed. While plants grown at 50% and 75% \nfield capacity produced on average over 9,000 viable seeds/plant, the viability decrease in \nseeds produced at 100% FC resulted in plants producing an average of 6,620 viable seeds.  \nThis experiment has provided interesting information on how feathertop Rhodes grass \nresponds to soil moisture stress. It appears that the plants optimal development occurs \naround 50% field capacity and decreases with lower and higher water availability. To further \ninvestigate the impact of soil moisture availability on feathertop, this experiment will be \nrepeated in 2023 to confirm and expand on our existing knowledge.  \n \n49 \n \nMilestone 3.3.2 – 1) Determining base temperatures for red pigweed and dwarf \namaranth. 2) Emergence and persistence of red pigweed seeds \nBackground \nUnderstanding the triggers for emergence and growth of weeds is important to determine \nwhen they are likely to emerge in the field and identify potential weaknesses to target for \ncontrol. Red pigweed (Portulaca oleracea) and dwarf amaranth (Amaranthus macrocarpus) \nhave been present in cotton and grain fields for many years. However, numbers have been \nrelatively low, but the presence of both species has been steadily increasing. Both species \nare prolific seed producers, producing small seeds, indicating that they are primarily surface \ngerminators. However, both have hard seeds, indicating that they could be quite persistent, \nand their continued presence in-field is a strong indicator of this characteristic. Therefore, an \nunderstanding of the temperature requirements for germination and emergence, and their \npersistence relative to burial depth is important. \nThe base temperatures for red pigweed and dwarf amaranth were determined in addition to \na separate experiment focused on assessing the impact of seed burial on seed bank \nemergence and persistence of red pigweed seed in the soil. The research question was the \nemergence patterns and persistence of red pigweed. \nRed pigweed is an annual, succulent herb germinating late spring to summer, with flowering \nand seed set occurring in summer. Being a succulent type weed, control of larger plants is \ndeemed to be difficult and there have been reports of reduced control using herbicides. Little \nis known about the ecology and seed-bank dynamics of red pigweed and this part of the \nstudy investigated the effect of seed burial on the emergence and persistence of red \npigweed over time.  \n \nMethods and materials \nBase temperature determination \nSeeds (50 seeds x 3 replicates) of each species were incubated at eight different constant \ntemperature regimes (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 38oC), and a 12-hr day/night regime. The \nhighest temperature of 38oC was due to limitations in the incubator that prevented it reaching \nthe desired maximum temperature of 40oC. Seeds were placed in 9 cm Petri dishes with two \nlayers of filter paper (No. 1; Whatman International, Maidstone, UK) and 10 ml of deionised \nwater. The number of germinated seeds was recorded daily for at least 28 days, and \nrecordings stopped when no further germinations were observed for 7 days. The tests were \nrun twice in different incubators for each temperature regime. \nMinimum temperature thresholds, and the reciprocal time to 50% germination were \nestimated according to Steinmaus et al. (2000). Percentage germinations for each replicate \nwere fitted to the logistic function: \n \nY = min+(max-min)/(1+(x/T50)^(-Hillslope)),     (1) \n \nwhere Y is the percentage of cumulative germination, X is the time (days), the germination \nrate (T50) is the time taken for half of the seeds to germinate, and Hillslope is the steepness \n50 \n \nof the curves.  This was calculated using R version 3.6.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical \nComputing). \nA linear regression was then performed by plotting the inverse of the germination rates \nagainst each incubation temperature.  The base temperature (Tb) was then determined by \nwhere the regression intercepted the temperature axis. \nEmergence and persistence of red pigweed \nAn 18-month pot trial was established in a shade house (10% shade cloth) at the Leslie \nResearch Facility, Toowoomba in July 2021 and designed to run until January 2023 \ninvestigating the impact of five burial depths (0, 1 ,2, 5 and 10 cm) and five exhumation \ntimes (3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months) on emergence and persistence of red pigweed seeds. \nSeed used was collected in March 2020 from mature plants growing on the edge of cotton \nfields around Nandi, Queensland. \nThe experiment was designed as a randomised complete block with 3 replications. Pots \nwere placed on 3 benches with each bench being a separate replicate. A total of 84 pots, \nincluding 9 control pots with no weed seed added, were filled with unsterilized heavy black \ncracking clay collected from Hermitage Research Facility, Warwick. The 9 control pots were \nincluded in the design to determine the possible background red pigweed population in the \nsoil. The average emergence across these pots was less than one, indicating that the \nbackground population in the soil was negligible. \nUsing 200 mm pots (20 cm diameter x 17 cm depth), soil was added in such a way to create \na soil/seed layer that could be exhumed for seed persistence measurements. Permanent \nmarks were made on the interior of all pots at the soil surface level. Further measurements \nwere taken from this level down into the pots to identify where seeds needed to be placed. \nMarks were made at the burial depth and at 2 cm below this depth (1, 2, 5 and 10 cm) and at \n2 cm above the burial depth (5 and 10 cm only). No additional marks were required for the 0 \ncm pots. \nSoil was added up to the 2 cm below mark in all pots, except the 0 cm treatments, and \ncovered with a shade cloth disc to establish a soil/seed layer for future exhumations. An \nadditional 2 cm of soil was placed on the disc to bring the soil surface up to the seed burial \nmark. A total of 150 red pigweed seeds were then spread over the soil surface in the centre \nof the pot. An additional 2 cm of soil was added over the seeds except for the 1 cm \ntreatment where 1 cm of soil was added. In the 5 cm and 10 cm treatments another layer of \nshade cloth was added at the 2 cm above mark and then filled to the surface mark with the \n0cm burial depth having seeds spread across the surface. \nExisting irrigation lines were removed from the benches to ensure pots received rainfall \nwithout any impediment and that no additional watering occurred. Rainfall was recorded after \neach event using a rain gauge set up in the vicinity of the pots. Pots were checked for \nemergences on a regular basis, especially after a rainfall event and once recorded, all \nemergences were removed.  \nThe number of seeds persisting in the soil at exhumation (3,6,9,12,18 months) was \ndetermined via recovery of the soil/seed layer. Due to the small size of the red pigweed seed \n(0.5 to 0.8 mm) seeds that failed to germinate were not recovered for further testing. The \nsoil/seed layer from each pot was transferred into individual trays (35 x 28 cm), with the soil \nbeing spread evenly over a base of potting mix approximately 2 cm in depth. Trays were \nrandomised and placed within existing reps in a growth room at 30/20°C (12-hour day/night \ncycle) for a period of 3 months to provide conditions suitable for seed germination. \nEmergences were recorded on a regular basis with seedlings removed from the trays once \ncounted. Soil was dried out before being scratched up and re-watered to potentially bring \n51 \n \nburied seed closer to the surface and allow further flushes. This was not done with the 18-\nmonth trays due to time limitations. These trays were kept in the growth room for only 5 \nweeks and scratched up and re-watered on a weekly basis. After a week with no flushes the \nexperiment was terminated. \nIn conjunction with the persistence experiment, an experiment was run to investigate how \nseed viability changes over time. This was assessed by measuring the change in viability of \nstored seed samples. Eighteen specimen bottles, each containing 150 red pigweed seeds, \nwere prelabelled with an exhumation month (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 months) and replicate number \n(1 to 3). The bottles were stored in a dark environment (paper bag inside of a shoe box) at \nambient temperature, in this case a shed in the shade house.  \nThe stored seed was assessed for viability via germination tests in conjunction with each 3-\nmonthly pot exhumation. At each exhumation the stored seed was placed into 9 cm Petrie \ndishes with a layer of filter paper (No. 1: Whatman International, Maidstone, UK) and 3 ml of \ndeionised water. The Petrie dishes were put into Ziplock bags and placed into the growth \nroom with the trays. Germinations in the Petri dishes were counted for a period of 28 days in \norder to determine a comparison between the viability of the seeds in dry storage compared \nto seed in the pots at each exhumation time. \n \nResults and discussion \nBase temperature determination \nRed Pigweed \nRed pigweed was able to germinate at a wide range of temperatures (10oC – 38oC) (Figures \n1 and 2). There were no germinations at 5oC. The lowest germinations occurred at 10oC \n(20%) and the highest at 25oC (70% and 50% in runs 1 and 2 respectively). These maximum \ngerminations occurred within 5-7 days of incubation, indicating that when exposed to \nmoisture and the right temperature they are quick to germinate. \n \nFigure 1. Proportion of germinated red pigweed seeds with respect to time and temperature. The \ngraph on the left is from Run 1, and on the right is from Run 2. \n \nWhen the time to 1/50% germination was plotted against temperature for the two runs, the \nresultant equation was y = 0.046x – 0.495. This corresponded to a base temperature for red \npigweed of 10.75oC. \n\n52 \n \n \nFigure 2. Inverse of time to 50% germination plotted against temperature for red pigweed. The \nregression equation is y = 0.046x – 0.495 with the x-axis intercept and base temperature at 10.75oC \n(R2 = 0.75). \n \nDwarf Amaranth \nThe temperature requirements for dwarf amaranth were slightly higher than that of red \npigweed. There was no germination below 15oC, with only 10% of seeds germinating at this \ntemperature. The highest germinations occurred at 25oC (70%) in run 1 and 35oC (60%) in \nrun 2 (Figure 3). The germination response time was slightly slower than that of red \npigweed, with the maximum reached after approximately12-13 days after incubation. \n \nFigure 3. Proportion of germinated dwarf amaranth seeds with respect to time and temperature. The \ngraph on the left is from Run 1, and on the right is from Run 2. \n \nWhen the time to 1/50% germination was plotted against temperature for the two runs, the \nresultant equation was y = 0.017x – 0.179. This corresponded to a base temperature for red \npigweed of 10.6oC. \n\n53 \n \n \nFigure 4. Inverse of time to 50% germination plotted against temperature for dwarf amaranth. The \nregression equation is y = 0.017x – 0.179 with the x-axis intercept and base temperature at 10.6oC \n(R2 = 0.84). \n \nIt is important to note that sometimes when working with equations, the end result can be \ndifferent from what is expected from the data. This was the case for the base temperature of \ndwarf amaranth, as its base temperature was similar to that of red pigweed although there \nwere no germinations for dwarf amaranth below 15oC. Perhaps some germination would \nhave occurred at 11 or 12oC. However, both species were similar in the temperature range \nrequired for their germination. Dwarf amaranth has a slightly larger seed than red pigweed, \nwhich explains the longer time required for its imbibition and subsequent germination. These \nresults indicate that both species can germinate as soil temperatures rise above 10oC which \nis likely to occur early spring. They will then be able to germinate through summer into \nautumn. Their hard seed coats also indicate that they will emerge in scattered cohorts \nthroughout the season. Both these factors combine to explain why they are continuing to be \na problem. \nEmergence and persistence of red pigweed \nRed pigweed is a very small seeded species (0.5 – 0.8 mm), and therefore we would expect \nit to primarily emerge from the soil surface. This was reflected in the results obtained from \nthis experiment (Figure 5). Most seeds germinated from 0, 1 and 2 cm depths and were \nsignificantly greater than emergences from 5 and 10 cm throughout the experiment. \nEmergences from 0 and 1 cm depths were significantly greater than 2 cm in the 3 and 12-\nmonth pots. Both exhumation times corresponded with cooler seasons, winter/early spring (3 \nmonths) and autumn/winter for the 12-month pots. Red pigweed is known to germinate from \nlate spring to summer with seeds remaining dormant over the winter months. Sufficient \nrainfall (148.5 ml) had been received at the commencement of the experiment to ensure \nemergence from surface-sown and 1 cm seeds with the onset of warmer conditions. Over \nthe first 9 months of the experiment a total of 1146.5 ml was received followed by another \n322 ml in the next three months and 407 ml during the final 6 months of the experiment.   \nAs pots for later exhumation times were left in the shade house emergences tended to \nincrease. This was the case particularly for the 1 cm depth pots, although this effect was not \nsignificant as the bulk of emergences occurred within the first 3-6 months. Although red \n\n54 \n \npigweed emergence was favoured by the shallower depths, it is interesting to note that some \nemergences did occur from 5 and 10 cm. In similar research, germination was greatest for \nsurface sown seed and declined up to a depth of 1 cm with no emergences at 2 cm. While \nthis contrasts with results obtained in this experiment, research undertaken on common \npurslane (red pigweed) by Benvenuti et al. (2001) found that seedlings emerged from up to 6 \ncm in depth but not beyond. This shows that red pigweed still can emerge from depth, \nhowever weed management practices such as cultivation that can bury the seed to depths of \n5 cm or more will significantly reduce emergence. \n \nFigure 5. Emergence of red pigweed in relation to burial depth and time. Bars with different letters for \neach respective depth and exhumation time are significantly different (p < 0.05). \nThe other factor to consider with burial depth is persistence. It is expected that as burial \ndepth increases, so does persistence. This was the case with red pigweed in this study \n(Figure 6). \nFor seed buried at the lower depths up to 2 cm, most of the viable seeds remaining in the \nsoil germinated after the initial 3-month burial period. Seed sown on the surface had the \nlowest persistence, decreasing over time with negligible germinations after 18 months. Seed \nburied at 1 cm persisted longer than that on the surface, decreasing from a viability of 19% \nafter 3 months to approximately 3% still viable after 18 months. After 3 months, seed buried \nat 2 cm had a viability of 32% which decreased at a slower rate ranging 5-10% from 6 \nmonths to 18 months. Seed buried at 5 and 10 cm persisted significantly longer than \nsurface-sown, or seed buried to a depth of 1 cm. The highest geminations occurred from \nseed buried at 10 cm and exhumed after 12 months. Seed buried at this depth had similar \ngerminations when exhumed at 9 months as seed exhumed at 18 months. This indicates \nthat seed can persist at 10 cm for extended periods and this study provided no clear \nindication of when the persistence of red pigweed seed buried at this depth will decline. At all \nexhumation times, seed buried at 5 cm were statistically the same as those buried at 10 cm. \nIt does appear that there is a decline in persistence of seed buried at 5 cm after 18 months, \n\n55 \n \nhowever again this study was not conducted for long enough to determine when persistence \nwill substantially decline. \n \nFigure 6. Persistence of red pigweed seeds in relation to burial depth and length of burial (measured \nat germinations from each exhumation time). Bars with different letters for each respective depth and \nexhumation time are significantly different (p < 0.05). \nSeed that was stored in the shade house reached its peak gemination after 3 months, \nfollowed by 0 and 6 months. After 18 months there were still significant germinations with \njust under half of the seed stored germinating (Figure 7). \nThe times in this study were set to correspond to the exhumation time in the pot study in the \nshade house. However, these seeds were collected approximately 18 months prior to \nestablishing the study. After collection in the field, seeds were stored at room temperature, \nprior to establishing the experiment. This ultimately means that these seeds were stored for \nup to 36 months. This provides some indication of their persistence. If we attempt to \ncombine the results from the stored seed to that of the seed placed in the soil at 10 cm, we \ncan estimate that seed would need to be buried for at least 36 months (3 years) before \npersistence would begin to decline. \ngh\nijk jk jk jk\ndef\nfg gh\nhij hij\nbcd\nghi\nfg gh efg\na\nab\nab\nab\ncde\nab\nbc\nab\na\nbc\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n3 6 9 12 18\nCumulative emergence\nExhumation time (months)\n0 cm\n1 cm\n2 cm\n5 cm\n10 cm\n56 \n \n \nFigure 7. Total emergence of red pigweed seed stored at shade house temperature and germinated \nin petri-dishes with respect to each exhumation time. Bars with different letters for each respective \nexhumation time are significantly different (p < 0.05). \nThe management strategy for red pigweed is not a simple one. In order to reduce the \npopulation, it appears that leaving the seed on the surface and applying a range of pre- and \npost-emergent herbicides to reduce emergences and then control subsequent emergences \nis a viable option. Our results indicate that this would need to be done for at least 18 months \nto 2 years. Cultivation can also be a viable option, however once seed is buried it would \nneed to remain buried for at least 3 years or more. Otherwise seed buried at depth that is \nthen brought up to the surface will be able to emerge. This contrasts with weeds like \nfeathertop Rhodes grass and fleabane where persistence drops after two years. The burial \nstrategy might be more useful when targeted to fields where red pigweed is the major weed \nof concern. \n  \n\n57 \n \nMilestone 3.3.3 – Determining if summer growing annual ryegrass is a new biotype of \nthis weed \nBackground \nAnnual ryegrass has been the primary weed of southern winter cropping systems, competing \nstrongly with cereal crops, and has developed resistance to most of the herbicide modes of \naction used to manage this weed. Much of the southern management of this weed focuses \naround harvest weed-seed capture and destruction, but plants are developing “resistance” to \nthis tactic, emerging later in the season to escape pre-planting and at-planting inputs, \ngrowing more quickly, and maturing before cereal harvest, shedding their seed before \nharvest and thus avoiding harvest weed-seed capture. This “plasticity” of annual ryegrass \n(ability to grow differently to “evolve” to avoid weed control tactics) is fundamental to why this \nweed is so problematic in southern farming systems. \nGlyphosate resistant annual ryegrass has become a common weed of the southern cotton \nsystem and plants are spreading into the more northern areas. Resistant annual ryegrass \nhas been common on the Liverpool Plains for many years and is now becoming problematic \non the Darling Downs, although generally, the annual ryegrass encountered in the cotton \nsystem is relatively easily managed, although all is resistant to glyphosate. \nOne grower from the Macquarie we spoke to during the 2016 industry workshops \ncommented that he had annual ryegrass on a property in the Macquarie that was resistant to \nall his in-cotton grass herbicides other than metolachlor. This was not confirmed but \nresistance to other herbicides is likely to be a future problem with annual ryegrass as it has \nbeen elsewhere in the south. \nA concerning new development from the southern cotton areas is that some annual ryegrass \nis now growing in cotton throughout the summer, moving from being a winter weed problem \nto become a serious summer weed! \nThis experiment was established to determine whether this summer growing annual \nryegrass is a new summer-growing biotype of annual ryegrass, or whether this is just a \nreflection of the plastic nature of this weed finding opportunity for plants to survive through \nthe summer. \n  \nAnnual ryegrass growing in cotton in summer at Darlington Point. \nA paper discussing this question was published in 2022, but does little to answer the \nquestion: Thompson M & Chauhan B (2022) Changing seasonality of Lolium rigidum (Annual \nryegrass) in Southeastern Australia. Frontiers in Science, 4, \ndoi.org/10.3389/fargo.2022.897361 \n\n58 \n \nContinuity of our research was lost with challenges using growth cabinets that malfunctioned \nand turnover in staff. Some intended treatments were not completed. \n \nMethods and materials \nSeed was collected from plants that grew and set seed over summer from several sites at \nDarlington Point, Whitton, Leeton and Forbes. Unfortunately, only the seed from Darlington \nPoint was viable. The growth of seedlings from this population was compared under \nglasshouse conditions with the growth of winter growing seedlings from the Namoi Valley; \nBullawa Creek, Boggabri and Breeza. Plants were observed and growth was measured \nduring the spring of 2020 and the senescence of these plants was recorded. There were \ninitially 28 plants from each source, with one plant per pot. Destructive harvests were \nundertaken on 10 pots during the observation period. Following senescence, seed was \nreturned to each pot and pots were monitored to observe the start of the following \ngermination. The established plants grew through the following season. \nSeed was again collected from the second season for germination testing in controlled \ntemperature cabinets to be tested for germination under constant temperatures of 10, 20, 30 \nand 40oC, with comparisons of germination rate between the different sources (some seed \nwas lost to mice). However, when tested, none of the four cabinets (two germination \ncabinets and two growth cabinets) owned by the weeds group were functioning correctly. \nThese cabinets had been purchased under the 2nd Cotton CRC and their electronic controls \nhad never been satisfactory. The controls on one had since been replaced at great expense, \nbut this cabinet was also not working. A local electrical company undertook to replace the \ncontrols with a much simpler system. This conversion took nearly 12 months to complete, \nwith only two of the four cabinets working satisfactorily at the end of the process. Seed was \nstored it 4oC during this period. \nFor each temperature, 25 seeds from each pot were placed on moist filter paper in Petrie \ndishes, with 4 replicates from 4 pots from each source. The seed from 40oC was lost when \nthe cabinet used for this temperature failed. The experiment was resumed when another \ncabinet became available but the seed was no longer viable. No cabinet was able to reliably \nachieve the 10oC temperature, leaving results only from 20oC and 30oC. \nResults and discussion \nResults for growth and development of plants from each source under glasshouse conditions \nare shown below. \n \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n0 54 69 74 81 89 96 109 161\nPoint Farms - summer type planted 28 May 20\nLeaf no./p Height (mm) Dry weight (g*10/p)\n59 \n \n \n \n \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n0 16 28 36 43 56 108\nPoint Farms - summer type planted 20 Jul 20\nLeaf no./p Height (mm) Dry weight (g*10/p)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n0 81 96 101 108 116 136 188\nBullawa Ck - winter type\nLeaf no./p Height (mm) Dry weight (g*10/p)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n0 81 96 101 108 116 136 188\nBoggabri (1) - winter type\nLeaf no./p Height (mm) Dry weight (g*10/p)\n60 \n \n \n \n  \nPlants established from seed from Point farms, taken from summer growing plants, planted \n28 May, grew more rapidly and were larger than plants from the other sources, growing to \n492 leaves/plant and biomass of 32 g/plant at senescence.

Of particular interest, the seed from Point Farms, sourced \nfrom a summer growing population, had a similar germination percentage and germination \nrate when compared with seed from the other sources, with all seed germinating as readily \nfrom 30oC as it did from 20oC. \nThese experiments did not detect any real differences between “summer growing” and \n“winter growing” types of annual ryegrass, although only one viable source of summer \ngrowing seed was used. However, the experiments did highlight the variable nature of \nannual ryegrass, a known characteristic of this weed. A reasonable conclusion from this \nwork is that there is not a “summer growing” biotype of this weed, but rather the “selection \npressure” of irrigated summer cropping in areas where annual ryegrass is prevalent, has \nextended the growth range of this weed, with plants increasingly able to grow at any time of \nthe year as opportunity allows. The practice of relying primarily on glyphosate for weed \ncontrol has resulted in this glyphosate-resistant weed becoming increasingly common in the \ncotton area. \nIt is also noted that annual ryegrass, as a winter-growing weed, is steadily moving north, \nbecoming a common weed of winter cropping on the Darling Downs, an area where it was \nnot previously found. It must be expected that annual ryegrass will spread as a summer \nweed over the next few years. It can be expected to become a common weed of cotton \nproduction and will be most problematic if populations resistant to the commonly used \nherbicide groups become established. Annual ryegrass has a long history of developing \nresistance to the herbicide groups and management practices used to manage it. \nIt is recommended that future herbicide resistance surveys include summer growing \nryegrass to monitor the development of herbicide resistance in this weed in the cotton \nsystem. \n  \n63 \n \nMilestone 3.3.4 – Assessment of black roly-poly (Sclerolaena muricata var. muricata) \nand soft roly-poly (Salsola australisa) as problem weeds for cotton production \nBackground \nThe roly-polys are prolific and abundant weeds of the western areas, occurring in high \nnumbers throughout much of the grazing country and around the edges of cotton fields. \nThey are minor weeds of fallows and can occur in cotton. \nDuring the last drought, it was reported that roly-poly was not being controlled by normal \nfallow sprays and was becoming problematic in fallows, although it was not clear as to which \nof the species was causing the issue. \nThis research aimed to determine some basic ecology of these weeds and their tolerance to \nthe commonly used herbicides of the cotton system. \nContinuity of this research was lost with challenges using growth cabinets that malfunctioned \nand turnover in staff. Some intended treatments were not completed. \n \nMaterials and methods – soft roly-poly \nSeed was collected from plants found on and around the Cotton Research Station at Myall \nVale. The rate of germination was tested in a germination cabinet at 15oC and two batches \nof seeds were tested on the surface of pots in a glasshouse at 20–30oC, with 25 seeds per \nsample and 4 replications. \nSixty germinated seedlings were transferred to pots in a glasshouse and grown for 100 days, \nat which time they were sprayed with herbicide as shown below. Four pots were allocated to \neach treatment, with destructive harvests on additional untreated pots at the time of \nspraying. Pots were selected to achieve relatively uniform size across treatments. Plant size \nwas recorded at spraying, and 4, 31 and 65 days after spraying. All alive plants were \ndestructively harvested at 65 days, with measurements recorded. \nTreatment Herbicide Herbicide rate \n(x/ha) \n1 Basta 1 L \n2 Basta 2 L \n3 Basta 4 L \n4 Dicamba 700 143 g \n5 Dicamba 700 285 g \n6 Dicamba 700 570 g \n7 Roundup Ready Herbicide 0.75 kg \n8 Roundup Ready Herbicide 1.5 kg \n9 Fluometuron 900 3 kg \n10 Prometryn 900 2.5 kg \n11 Diuron 900 2 kg \n12 Untreated  \n \nResults and discussion – soft roly-poly \nMost soft roly-poly seed germinated without the need for additional treatment. Germination \nwas tested on seed from two sources. Seed collected from the road side at Myall Vale \nachieved 60% ± 5% at 15oC, with average germination taking 4.1 ± 0.4 days from planting. \nSeed from a second collection achieved 62% ± 7% germination at 15oC, with average \n64 \n \ngermination taking 2.2 ± 0.4 days. Seed planted on the surface of pots in a glasshouse at 20 \n– 30oC achieved 50% ± 5% germination in 5.3 ± 0.1 days. \nGerminated seeds were transferred to pots, one plant per pot, and grown in the glasshouse. \nAt 100 days after planting, plants were still quite small at 9.8 ± 3 cm tall, with 12 branches \nper plant, weighing 0.7 g/plant. Plants were sprayed 100 days after planting, with results \nshown below. \nTreat Herbicide Rate 31 DAS 65 DAS \n   % Alive % Alive Biomass \n(g/plant) \n1 Basta 1 L 100 100 5.2 \n2 Basta 2 L 100 100 3.5 \n3 Basta 4 L - - - \n4 Dicamba 143 g 25 25 1.0 \n5 Dicamba 285 g 50 50 1.2 \n6 Dicamba 570 g 25 25 0.7 \n7 Roundup 0.75 kg 100 100 7.4 \n8 Roundup 1.5 kg - - - \n9 Fluometuron 3 kg - - - \n10 Prometryn 2.5 kg - - - \n11 Diuron 2 kg 25 - - \n12 Untreated  100 100 8.7 \n \nSoft roly-poly plants were killed by standard rates of Basta, Roundup Ready Herbicide, \nFluometuron 900, Prometryn 900, and Diuron 900. Dicamba 700 at rates up to 570 g/ha \ndidn’t kill soft roly-poly, but did suppress this weed, with no growth recorded at the highest \nrate, 65 days after exposure, and little growth at the lower rates. Interestingly, a lower rate of \nRoundup Ready Herbicide didn’t control or even supress this weed. \nThese results show that soft roly-poly is a surface germinating weed that can readily \nestablish under zero tillage, but it has a slow growth rate and is easily controlled by many of \nthe common herbicides that can be used with cotton production. Actively growing plants of \nsoft roly-ploy are readily controlled by a full rate of Roundup Ready Herbicide, but plants \nwere unaffected by a half-rate. It can be conjectured that stressed plants, and plants that \nreceive a lesser dose of glyphosate (possibly plants on the edge of a camera-spray \napplication) are likely to survive a glyphosate application, leading to the apparent issue of \nroly-poly survival observed during the drought. It seems likely that soft roly-poly seedlings \nwill be readily controlled by any of the standard residual herbicides used in cotton. \nMaterials and methods – black roly-poly \nSeed was collected from plants found on and around the Cotton Research Station at Myall \nVale. The rate of germination was tested in a germination cabinet at 15oC and in a \nglasshouse at 20–30oC, at 0, 5, 10 and 15 mm depth, with 25 seeds per sample and 4 \nreplications. \nSixty germinated seedlings were transferred to pots in a glasshouse and grown for 71 days, \nat which time they were sprayed with herbicide as shown below. Four pots were allocated to \neach treatment, with destructive harvests on additional untreated pots at the time of \nspraying. Pots were selected to achieve relatively uniform size across treatments. Plant size \n65 \n \nwas recorded at spraying, and 15 and 28 days after spraying.

Even a full \nrate of Roundup Ready Herbicide killed only one of four plants and supressed growth by \n64% when compared with untreated plants. The best treatments were Basta at the 2 and 4 L \nrates, Prometyrn and Convoy, each giving 75% control and 95% or better reductions in plant \nsize 28 days after spraying. \nThese results show that black roly-poly is a shallow germinating weed that can readily \nestablish under zero tillage and is not easily controlled by any of the common herbicides that \ncan be used with cotton production. Stressed plants are likely to be even less affected by \nthese herbicides, but it is likely that the cotton residual herbicides, especially prometryn, will \ncontrol emerging black roly-poly seedlings in cotton. Sensitivity to 2,4-D and fluroxypyr were \nnot tested in this experiment, but it may be that these herbicides are normally controlling \nblack roly-poly in fallows. \nThese results suggest that the observed issue of roly-poly being poorly controlled in fallows \nduring the drought is likely to have been a combination of the high tolerance of this weed to \nmany common herbicides, together with moisture stress, reducing the weed’s susceptibility \nto these herbicides. \nIt is concerning that black roly-poly is tolerant of most of the commonly used herbicides and \nis a very wide-spread weed, apparently being primarily controlled by cultivation and 2,4-D \n(conjecture at this time). Thus, there appears to be significant selection pressure for this \nweed to develop resistance to 2,4-D. Resistance to 2,4-D could make this a challenging \nweed of the future, potentially like the tumble weed of North-America. \n  \n67 \n \nMilestone 3.3.5 – Phenology and germination studies on feathertop Rhodes grass \nA comprehensive phenology study of four populations of FTRG interaction with 4 sowing times \n(4 Sep, 4 Nov, 4 Jan and 4 Mar) has been completed at Wagga Wagga. The results showed \nthat the mid-summer emerged cohort had the longest reproductive period whereas the early-\nautumn cohort died before switch ing to a true reproductive stage due to cold stress.  Plants \nbetween growing condition varied from prostrate to upright. Mid -summer cohorts required \nslightly longer to achieve seed head formation and less time for seed maturity than those \ninitiated in early and late spring. \nAll the reproductive features were varied together by emergence time and population types. \nThe number of seed heads, spikelets, seed head biomass and reproductive biomass allocation \npattern and s eed production was different between populations and generally increased at \nmid-summer emerged cohort. Seed production was 10% and 70% higher at mid -summer \n(9,942 seeds/plant) cohort than late spring (8,000 seeds/plant) and early spring (3,240 \nseeds/plant) cohorts respectively. \nControlling seedlings prior to reproduction particularly in late-spring to mid-summer emerged \ncohorts will alleviate the negative effect not only in the present year but also in future. Because \nof the highest seed production of feath ertop Rhodes grass that emerged during these times \nin southern NSW. The fitness of four population has varied , but roadside populations appear \nbetter adapted than cropping populations. So, controlling bare ground infestation of feathertop \nRhodes grass is also critical to reduce the new infestation from fence-lines to cropping  \nFeathertop Rhodes grass seeds are generally available on the soil surface but may also be \nburied at varying depths under field conditions as a result of management operations. A seed \nburial study under glasshouse condition showed that seeds of this species can germinate from \n0 – 2 cm depth.  This seedbank can contribute significantly to the assembly of weed \ncommunities in cropping paddocks. Such buried seeds may affect post -dispersal s eed \npredation and decay.  \nSeed germination biology study of feathertop Rhodes grass evaluated under two treatments: \nyear of seeds collection and geographic locations. The result showed that both have significant \nimpact of viable seed production. The first cohort produced more viable seeds than second \ncohort (seeds collected in 2021 from same location). Germination and viability also \nsignificantly different between populations. This  indicates that Rhodes grass biotypes’ \ncharacteristics vary widely between ha bits and environmental conditions or combination of \nboth. \nA new publication for the Best Management Practice for control of feathertop Rhodes grass \nhas been printed and is available through GRDC. The update includes research data from \nnew residua herbicides and the inclusion of grazing as a control tactic in southern NSW. \n \n  \n68 \n \nMilestone 3.3.6 – Phenology and germination studies on cowvine \nA phenology study of one population of Cow vine interaction with 2 sowing times (13 Nov and \n22 Jan) was conducted under na tural condition. The results showed that there was no \nsignificant difference between two sowing times in terms of date of seedling emergence, \nflowering date, seed maturity start date. However, number of branches and berry (seed pods) \nwas significantly higher in late emergence plants (22 Jan).  \nA scientific publication was accepted on the germination ecology and growth phenology of \ncowvine in Weed Science. \n  \n69 \n \nKey Objectives: \n• To determine how growers can better utilise residual herbicides in both dryland and \nirrigated farming systems by: \no Exploring issues with residual herbicides used in cotton, wheat, chickpeas and fallows, \no Exploring selected residual options in commercial irrigated northern and southern \nvalleys and dryland fields, \no Exploring potential issues with residual use from camera sprayers (high rates) and \nband-spraying behind header tracks where weed seeds are concentrated. \n• To determine what non-chemical strategies can be adopted to reduce the reliance on \nherbicides in cotton and grains systems by: \no Evaluating non-chemical weed control options developed in the grains industry. \nEvaluating the potential introduction into the non-cropping phase of cotton. \n• To determine the emerging and new weeds and resistance threats to the cotton industry \nby: \no Undertaking targeted resistance surveys of weeds in the cotton farming system in \ncollaboration with the GRDC surveys, \no Screen weed seeds for resistance to glyphosate, glufosinate, paraquat and group A \nchemistry, \no Undertake phenology studies on emerging weeds, identify potential weakness to \ntarget control. \n• To assist to achieve BMP for weeds in the dryland system by: \no Supporting dryland farming experiment at PBI with advice and monitoring support for \nthe Dryland Cotton Research Group, \no Supporting other dryland farming experiments with advice and monitoring support. \n• To determine what are the weed implications of cover cropping by: \no Supporting CCA cover cropping experiments with advice and monitoring support. \n• To input to the industry through the herbicide tech panel sub-committee of TIMS, grower \nmeetings, field days, meetings and conferences by: \no Providing ongoing technical support to industry, \no Updating the HRMS to include data on dicamba and glufosinate \n \n  \n70 \n \nBackground to research \nThe Australian cotton industry is considered a global leader in sustainable agriculture. \nHowever, herbicide resistance and problem weeds threaten the productivity and profitability \nof the cotton industry and the farming system. Over time, the industry is increasingly moving \nback to relying on residual herbicides to manage herbicide resistant weeds in cotton, in \nrotation crops and in fallows, with glyphosate now ineffective for controlling some grass and \nbroadleaf weeds, and resistance to the grass herbicides (Group 1) and paraquat also \nbecoming increasingly common. \nWith the increasing use of residual herbicides, comes the problem of crop safety to the \nfollowing crop, an even more difficult issue in dryland cropping, where rotations are often \ndetermined by planting opportunities, but selection of a residual herbicide applied in the \nfallow may restrict these options. The issues are further complicated by the increasing range \nof herbicides available for fallow use, with multiple herbicides potentially applied and multiple \napplications within a fallow period common. On top of this, camera sprayers are becoming \nstandard in the industry and it is common to apply higher than normal rates through these \nrigs. There is a big need to explore the potential for these herbicides and herbicide \ncombinations and rates to damage following cotton and other rotation crops. \nPrevious research has included surveillance of the herbicide resistance status of some of the \nmore problematic weeds in the cotton system. It is important that this work is continued to \ninform industry of developing issues and thus enable the industry to be proactive in its \nmanagement of herbicide resistance. In addition, targeted research will again be undertaken \non some of the emerging problem weeds to provide background information to assist weed \nmanagers in developing control strategies for these weeds.  \n \n  \n71 \n \nSummary of research \nThe primary research focus of this project was on the impact of residual herbicides applied \nto rotation crops and in fallows on the following cotton crops. Research was carried out over \na series of seasons (replicated in time), on replicated, randomised field experiments, some \nwith split-plot designs, in fields grown under typical commercial conditions. Components \nwere tested at Warwick (Southern Qld), Narrabri (Northern NSW) and Leeton (Southern \nNSW). The experiments were on solid plant, irrigated cotton, picked with modified \ncommercial pickers, and ginned to determine lint yield. Excessively wet conditions delaying \nherbicide applications and flooding in spring 2022 were challenging for some experiments. \nThese field experiments addressed the project’s objectives, producing results directly \nrelevant to the industry. However, the limitation of this work was that it could not test every \npotential herbicide, herbicide combination and application scenario. The largest of the \nexperiments (at Narrabri) examined eight in-crop herbicides in two rotation crops (wheat and \nchickpea) and 9 fallow herbicide combinations, a total of 80 treatments, with four \nreplications. While the findings from the results from this work are extremely valuable to \nindustry, a common scenario in the cotton system would be two in-crop herbicides and two \nor more fallow herbicides, increasing the potential herbicide combinations four-fold or more \n(as other herbicides could have been included). \nFuture research should focus on the impacts of some of the more common multiple-\nherbicide strategies. The current work, for example, showed that the standard cotton \nherbicides are not causing issues for the following rotation crops. However, only single \nherbicides were considered, applied at cotton planting. The potential impact of multiple \nherbicides, some applied pre-crop and others in-crop is yet to be examined, but is likely to \nbe damaging to rotation crops. \nFurther work is also needed to correlate herbicide soil and plant concentrations to crop \ndamage as we note that with more residual damage occurring in the industry and increasing \nconcern around damage from residual herbicides, there is currently no information that can \nrelate herbicide concentrations in soils or plants to damage. Where a grower sees damaged \nplants, it is becoming increasingly common to test for herbicide residues. When a herbicide \nis detected from a laboratory sample, it is assumed that the detected herbicide has caused \nthe damage. However, this may not be the case, and conversely, when no herbicide is \ndetected, this does not necessarily indicate that a given herbicide is not causing the \ndamage. We simply have no data to relate laboratory test results to plant damage and this \nneeds to be addressed. \n  \n72 \n \nOutputs from this work \nThis research has generated a bulk of experimental results that will be published in \ninformation sheets, articles and scientific papers, and delivered to industry through the \nCottonInfo network. \nThe research has generated data on: 1) crop growth reductions and lint yield reductions from \nresidual herbicides used in rotation crops, fallows, and through camera, 2) herbicide \ntolerance and resistance for a range of grass and broadleaf weeds in the cotton system, \nand 3) phenology and herbicide tolerance studies on six emerging weeds. \nAlready from this project there have been a series of scientific publications, articles, \nconference presentations, and many presentations at grower meetings. Most of these \nhave been documented below, although numerous lesser presentations were made. \nMore presentations and articles will follow.  \n  \n73 \n \nImplications of this work \nThis project had three main focuses: 1) exploring the impacts of residual herbicides, 2) \nscreening for emerging herbicide resistance threats, and 3) exploring the potential of \nemerging weeds. Each area has implications for the industry. \nOur research has highlighted: 1) that a) residual herbicides used in rotation crops, fallows, \nand through camera sprayers have the potential to seriously impact following cotton crops, \nreducing seedling vigour and lint yield, and b) combinations of herbicides can be more \ndamaging than expected, such that label crop-safety information may underestimate the \ndamage from combinations. \nHerbicide screening 2) showed that samples of awnless barnyard grass, feathertop Rhodes \nand windmill grass had some level of resistance to glyphosate, the Group 1 grass \nherbicides, paraquat and glufosinate. These levels of resistance have big implications for \nmanaging weeds. The resistance to glufosinate is surprising and unexpected and will \ndiminish the value of this relatively new mode of action herbicide to the cotton system, \nespecially if resistance occurs amongst broadleaf weeds. \nThe studies on emerging weeds 3) highlighted the challenges of managing some of these \nweeds, especially as they develop herbicide resistance. Cotton growers and consultants \nneed to be aware of these issues with these weeds and develop management strategies for \nfields where they become problematic. \nRecommendations around these issues are included in the report.  \n74 \n \n \nPublications \nCharles GW, Sindel BM, Cowie AL, Knox OGG (2019) The value of using mimic weeds in \ncompetition experiments in irrigated cotton.

A brief description of the purpose of the travel. \nThe purpose for attending the XXI N Workshop in person was to present the key findings from \nthe CRDC QUT Targeted N project in remote sensing for N optimisation and precision \nagriculture.  \nThe key findings presented at the workshop from the project include: \n1. Vegetative Indices (VI) can estimate differences in crop N status within management \nzones, \n2. A multivariate approach that considers soil moisture, canopy structure and soil \nbackground reflectance is required to accurately predict leaf N, petiole NO\n3-N and lint \nyield across the entire field, \n3. Sensor comparison has found that VIs derived from Sentinel- 2 provide similar results \nand reflectance patterns to the Crop Circle \n4. Sentinel-2 can therefore be used as a cost -effective source to estimate N status and \ninform N management decisions \n5. Future Farm will significantly improve the way in which soil and crop sensors are used \nto inform decisions about the amount and timing of N inputs to maximise productivity \nand profit \nIn 2021 I presented at INI2021 virtually and connected with Dr Jose Gabriel and Dr Jose -Luis \nPancorbo from the University of Madrid. I  also connected with their team during my visit to \nMadrid  (lead by Professor Miguel Quemada) and discussed  their research using hyperspectral \nband sensitivity for nitrate-N and their research us ing clip and handheld sensors. They are \nundertaking very similar research with clip sensors, however , in maize and winter wheat. We \nare using near infra-red sensors developed by Hone in cotton. \nThere was an opportunity to attend other key sessions that are important to the cotton industry. \nThe sessions were: \n1. Remote sensing for N optimisation and precision agriculture. \n2. Costs and benefits of halving N waste by 2030 \n3. N and circular economy. The role of affected stakeholders \n4. Policy Strategies for reducing N waste \nThe sessions all align nicely with the strategic RD&E plan goals of the CRDC. Attending  and \nparticipating in the meeting exposed me to the strategies implemented internationally to tackle \nN waste . It also made me aware of the policy frameworks  that could be  implemented in \nAustralian agriculture and the impact on our productivity as well as the role of circular economy \nresearch to assist in reducing waste. \n \n2. What were the: \na) major findings and outcomes \nThe major findings from the meeting were: \n 1. Considering the policy strategies for reducing N waste sessions: there is a major \nchasm between land managers and policy makers. The policy strategy session for reducing N \nwaste showcased a number of talks with sophisticated nitrogen budget modelling. There were \nsessions that modelled nitrogen budgets for urban and rural systems. A considerable number \nof presentations centred on segregated systems and did not consider a synergistic approach \nin their analysis.   \n 2. The remote sensing for N optimisation and precision agriculture session highlighted \nthat we are at the forefront in Australia when considering remote sensing research. The entire \nday dedicated to this topic p rovided an opportunity to hear about different methodologies of \npostprocessing of data collected from Satellite, Drone, Handheld and proximal sensors. There \nwas no clear technology to cover all applications.  \n \n \nUpdated June 2014  3 of 7 \n 3. N circular economy session highlighted the massive gap in understanding the overall \nemissions balance. I attended the circular economy field trip on the Wednesday (see Figure 2 \nin the appendix). The highlight from this session and field trip was the  lack of full accounting \nduring the processes. Considering the Madrid composting facility as an example illustrated that \nthere is a need to fully account for the whole circular economy process. The cities plant \nresidues (from pruning in parks and gardens) were trucked to the facility and past through many \nstages to be composted an d sieved to a desired fraction before being returned to the city \ngardens. The many process (from cartage, loader, mulching, composting, and sieving) all \nrequired fossil fuels and thus producing high emissions. The circular economy process, \nreturning  plant material back to the city gardens in a compostable form, required significant \nenergy inputs (fossil fuels) and processes (and not accounted).  \n   \nb) other highlights \n During the field trip we visited the “La Chimenea” field station (IMIDRA). The IMIDRA is the site \nwhere the research groups Agroecosystems Pollution by Agricultural Practices ( COAPA) and \nAgsystem’s (University of Madrid) undertake their field experiments in cover crop, permanent \ncrops and herbaceous crops and study emissions using the same greenhouse  gas sampling \nsystems (Appendix - Figure 3 – bottom right) we have used at Myall Vale with Professor Peter \nGrace. It was interesting to see the results from the research. Topsoil  incorporation of maize \nresidue was shown to reduce nitrous oxide emissions during the cover cropping phase.  \nIncorporation of vetch was also shown to reduce nitrous oxide emissions when compared to \nthe residues being removed. The residue incorporation was seen to tie-up the N in the system \nwhen incorporated. When removed it allowed the losses from the soil surface. We also visited \nanother site measuring ammonia losses using the micrometeorological integrated horizontal \nflux (IHF) method (Appendix - Figure 3). Low losses of ammonia were measured during heavy \nrainfall events after urea application and no differences in ammonia losses were found when \ncomparing Urea and Urea + urease inhibitors. \n \n3. Detail the persons and institutions visited, giving full title, position details, location, \nduration of visit and purpose of visit to these people/places. (NB: - Please provide full \nnames of institutions, not just acronyms.)  \nI met with a number of key people working in sensors.  \nDr Jose -Louis Pan corbo, Post -doctoral fellow  at ETSIAAB ( Higher Technical School of \nAgronomic, Food and Biosystems Engineering). Dr Pancorbo is working in field experiments \nevaluating the potential of spectral and thermal imagery to reduce environmental pollution by \nadjusting irrigation and fertilisation to meet crop requirements. He is working with a Dualex \noptical sensor and very similar to a SPAD meter. \nDr Jose Gabriel, Associated Researcher  and Senior Scientist  at INIA  (National Institute for \nAgriculture and Food Research and Technology. Dr Gabriel is an engineer and is working with \nField Spec  device (Spectroscopy) to determine nitrogen in Maize to improve NUE through \nbetter management using technology.  \nProfessor Miguel Quemada Saenz-Badillos, ETSIAAB (Higher Technical School of Agronomic, \nFood and Biosystems Engineering). Professor Quemada leads the team at the University of \nMadrid in the sensor engineering, working in N cycling in agricultural systems and application \nand decomposition of organic waste.  \nThe visit with the sensor team occurred during the conference. It was primarily setup to discuss \nthe relevance to our Future Farm project and sensors evaluated over the 4 years. We discussed \nthe Shiny app. that was developed in the Future Farm project, and it was encouraging to receive \npositive feedback that this something new to assist growers/consultants to utilise satellite \nimagery without the complex steps of post -processing required to access the data and \ninterpretation for field decisions. \n4. a) Are there any potential areas worth following up as a result of the travel? \nThere were a number of connections with colleagues working in policy  that would be ideal to \nconnect and sort  through the issues that may be coming to impact us in Australia. A key \nexample is the Dutch Policy to reduce nitrogen oxide and ammonia emissions by 50% by 2030. \n \nRevised July 2018  4 of 7 \n \nThis has resulted in protests from Dutch farmers blockading the Hague. The policy is seen as \nimpracticable by farmers that claim  it wi ll shut down their livestock enterprises. Another \nexample was from fertiliser subsidy policy implemented in S ri Lanka that  has impacted their \neconomy. The European Green Deal is another policy that has implications for Australia as it \ntargets no net emissions of GHG by 2050.  This would be worth following up with colleagues \nfrom the EU and how it effects agriculture.  I also attended the policy session with Dr Cameron \nGourley (current Oceania centre director for INI). We have kept in contact and will continue the \nconnection. I will continue to connect with the sensor team at the university of Madrid to keep \nabreast of any new and emerging technology. \nb) Any relevance or possible impact on the Australian Cotton Industry? \nThe main impact for the Australian Cotton Industry is the implementation of regulatory policy in \nregard to excess nitrogen (waste). If we see a regular occurrence of algal blooms in our rivers \nor waterways, for example, we may see these polices become reality for our industry . The \npolicies that are currently implemented in the European Union are having significant impacts. \nThe protests that have taken place in The Netherlands are one example of significant impacts \non farming through the implementation of emission policy. It is imperative that we as an industry \nreduce our N waste so that this does not occur in Australia. \n \n5. How do you intend to share the knowledge you have gained with other people in the \ncotton industry? \nThe intention is to share with the industry at several events like the Australian Ass ociation of \ncotton sc ientist in 2023 (Toowoomba) . I have also submitted an expression of interest to \npresent at the Crop Consultants Association meeting in Narrabri on the 26th and 27th July. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUpdated June 2014  5 of 7 \nAppendix \n \n\n \nRevised July 2018  6 of 7 \n \n \nFigure 1.

GHD is committed to learning from Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander peoples in the work we do.\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry i\n \nExecutive Summary \nThis report is subject to, and must be read in conjunction with, the limitations set out in section 1.4 and the \nassumptions and qualifications contained throughout the report. The approach to gathering evidence for the \nassessment relied on a range of methods, including desktop review, grower and community surveys, farm visits \nand targeted stakeholder consultation. Further detail on the assessment approach and methods are outlined in \nsection 2. It is important to note that like previous environmental assessments, GHD did not attempt to obtain a \nrepresentative sample of stakeholders in consultation activities, rather the intent was to hear from a diverse range \nof industry stakeholders, as well as those members of the community who wished to participate and share their \nperspectives. \nBackground \nIn 1991, cotton became the first Australian agricultural industry to conduct a full external examination of its \nenvironmental performance. Each decade since, the industry has re-committed to reviewing its environmental \nperformance by commissioning an independent assessment. GHD Pty Ltd (GHD) was engaged by the Cotton \nResearch and Development Corporation (CRDC) to complete the Fourth Environmental Assessment of the \nAustralian Cotton Industry. This assessment was undertaken between October 2021 and October 2022 and \ncovers the period since the Third Environmental Assessment, being 2013-2022. The delivery of the project was \noverseen by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) from CRDC and Cotton Australia, and the industry’s \nSustainability Working Group (SWG), which comprises membership from CRDC, Cotton Australia, CottonInfo, \nmyBMP, and the Australian Cotton Shippers Association. \nThe Terms of Reference for the Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton Industry were to: \n1. Assess the cotton industry’s response to the reco mmendations made in the Third Environmental Assessment \n(see Section 3.3.1) \n2. Identify current and emerging industry  environmental issues and their implications for the industry and on-\nfarm management. Policy developments, recognised global sustainability goals or initiatives, and industry and \nnon-industry stakeholder perceptions and expectations should be considered (see Section 4) \n3. Assess current industry action on environmental issues  in light of the Third Environmental Assessment and \nidentified environmental issues (see Section 5). This includes, but is not limited to: \na. Impact: if the industry’s on-far m environmental practices and outcomes are in line with current and future \nexpectations and trends  \nb. Responsiveness: how well industry bodies, the my BMP Program, CottonInfo and sustainability programs \nare aligned; how well is industry able to identify and respond appropriately to environmental issues \nc. Consideration of stakeholder concerns and percept ions of industry action to address environmental \nissues. Different perspectives should be considered e.g. cotton industry (gins, shipping), state \ngovernment, federal government, community and non-government organisations \n4. Recommend priorities for action based on the findings from 1, 2 and 3 above (see Section 6). \nThe environmental assessment was guided by an Assessment Framework (Appendix B), which was developed by \nGHD with input from the PSC. GHD conducted a desktop review of relevant literature, including sustainability \npublications, myBMP resources, and previous environmental audits and assessments. GHD also attended and \npresented at SWG (Sustainability Working Group) and ACSRG (Australian Cotton Sustainability Reference Group) \nmeetings. Separate stakeholder and grower questionnaires were undertaken (gaining 53 and 16 responses \nrespectively), as well as targeted stakeholder interviews and 25 on-farm site visits across four growing regions.  \n  \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry ii\n \nIndustry Response to Third Environmental Assessment \nThe Third Environmental Assessment was completed in 2012 by Inovact Consulting. The report summarised the \nmajor achievements of the industry in improving its environmental performance since the 2003 Environmental \nAudit. This was in the context of the industry facing environmental challenges, with greater complexity and \ndemands in terms of improving business productivity and profitability; global competitiveness and market \nexpectations of environmental stewardship; the policies, programs and regulatory requirements of government \nrelating to the environment; the long-term pressures on Murray-Darling Basin water resources and the prospective \nintroduction of a Murray-Darling Basin Plan; and public expectations for good environmental and social \nstewardship. The report summarised the major achievements of the industry in its environmental performance as: \nx Effective and responsible management of the industr y’s use of genetically modified cotton varieties \nx The substantial reduction in the use of chemicals pa rticularly insecticides and residual herbicides for \ncotton growing and the disappearance of serious off-farm impacts in rivers and wetlands \nx Major gains in water use efficiency in cotton growing calculated at three to four per cent per year and \neffective management and stewardship of water resources on-farm \nx Major advances in grower attitudes and action co ncerning natural resource management on farm and \nactive engagement in landscape and catchment wide natural resource management, particularly \nmanagement of deep drainage, riparian management, groundwater conservation and delivery of \necosystem services \nx Significant uptake of integrated pest management (I PM) and the link being established between IPM and \nbiodiversity conservation in terms of ecosystem services on-farm and at a landscape scale \nx Development of an integrated research, development and extension system that delivers priority research \nand development and extends this to growers through an online best management practices program \n(myBMP) and the extension activities of the industry’s key organisations such as Cotton Australia and the \ncommercial sector. \nThe Third Environmental Assessment identified nine priorities for industry and made six recommendations. A \nsummary of the recommendations and GHD’s assessment of the industry’s response are provided below.  \n \n2012 Recommendation Progress Comments supporting GHD’s assessment \n1. CRDC work with various stakeholders \nto develop a five-year RD&E strategy ضضضThe cotton industry has a number of strategic plans all of which have \nidentified environmental management and sustainability priorities. The \nCRDC Strategic Plan guides the industry’s RD&E investment and is \ncurrently being developed for a new 5-year period, and will align with \nthe PLANET.PEOPLE.PADDOCK. goals. \n2. Re-invigorating myBMP and re-\nappraise its role in industry assurance ضضRe-appraisal of myBMP occurred (recognised as being important for \ninternational marketing) but continued focus is needed on grower \nuptake. \n3. CRDC and Cotton Australia \ncollaborate on establishing an \naccurate up-to-date database of \ngrowers and industry organisations \nضضContinued effort is needed to maintain an up-to-date database of \ngrowers and industry stakeholders, and to drive their engagement in \nenvironmental management and reporting. \n4. Commission independent \nenvironmental assessments every five \nyears to determine longer term trends \nضضضCRDC and CA are committed to five yearly comprehensive reporting \nagainst sustainability targets, including environmental indicators, and \nannual snapshot reports/updates in the interim. \n5. Cotton industry value chain engages \nwith market based initiatives like \nBetter Cotton Initiative \nضضض The cotton industry continues to actively engage in market based \ninitiatives like cottonLEADS and Better Cotton. The industry has \nrecently embarked on the development of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry Strategic Roadmap with the aim of creating alignment \nbetween industry and customer needs.  \n6. Continue market research on \nperceptions of the cotton industry ضضض The ACSRG provides the opportunity to connect various stakeholders \nand gather insights and perceptions. The industry has undertaken a \nrange of other market research activities including through its Cotton \nto Market program and partnership in the Community Trust in Rural \nIndustries program. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry iii\n \nCurrent and Emerging Environmental Issues \nGHD reviewed a range of information sources and undertook consultation with various industry stakeholders to \nconsider the current and emerging environmental issues relevant to the industry and its on-farm management. We \nfound that the emerging drivers identified in the Third Environmental Assessment have continued to gather pace, \nwith public interest in environmental issues triggering a new swathe of international agreements and commitments, \nmore stringent market requirements, and a range of domestic policy and program responses relevant to the \nindustry’s operating environment. The implications for industry can be summarised as: \nx Industry improvement in environmental performance and reporting over time does not always align with \npublic perception. Water management and use remains a particularly contentious issue, and competition \nfor increasingly scarce water resources, particularly in the context of climate change, will continue to lead \nto public scrutiny in this area, along with increased regulatory pressures \nx The industry’s expansion into new growing areas wi ll create new Research, Development and Extension \n(RD&E) needs, as well as the need to engage with a new communities and stakeholders to maintain its \nsocial licence to operate \nx The industry is also facing increasing pressure to me et new expectations in its international markets, with \nthe need to keep up with international competitors in this area \nx Global markets are demanding increased transparency of environmental stewardship and sustainability, \nand there is also an expectation of greater ambition in target setting. Market assurance programs like \nmyBMP are likely to become a minimum requirement for some markets in the future \nx There is also an increasing demand at the internationa l level for product traceability to provide market \nassurance and counter the potential for ‘greenwashing’. Traceability however has the potential to provide \nnew opportunities for growers to connect with their end-users. \nThe Australian cotton industry has sound processes in place to identify and respond to current and emerging \nenvironmental issues, including through the implementation of an industry-wide sustainability framework, having \ncommenced sustainability reporting in 2014. Through its SWG, materiality scans are undertaken quarterly to \nidentify and consider current and emerging issues and their relevance to the industry’s sustainability agenda. As \nwas found in previous assessments, the industry is backed by a strong RD&E model and industry organisational \nstructure. The industry’s new Cotton to Market Strategic Roadmap and CRDC’s Digital and Data Strategy will be \ncritical in helping adapt to the identified current and emerging issues at least cost to industry.  \nCurrent Industry Performance and Recommendations \nGHD assessed the industry’s current environmental performance and progress since the previous environmental \nassessment in the areas of environmental management and reporting; water use and management; pest \nmanagement; agrichemical and petrochemical storage, handling and waste; natural resource management, \nincluding soils and biodiversity; and energy emissions and climate. Our assessment considered the industry’s \ncurrent priorities and key initiatives, on-farm practices and outcomes, and stakeholder concerns and perceptions \non specific environmental issues.  \nOur key findings and priorities for improvement are summarised below. \nEnvironmental management and reporting \nGHD found that the industry has made great strides in its environmental management and reporting systems in the \nten years since the Third Environmental Assessment. Together, myBMP, CottonInfo, PLANET. PEOPLE. \nPADDOCK. (overseen by the SWG), CRDC and Cotton Australia all have a role in this work and GHD found \nstrong alignment and clear signs of collaboration across the respective industry organisations. \nContinued industry effort is needed going forward to increase the awareness amongst growers and other industry \nstakeholders about the industry’s sustainability framework. While awareness around the industry’s myBMP \nprogram is relatively high amongst growers and stakeholders, the uptake of myBMP certification, and therefore the \nusefulness of the program in market assurance is still limited at levels of 25-30% of production. To achieve the full \nbenefits from the industry’s efforts in this area, growers themselves have an active role to play not only in \nenvironmental management on-farm, but in engaging with the industry’s sustainability agenda more broadly. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry iv\n \nIn terms of its on-farm observations, GHD found a positive correlation between the use of myBMP and improved \nenvironmental performance when aggregating findings across all farms visited and criteria considered. That being \nsaid, close to 90% or higher of the environmental criteria observed on-farm were ranked as ‘excellent’, ‘very good’ \nor ‘good’ across all growers, regardless of myBMP status indicating a strong level of on-farm environmental \nperformance was observed overall. \nGHD makes the following recommendations for further improvement in this area: \n1. Continue to undertake updates to the existing myBM P website to ensure all information is current and \nweblinks and video content are accessible. Regular updates to both the main website and module content \nshould be undertaken to ensure information remains current. This will become increasingly important as \nmodule content and supporting resources are updated to incorporate new research and information \napplicable to new growing areas. \n2. Continue to increase the transparen cy and consistency of reporting of the number of growers both registered \nand certified with the myBMP program. Subject to privacy considerations, this should include the total number \nof growers and/or farms, and the total area and/or volume of cotton produced by farms with myBMP \ncertification, both in aggregate and by region. This information should be available on the myBMP website as \nwell as reported in the relevant annual publications, e.g. the Better Cotton and Cotton Australia Annual \nReports. \n3. Ensure a whole-of-industry commitment to increasing the uptake of myBMP certification. This may require \nfurther research into identifying real and perceived barriers to uptake. Following this, there may be a need to \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive communications and engagement plan that incorporates regionally \nspecific adoption targets and actions for each of the supporting industry organisations. \n4. Evolution and possible transformation of the myBMP program is required over time toward a performance-\nbased tool that both adds value to participating farm businesses and provides clear outputs and data to \nsupport the implementation of the industry’s sustainability agenda. This could include considering if the \nplatform could be used to measure and monitor the stocks of natural capital at the farm scale. \n5. The sustainability framework and reporting process shoul d continue to move toward science-based targets, \nacknowledging the difficulties of achieving ambitious targets in a complex system. The SWG has already \nundertaken considerable work in this area and should be encouraged to continue. \nWater use and management \nWater use and management has been an area of considerable industry RD&E investment which has resulted in \ndemonstrable on-farm improvement over many years. GHD observed that water use was monitored thoroughly on \nthe farms throughout the cotton growing regions where on-site farm visits were undertaken. Most growers, \nregardless of myBMP status, were also found to take advantage of information from canopy temperature sensors, \nmoisture probes, on-farm weather stations, and software for irrigation scheduling. \nDespite this, water remains a highly contentious issue amongst stakeholders. Consistent with the previous \nassessment, water was rated as the highest current and emerging issue for the industry by both growers and \nbroader stakeholders throughout our consultation. Consistent with the level of public interest in water use, \ngovernments have and will continue to respond through a range of legislative, policy, and program initiatives. \nGovernments also have a role to play in the provision of information and data on the use of water resources in \nAustralia, including increasing the education and awareness of the regulation and compliance measures that are in \nplace for water extraction. \nIn addition to its ongoing RD&E efforts, the cotton industry will need to continue its engagement with the national \nwater reform agenda into the future, which will include the need for an ongoing focus on compliance (including \nmetering and monitoring) activities, implementation of floodplain harvesting policies and programs, expansion of \nirrigation in Northern Australia, and further implementation and review of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The issue \nof fish entrainment has also emerged in recent years as an environmental issue that the industry needs to further \nconsider given its implications for on-farm management. \nGHD makes the following recommendations in relation to water use and management: \n6. Continue to work with the respective government age ncies to include, where available, information on the \nstatus of water compliance in major cotton growing regions (e.g. number/size of breaches compared to total \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry v\n \nnumber of holdings) in industry sustainability reporting, as was flagged in the 2020 stakeholder consultation \nreport on the setting of industry targets and indicators for the Australian cotton industry. \n7. Continue to support research and trial work that is underway to better understand the impacts of fish \nentrainment and encourage broader adoption by cotton growers and infrastructure operators of screening on \nirrigation pumps and/or other identified mitigation measures. \nPest management \nPest management is another area where industry has made continual progress, with pesticide use significantly \nreduced due to the introduction of Bt cotton and implementation of IPM strategies. There has also been a \ndecrease in overall Environmental Toxic Load (ETL), representing a more targeted approach to herbicide use in \nefforts to reduce the environmental impact. GHD observed that farmers are working closely with their agronomists \nto look for innovative ways to manage pests, weeds and disease throughout the season with many farmers \nretaining native and remnant vegetation as habitat for beneficials, noting the benefit to their production. Biosecurity \nis a concern for growers, with over 50% of farms having a farm biosecurity plan, however there is room for \nimprovement in this (biosecurity) area. \nStakeholders contributing to this Assessment indicated generally positive views in relation to the industry’s IPM \nstrategies, including the use of genetically modified varieties, and biosecurity practices. Survey results did however \nindicate that a degree of poor perceptions continue around the industry’s overall chemical use and practices to \nmanage spray drift. \nBased on our overall findings, GHD has made the following recommendations for improvement in this area: \n8. Use regionally targeted approaches to increase the level of biosecurity planning to ensure sound biosecurity \npractices are in place on-farm. There is room for improvement in this area to ensure that growers are \nprepared and have strategies already in place for any future outbreaks or incursions of new pests, weeds or \ndiseases. \n9. Continue to work with the broader agricultural commu nity to increase the understanding and awareness of off-\ntarget spraying to minimise the potential for environmental impacts. \nAgrichemical and petrochemical storage, handling and waste \nGHD found that storage and handling of agrichemicals (such as fertiliser, pesticide, herbicide etc.) and \npetrochemicals, and waste management is an area where improvement is required across the industry. Cost was \nfound to be the biggest barrier to growers improving their storage, handling and waste management, particularly \nas these activities do not directly correlate with productivity or profitability. Additionally, the cost prohibitive nature \nof upgrading storage, handling and waste infrastructure on farm was found to be inhibiting myBMP uptake for \nmany growers who would otherwise be likely to achieve myBMP certification.  \nPractice in this area was found to be poorer in regions where supporting waste infrastructure, such as \ndrumMUSTER, is unavailable or not accessible or convenient. As these practices are typically not isolated to \ncotton production, there is a role for other agricultural industries and community service providers, to work with the \nindustry to increase focus in this area and aid the necessary on-farm improvements. \nDespite GHD’s on-farm observations, this was not identified as an area of particular concern in stakeholder \nconsultation and is not currently reported on in the industry’s sustainability framework. With the transition to a \ncircular economy becoming an increasing area of focus for governments, stakeholder perceptions around waste \nmanagement in particular may become more important in the future. \nGHD has made the following recommendations for improvement: \n10. Engage partner industries and service providers to aid improvement in on-farm storage, handling and waste \npractices.  \n11. Undertake regionally targeted education and awaren ess campaigns to improve storage, handling and waste \npractices on farm. This should be supported by the industry’s broader extension and myBMP programs. \n12. The SWG should undertake a materiality assessment  of waste management to consider if targets and \nindicators, or other explicit reporting of industry performance in this area is required. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry vi\n \nNatural Resource Management \nGHD considered practices relating to both soils and biodiversity in its assessment. It is noted that the industry has \nestablished goals for improvement for both of these topics in its sustainability framework, however challenges \naround defining and measuring improvement has meant that clear indicators and targets are not yet established. \nGHD observed that the industry is undertaking a number of projects regarding soil health and biodiversity, \nalongside broader agricultural industry initiatives. \nGHD found that there is a strong understanding of the importance of soil health and its overall benefits to \nproductivity amongst cotton growers, and to a lesser extent the benefits of remnant vegetation and riparian areas. \nOften where vegetation is retained, this is on the least productive land and faces additional pressures including \ngrazing, exotic weed invasion, feral pests, changes to fire regimes, dryland salinity, and soil erosion.  \nIt is important to note that broader stakeholder interest in biodiversity has increased since the Third Environmental \nAssessment and this is expected to continue with the introduction of a new Global Biodiversity Framework. \nParticular attention should be given to stakeholder concerns around biodiversity and native vegetation \nmanagement as the industry continues its expansion in Northern Australia. \nGHD makes the following recommendations in relation to the industry’s ongoing work in this area: \n13. Continue cross sector work to establish indicators and targets for biodiversity and soil, including continuing \nindustry specific investigations on nitrogen use and links to emissions. \n14. Increase extension efforts to assist grower unders tanding and awareness of how they can increase their \nnatural capital on farm. \nEnergy, emissions and climate \nIssues around energy use, emissions and adapting to climate change have received considerable global attention \nand subsequent shifts in stakeholder perceptions in the period since the Third Environmental Assessment. GHD \nobserved that grower sentiment has also changed with an increasing focus on carbon and emissions, even if \ngrowers are not yet in a place to implement on-farm changes.  \nThe industry has set itself a goal through the sustainability framework to contribute to the Paris Agreement’s aim of \na climate neutral world. This essentially means reducing the emissions released in cotton production while \nsustaining carbon in the soil and vegetation on cotton farms. Similar to soils and biodiversity, however, a GHG \nemissions target has not yet been developed by the SWG. \nGHD found that growers were especially interested in the prospects of carbon sequestration to offset emissions \nand opportunities for carbon farming. The general consensus around this at present amongst growers was that the \ncarbon farming system is still in its infancy and is hard to navigate. The agriculture sector as a whole is becoming \nincreasingly aware of the role they can play in emissions reductions and offsets, and communications resources \nare becoming available to assist farmers in making choices for their own production systems such as the \nAgriFutures Australia publication ‘A farmers handbook to on-farm carbon management’ (Carbon Count 2022).  \nGrowers participating in on-farm assessments and stakeholder consultation indicated that this is an area where \nthey require more information to ensure they can make informed decisions. Resources and decision-making tools \nwill help aid on-farm knowledge for growers to confidently implement changes to their practice. \nGHD makes the following recommendations in relation to the industry’s ongoing work in this area: \n15. Continue cross sector work to establish indicators and targets for GHG emissions and carbon storage, and \nensure alignment with government policies and programs on the establishment of agreed methodologies.  \n16. There is a need for increased extension to growers in  the area of energy, emissions and climate change. Due \nto the complex nature of climate change, carbon and GHG reporting, there is a role for industry is to provide \nhigh-level information and share case studies and learnings amongst industry participants, with specialist, \nlikely private sector, services required to offer growers more specific information to support on-farm decision \nmaking in respect to investment and/or market participation in this area. \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry vii\n \nContents \n \n1.

Introduction \nIn 1991, cotton became the first Australian agricultural industry to conduct a full external examination of its \nenvironmental performance. This marked the first industry-wide commitment to improved sustainability of cotton \nproduction in Australia.  \nEach decade since, the industry has re-committed to reviewing its environmental performance by commissioning \nan independent assessment. Environmental assessments in 2003 and 2012 have recognised the cotton industry’s \nachievements and driven further improvements. In response to the 2012 assessment, the industry made a public \ncommitment to continue to undertake environmental assessments every decade. At the same time, the industry \ncommitted to five yearly progress reporting against agreed sustainability indicators and targets, which are aligned \nwith the globally recognised United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \nGHD Pty Ltd (GHD) was engaged by the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) to complete the \nFourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton Industry.  \nThe recommendations from the assessment will be used to inform decisions for the industry to: \nx Target its investments to deliver improved environmental outcomes \nx Work with growers to continually improve environmental outcomes in cotton production \nx Demonstrate responsiveness to community and stakehol der expectations on the impact of the industry on \nthe environment. \nThe Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton Industry was undertaken between October 2021 \nand October 2022 and covers the period since the Third Environmental Assessment, being 2013-2022. The \ndelivery of the project was overseen by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) from CRDC and Cotton Australia, and \nthe industry’s Sustainability Working Group (SWG), which comprises membership from CRDC, Cotton Australia, \nCottonInfo, myBMP, the Australian Cotton Shippers Association and industry growers. \n1.1 The Australian Cotton Industry \nCotton is the most widely produced natural fibre in the world, and although Australia only produces around 3% of \nthe world’s cotton, it is the third to sixth largest exporter of cotton, depending on season (SWG 2014; Cotton \nAustralia 2022a). Between 2014-2019, Australia’s average annual gross value of cotton lint and seed production \nwas $1.8 Billion (SWG 2020). ABARES figures1 estimate that between 2012-2022 the average annual gross \nproduction of cotton lint was 749 kt and cotton seed was 1,018 kt (ABARES 2022). \nThe Australian cotton industry is made up of approximately 1,500 farms, 90% of which are family-owned and \noperated (Cotton Australia 2022a). Cotton farms are estimated to employ around 10,740 people per year with \nfurther industry employment provided by regional ginning facilities and a range of farm services, including crop \nconsultants, input suppliers, farming contractors, cotton classers and cotton merchants (SWG 2014, SWG 2020). \nCotton production in Australia is mostly focussed in the 400-800 mm summer rainfall zone, such that a proportion \nof the crop’s water needs are met by rain during the growing season (SWG 2014). In 2020-21, approximately 75% \nof the area of cotton grown in Australia was irrigated, with the rest rain fed (ABS 2022). It is important to note that \nirrigation allocation across Australia is in accordance with government regulations. The major cotton growing \nregions across Australia are shown in Figure 1.  \nExpansion of the industry’s footprint is one of the most significant changes to cotton production in Australia in the \nten years since the last environmental assessment. In particular, the proportion of the crop grown in southern \nNSW, including the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee and Murray, has increased from 14% of NSW cotton production in the \nfive years to 2014-15, to 28% of NSW cotton production in the five years to 2019-20 (NSW DPI 2021). This \nincrease in cotton production in southern NSW is largely attributable to improved technology, including cotton \nvarieties, which has meant a shift from rice production into cotton. Small areas of cotton have also been trialled as \nfar south as northern Victoria. \n \n1 ABARES data used to give an indication for the period from the previous environmental assessment to this current assessment. Figures are \nestimates and therefore slightly lower than the industry figures (which do not cover the whole period) \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 2\n \nAnother major expansion has begun in the Northern Territory (NT), in line with the NT Government’s plan to create \nnew regional and remote jobs and build the economy (Cotton Australia 2022a). This will include a new cotton gin \nnear Katherine (Rowley 2022). Due to significant improvements in the water efficiency of cotton crops and the \nlarge amount of wet season rainfall, it is estimated that 80% of cotton in the NT will be rain fed (not irrigated). In \n2020/21, twelve farmers in the NT had planted 8,000 ha of cotton, only 2% requiring irrigation (Cotton Australia \n2022a; Rowley 2022). Cotton expansion in northern Australia has also included production in Kununurra in \nWestern Australia and on the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland.  \n \nFigure 1 Major Australian cotton growing areas.

The program connects growers, consultants and \nagronomists with the latest research, technologies and innovations, supporting \nthe industry to achieve best practice.\nmyBMP is the Australian cotton industry’s voluntary certification standard, \ndemonstrating cotton growers’ achievement of best management practice at \nthe farm level and allowing them to access certain markets\n1.3 Structure of the report\nThis report presents the findings of the Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian cotton industry. \nSection 2 outlines the approach to completing this Environmental Assessment and includes reference to the \nAssessment Framework contained in Appendix B. It describes the process for selecting stakeholders and growers \nto engage with, and the procedure used for on-site farm visits. Section 3 provides a summary of the outcomes of \nthe three previous environmental audits and assessments of the industry. Current and emerging environmental \nissues and their implications for industry and on-farm management are discussed in Section 4, with the findings \nfrom the assessment of whether industry action and on-farm practices align with the identified trends and \nexpectations presented in Section 5. The summary of recommendations from the assessment are provided in \nSection 6. Supporting information is found in the Appendices.  \n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 4\n \n1.4 Scope and limitations \nThis report: has been prepared by GHD for Cotton Research & Development Corporation and may only be used and relied on \nby Cotton Research & Development Corporation for the purpose agreed between GHD and Cotton Research & Development \nCorporation as set out in sections 1 and 2.1 of this report. \nGHD otherwise disclaims responsibility to any person other than Cotton Research & Development Corporation arising in \nconnection with this report.

Methodology \n2.1 Terms of Reference \nThe Terms of Reference for the Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton Industry were to: \n1. Assess the cotton industry’s response to th e recommendations made in the Third Environmental \nAssessment (see Section 3.3.1) \n2. Identify current and emerging industry environmental  issues and their implications for the industry and on-\nfarm management. Policy developments, recognised global sustainability goals or initiatives, and industry \nand non-industry stakeholder perceptions and expectations should be considered (see Section 4) \n3. Assess current industry action on environmental is sues in light of the Third Environmental Assessment \nand identified environmental issues (see Section 5). This includes, but is not limited to: \na. Impact: if the industry’s on-farm environmental practices and outcomes are in line with current and \nfuture expectations and trends  \nb. Responsiveness: how well industry bodies, t he myBMP Program, CottonInfo and sustainability \nprograms are aligned; how well is industry able to identify and respond appropriately to \nenvironmental issues \nc. Consideration of stakeholder concerns and perceptions of industry action to address \nenvironmental issues. Different perspectives should be considered e.g. cotton industry (gins, \nshipping), state government, federal government, community and non-government organisations \n4. Recommend priorities for action based on the findings from 1, 2 and 3 above (see Section 6). \nThe scope of the Fourth Environmental Assessment included investigations of the environmental impacts of cotton \nproduction on-farm, including myBMP and non-myBMP farms, and excluded cotton gins, seed companies and \nother input suppliers. It is further noted that on-site farm visits were limited to the major growing areas of NSW and \nQueensland due to logistical challenges arising from COVID-19 and other factors restricting the ability to visit \nfarms in northern Australia during the period of the assessment. \n2.2 Approach \nThe environmental assessment was guided by an Assessment Framework (Appendix B), which was developed by \nGHD with input from the Project Steering Committee. The Assessment Framework outlines the assessment \napproach and evidence sought to address the Terms of Reference. There were five key elements to the approach, \nas further outlined in the sections below. \nIt is noted that similar to previous environmental assessments, GHD did not attempt to obtain a representative \nsample of stakeholders in consultation activities, rather the intent was to hear from a diverse range of industry \nstakeholders, as well as those members of the community who wished to participate and share their perspectives. \n2.2.1 Desktop review \nGHD undertook a desktop review of a range of information and data sources to inform the assessment. This \nincluded international and national literature to inform the understanding of current and emerging environmental \nissues, as well as a comprehensive review of publications, grower and stakeholder surveys, previous \nenvironmental assessments, sustainability reports, myBMP standards, organisational strategic plans, and media \nand communication products specific to the Australian cotton industry. \nThe reference list for this report is provided in Appendix A. \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 6\n \n2.2.2 Online stakeholder questionnaire \nAn online questionnaire was developed to gather insights and perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders to \ninform the assessment. The survey was open for a period of approximately 4 months, from February to June 2022.  \nGHD emailed the survey link to approximately 270 individuals or organisations inviting them to participate and/or \ndistribute the survey to others in their networks. This list included the following key stakeholder groups: \nx Agricultural and environmental peak groups and representative bodies \nx State and federal government environmental and agri cultural agencies, including Rural Research and \nDevelopment Corporations \nx Local government organisations across the growing regions in the various states \nx Natural resource management regional bodies \nx Community groups and other non-government organisations (NGOs). \nThe online questionnaire was also widely distributed by CRDC and Cotton Australia through their own networks \nand newsletter distribution lists. This included the SWG and ACSRG. It is important to note that the online \nquestionnaire was not intended to achieve a representative sample but rather to gain insights to the various \nstakeholder perceptions that exist around the Australian cotton industry’s environmental management and \nperformance, as well as to inform the identification of current and emerging issues. \nA total of 53 responses were received, including members of the cotton industry and its supply chain, other \nagricultural producers or organisation representatives, government agencies, NGOs, education and research \ninstitutions, community groups and private citizens. While respondents indicated they were located across all \nstates and territories (excluding Victoria and the ACT), the majority of responses came from participants in the NT \n(36%) and NSW (35%). \nThe online stakeholder survey questionnaire and a summary of responses is provided in Appendix C. \n2.2.3 On-site farm visits \nA key component of the Fourth Environmental Assessment was to undertake on-site farm visits in a number of the \nmajor growing regions, with the aim to assess both myBMP and non-myBMP farms and incorporating a range of \ndifferent farm characteristics, e.g. corporate vs. family farm, dryland vs. irrigated production, etc. \nIt is noted that while the environmental assessment considered the whole of the Australian industry, site visits \nwere focused on the major growing regions of Queensland and NSW. Northern Australia was excluded as a result \nof COVID-19 travel restrictions in place at the time, while the relatively small area under production in Victoria \nmeant that it was not practical to include visits to this area. Growers from these areas were invited to participate in \nthe online grower questionnaire.  \nA total of 25 farm visits were undertaken in four separate regional trips to Northern NSW / Southern QLD (5), \nSouthern NSW (8), Central NSW (5), and Central QLD (7). It is noted that there were some disruptions to farm visit \nprogram due to both COVID-19 implications and ongoing wet weather conditions. Of the 25 farms visited, 9 (36%) \nwere myBMP certified, 8 (32%) registered with the myBMP program, and 8 (32%) were not participating in the \nmyBMP program. Three (12%) of the farms visited were managed by corporate entities, with the remaining 22 \n(88%) family farms. \nFarm assessments were undertaken by experienced and certified Exemplar Global Environmental Management \nSystems Auditors. It is important to note that while the relevant audit standards were referenced in developing \nassessment criteria, the visits were not audits in themselves. Farmers remain anonymous and were not issued \nwith ‘non-conformances’ or ‘corrective actions’ as is standard auditing practice.  \nFarms were assigned with a grading of ‘excellent’, ‘very good’, ‘good’ or ‘poor’ for each assessment criteria based \non a combination of both grower responses in interviews and by site observations. \nA summary of the assessment criteria and gradings used for the on-site farm visits is provided in Appendix E. \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 7\n \n2.2.4 Online grower survey \nAn online grower survey questionnaire was utilised to gather grower specific insights on current and emerging \nissues as well as perceptions in relation to industry practice and performance. Further, the online grower \nquestionnaire was intended to provide the opportunity for growers across Australia’s cotton growing areas to \nparticipate in and contribute to the assessment. \nThe online grower survey was open for approximately two months across August and September 2022 and widely \npromoted by CRDC and Cotton Australia, including through their regional staff as well as at the 2022 Australian \nCotton Conference. A total of 16 grower responses were received, 9 of which were from growers in the Macquarie \nValley. It is likely that the number of responses received reflected a degree of survey fatigue amongst cotton \ngrowers given the annual CRDC grower survey, which received over 200 responses, was completed only a month \nprior. Despite the relatively low level of responses received, the grower responses provided a useful comparison of \nperceptions of current environmental issues, and industry performance against those provided by other \nstakeholder groups. For the purposes of the assessment, additional information relating to on-farm practice was \ncompared against information contained in the CRDC’s annual cotton grower surveys and the on-farm \nobservations undertaken as part of this assessment. \nThe online grower survey questionnaire and a summary of responses is provided in Appendix D. \n2.2.5 Targeted stakeholder consultation \nFinally, targeted consultation activities were undertaken to inform the assessment. Targeted consultation was \nundertaken to gain more detailed insights from stakeholders with a reasonable knowledge and/or exposure to the \nindustry, as well as input from relevant subject matter experts. Over 50 individuals participated in the various \nconsultation activities undertaken during the course of the assessment, which included: \nx Input from the CRDC/Cotton Aust ralia Project Steering Committee \nx Consultation with and observations of quarterly Sustainable Working Group meetings (October 2021, \nMarch, June and October 2022) \nx Consultation with and observations of the Aust ralian Cotton Sustainability Reference Group (November \n2021 and November 2022) \nx Key informant consultations to gather stakeholder in sights and perceptions, clarify industry information \nand/or obtain expert advice. These consultations typically followed a semi-structured interview approach \nusing questions similar to that contained in the online stakeholder survey. \nTargeted stakeholder consultation activities were at the discretion of the Assessment Team and included \nanonymous input from growers and industry organisations, supply chain participants, other agricultural, \ngovernment, NGO, education/research, and community representatives. \n  \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 8\n \n3. Industry response to previous \nenvironmental assessments \n3.1 First environmental audit \nThe first environmental audit of the Cotton industry was completed in 1991. The scope was to investigate the \nenvironmental impacts of cotton production, from the establishment of new cotton farms to the production of \nginned, raw cotton (Arbour International and Gibb Environmental Sciences 1991).  \nThis audit included a detailed literature review, synthesising the vast amount of information on various aspects \nassociated with the industry, an environmental questionnaire sent to key stakeholders (including growers), \ntargeted interviews (71) and site visits (20). There were 31 recommendations concerning pesticide use, 7 \nconcerning land use, 11 concerning water use, and 20 concerning cotton processing. \n3.2 Second environmental audit \nGHD completed the second environmental audit of the Cotton Industry in 2003. The aims of the second audit were \nto assess the industry’s response to the first audit’s recommendations, identify current environmental issues faced \nby the industry and recommend strategies and priorities to further improve the cotton industry’s environmental \nmanagement practices (GHD 2003). It was found that all 44 applicable recommendations from the first \nenvironmental audit had been implemented with high or partial compliance, only 5% rated as low compliance. The \nindustry was (at that time) facing increased scrutiny due to fish kills from pesticides, pesticide impacts on the cattle \nindustries (endosulfan), and perceived high water use.  \nThe audit methodology included a review of documentation, surveys and interviews of relevant stakeholders \n(government, community and environment groups, industry) (including two workshops), and site inspections \n(farms, cotton gins and seed processing facilities). GHD reported standout industry improvements from the \nprevious audit, which included: \nx Formulation and implementation of Best Management Practices (BMP) approach to cotton farming and \nenvironmental management \nx Improved pest management, including less reliance on pesticides and Integrated Pest Management \nstrategies including use of genetically modified cotton \nx Conducting strong research, extension and development program (leading to improved management \npractices in relation to pesticide use, pest management, water use (and efficiency), vegetation and land \nmanagement, waste recycling and disposal, wildlife management and biodiversity). \nThe Audit made 48 recommendations (broken into 126 sub-recommendations) across various areas (mostly \naligned with BMP modules) for both farms and processors. The audit concluded that despite vast improvements \nfrom the 1991 audit, there were still improvements to be made by industry specifically in the areas of water \nmanagement, pest management and pesticide use, and waste management.  \n3.3 Third environmental assessment \nThe third environmental assessment was completed in 2012 by Inovact Consulting. A terminology change from \n‘Environmental Audit’ to ‘Environmental Assessment’ was enacted to reflect the auditing capabilities of the myBMP \nprogram (update of BMP program to online myBMP in 2010) and alignment with State and Commonwealth \ngovernment understanding of strategic environmental assessments.  \nThe approach included a computer aided telephone interviewing survey of 150 growers, visits to 10 farms, online \nstakeholder survey, telephone discussions with organisations in the industry’s value-chain, and a small market \nresearch study of community perceptions. The assessment found ‘High’ adoption rates of 26 of the \nrecommendations from the second audit report; 4 were rated as ‘Low’ adoption, 8 were ‘Medium’, and numerous \nhad compliance by myBMP participants but unknown compliance by others; with the BMP/myBMP program shown \nto have driven cultural change and improvement across the industry. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 9\n \nThe report summarised the major achievements of the industry in improving its environmental performance since \nthe 2003 Environmental Audit as: \nx Effective and responsible management of the industr y’s use of genetically modified cotton varieties \nx The substantial reduction in the use of chemicals pa rticularly insecticides and residual herbicides for \ncotton growing and the disappearance of serious off-farm impacts in rivers and wetlands \nx Major gains in water use efficiency  in cotton growing calculated at three to four per cent per year and \neffective management and stewardship of water resources on-farm \nx Major advances in grower attitudes and action co ncerning natural resource management on farm and \nactive engagement in landscape and catchment wide natural resource management, particularly \nmanagement of deep drainage, riparian management, groundwater conservation and delivery of \necosystem services \nx Significant uptake of integrated pest management (I PM) and the link being established between IPM and \nbiodiversity conservation in terms of ecosystem services on-farm and at a landscape scale \nx Development of an integrated research, development and extension system that delivers priority research \nand development and extends this to growers through an online best management practices program \n(myBMP) and the extension activities of the industry’s key organisations such as Cotton Australia and the \ncommercial sector. \nThe recommendations from the Third Environmental Assessment (Inovact Consulting 2012) and GHD’s \nassessment of the industry’s response (ToR 1) are outlined below. \n3.3.1 Assessment of industry respon se to recommendations from the \nThird Environmental Assessment \nInovact Consulting (2012) made six recommendations in its final report on the Third Environmental Assessment of \nthe Australian cotton industry as outlined in Table 1. The industry issued a formal response to the \nrecommendations of the Third Environmental Assessment via a joint statement from CRDC and Cotton Australia \nin February 2016. GHD has considered this response along with information reviewed as part of the Fourth \nEnvironmental Assessment on industry initiatives undertaken since the response was issued, and feedback \nobtained from consultation with industry stakeholders. GHD’s assessment of the industry’s response to the \nrecommendations is based on a subjective scoring system (ضضضachieved, ضضpartially achieved, some \nprogress made, X - not achieved) and is summarised in Table 1 below. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 10\n \nTable 1: Assessment of industry response to the Third Environmental Assessment recommendations \nNo. Recommendation Progress Comments \n1 That CRDC work with its grower base, Cotton \nAustralia, the industry’s value chain, cotton \nindustry service providers, the Australian \nGovernment and relevant state government \nagencies to develop a five-year RD&E strategy for \ncontinuous improvement in environmental \nmanagement and performance in cotton growing. \nضضضThe cotton industry has a number of strategic plans, as outlined in Appendix C, all of which have \nidentified environmental and sustainability areas of focus. The CRDC Strategic Plan, which guides \nthe industry’s RD&E investment is currently being developed for a new five-year period, i.e. \n2023-2028, and aims to more closely align with the SWG PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. goals.  \n \n \n2 That the industry undertakes a significant re-\nappraisal of myBMP and its role in the industry’s \nassurance to markets and other stakeholders of \nbest practice environmental stewardship by \ngrowers. \nضضIn its 2016 response to the recommendations, the Australian cotton industry reported that it had \nundertaken a reappraisal of myBMP and its role in both delivering on-farm environmental \nstewardship and helping to underpin access to market strategies. A key milestone was the \nrecognition of myBMP by the then Better Cotton Initiative, allowing myBMP certified growers \naccess to this market. The industry also noted that an upgrade was underway to improve the \nvalue, impact and accessibility of the myBMP program and its platform for the direct benefit of \ngrowers. \nIn the Fourth Environmental Assessment, GHD found that myBMP has continued to drive the \nstandards for best management practice across the industry. While the program is well \nrecognised and its resources extensively used, widespread myBMP accreditation has not yet \nbeen achieved. \nGHD concludes that while progress has been made since the Third Environmental Assessment, \nthe myBMP program will need to continue to evolve to provide a more effective and efficient \nenvironmental management and performance tool. The program has significant potential to \nachieve the complementary objectives of adding value to growers at the farm level, substantiating \nthe industry’s sustainability credentials, and ultimately, underpinning market assurance. \n3 That CRDC and Cotton Australia collaborate on \nestablishing accurate and up to date databases of \ncotton growers and key industry stakeholders to \nensure that the industry organisations effectively \nengage levy paying growers and influential \nstakeholders on industry plans and performance \nreporting regarding environmental management \nand practices. \nضضCRDC and Cotton Australia have outlined that they are committed to, and are working together to \nachieve, collaboration on accurate and up to date databases of cotton growers and key industry \nstakeholders to ensure greater communication and engagement with industry. Through our \nconsultation with CRDC, Cotton Australia and the SWG, it is clear that an extensive distribution \nlist is maintained of growers and other stakeholders with an interest in the industry’s sustainability \nwork.  \nDuring the course of this Assessment, however, GHD found a number of discrepancies in the \ngrower list, particularly in relation to myBMP status (note that this related to myBMP registration \nrather than myBMP certification). The Assessment Team also experienced difficulties in engaging \ngrowers to participate in the Assessment. While it is clear that efforts are being made to ensure \ncurrency of databases, and we acknowledge that there are challenges in sharing contact \ninformation across the different industry organisations due to privacy considerations, GHD \nconsiders that this is an area that will require ongoing work. \n4 That the industry continue to commission \nindependent environmental assessments of cotton \ngrowing in five-yearly time periods to establish \nlonger term trends in its environmental \nضضضFollowing the Third Environmental Assessment, the industry reaffirmed its commitment to \ncommissioning independent environmental assessments every ten years. In addition to this \ncommitment, the industry has commenced comprehensive sustainability reporting, incorporating \nenvironmental indicators, on a five-yearly basis with annual progress updates. The industry’s \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 11\n \nNo. Recommendation Progress Comments \nperformance and data sets that provide evidence \nbased assessments over long periods of time. It is \nalso recommended that a practical monitoring, \nevaluation and reporting framework be established \nthat will support evidence based annual reporting \non the outcomes of environmental management in \ncotton growing. \nSWG oversees the implementation of its sustainability framework and undertakes quarterly \nmateriality scans to ensure its ongoing currency and relevance. \nGHD considered whether the sustainability framework that has been developed since the Third \nEnvironmental Assessment negated the need for the ten yearly environmental assessments, \ngiven it includes material measures of environment performance. It was concluded that \nenvironmental assessments, with a particular focus on independent on-farm assessments of both \nmyBMP and non-myBMP growers across the various growing regions, are still warranted. The \nindustry might re-consider the ongoing need for independent environmental assessment when \nand if the certification of farms through the myBMP program is taken up more broadly.  \n5 That the cotton industry value chain, including the \ngrower sector, actively engage with market based \ninitiatives such as the Better Cotton Initiative to \nmonitor international consumer preferences and \nretailer strategies and actions so that this \nintelligence can be incorporated into industry \nstrategies and actions for improvements in \nenvironmental practices that are market driven. \nضضضSince the previous assessment, the industry has actively engaged in market-based initiatives in \nresponse to this recommendation through the Cotton to Market strategy, which was established in \n2013, driven by Cotton Australia, and underpinned by research from CRDC. Key achievements \nduring this time have included the establishment of the cottonLEADS partnership, the \nbenchmarking of myBMP with the Better Cotton Initiative (now Better Cotton) and establishing \nrelationships with 30 active brand partners. \nGHD notes that as the Cotton to Market strategy is now at the ten-year mark, the industry is \nappropriately reviewing and redeveloping its strategy to ensure alignment between industry and \ncustomer needs. The new Strategic Roadmap will consider how increasing demands for \ntransparency and traceability can be met through the industry’s sustainability framework, myBMP \nprogram, and other industry data.  \n6 That the industry continue its market research on \nconsumer, community and stakeholder perceptions \nof the environmental performance and practices of \ncotton growing that updates and extends the \nprevious studies to take account of how individuals \nand organisations now access information through \ncontemporary media which has changed \nconsiderably since these studies. \nضضضGHD observed that the industry undertakes a range of market research activities in relation to \nconsumer, community, and stakeholder perceptions. Examples include research projects \nundertaken through the Cotton to Market program, partnership in the Community Trust in Rural \nIndustries Program, and establishment of the Australian Cotton Sustainability Reference Group \n(ACSRG).  \nAn ongoing challenge remains as to how the industry is best able to use this information to \nundertake the range of necessary communication, education and marketing activities that are \nrequired to target its wide range of stakeholders. The recently announced Strategic Roadmap will \nprovide a further opportunity for the industry to engage with its stakeholders with the aim of \nensuring alignment between the industry’s needs and that of its customers.  \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 12\n4. Current and emerging issues \nThe Third Environmental Assessment of the Australian cotton industry (Inovact Consulting 2012) was undertaken \nat a time of considerable national interest in the industry’s water use and environmental stewardship, particularly in \nthe context of the industry’s location in the riverine areas of the Murray-Darling and Fitzroy Basins. In developing \nits priority areas for future industry action, Inovact Consulting noted that there had been a significant change in the \ncontext in which the industry faced its environmental management. It highlighted the following emerging drivers for \nimproved environmental performance:\nx The operating environment for the industry is much more complex and demanding in terms of improving \nbusiness productivity and profitability\nx Global competitiveness and market expectations of environmental stewardship\nx The policies, programs and regulatory requirement of governments relating to the environment\nx The long-term pressures on Murray-Darling Basin water resources and the prospective introduction of a \nMurray-Darling Basin Plan\nx Public expectations for good environmental and social stewardship.\nIn line with Terms of Reference for the Fourth Environmental Assessment (ToR 2), GHD has reviewed a range of \ninformation sources and undertaken consultation with industry stakeholders to consider the current and emerging \nenvironmental issues relevant to the industry and its on-farm management. It found that the emerging drivers \nidentified in the Third Environmental Assessment have continued to gather pace, with increasing public interest in \nenvironmental issues triggering a new swathe of international agreements and commitments, market responses, \nand domestic policies and programs relevant to the industry’s operating environment. A summary of the key \ndrivers and trends, and the implications for the Australian cotton industry are summarised in the following sections.\n4.1 International trends and drivers\nA major global policy development since the Third Environmental Assessment has been the United Nations (UN) \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all \nUnited Nations (UN) member states in 2015, along with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN n.d.). \nThe SDGs aim to involve all countries in taking simultaneous action to move towards ending poverty, improving \nhealth and educations, reducing inequality, spurring economic growth, whilst tackling climate change and working \nto preserve our oceans and forests (UN, n.d.). The Australian cotton industry has recognised the importance of the \nUN SDGs and the role they can play in contributing to achieving the SDGs, aligning their own sustainability \nframework with the relevant SDGs, as outlined in Table 2 (Cotton Australia and CRDC 2020). \nTable 2: Australian cotton industry’s alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals\nSDG Description Australian Cotton’s contribution\nEnsure availability and \nsustainable management \nof water for all.\nWATER: Research has shown a long-term trend of a reduction in the \nvolume of water needed to grow a bale of Australian cotton every five \nyears. This trend is the result of sustained research and practice change. \nMaintaining this trend will become increasingly difficult over time and will \nrequire increasingly more effort.\nThere is alignment with CRDC’s ‘less drops per crop’ sustainability \ninitiative.\nTake urgent action to \ncombat climate change \nand its impacts.\nCARBON: The industry is working to reduce emissions, increase the \namount of carbon stored on farms, and accurately measure their net \ncarbon footprint. For many years the industry has invested in research and \nadoption to strengthen grower resilience.\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 13\nSDG Description Australian Cotton’s contribution\nProtect, restore and \npromote sustainable use \nof terrestrial ecosystems, \nhalt and reverse land \ndegradation and halt \nbiodiversity loss.\nBIODIVERSITY: The industry is working toward more accurate \nmeasurements of native vegetation and to increase the area of cotton \nfarmland managed for conservation. Biodiversity on cotton farms can \nprovide natural pest control and pollination, control erosion, store carbon \nand enhance water retention.\nEnsure sustainable \nconsumption and \nproduction patterns\nPESTICIDES: The industry is working to reduce the volume of pesticides, \n& to reduce their toxicity to human health and the environment. Central to \nthis is Integrated Pest Management, a strategy to manage pests with a \nrange of practices including crop rotations, weed control, and native \nvegetation and refuge crops to house ‘beneficial’ insects and birds.\nPromote sustainable \nagriculture.\nEFFICIENCY: The industry invests heavily in research to increase yields, \nand innovative cotton growers spend time and money adopting this \nresearch and new technologies.\nPromote sustained, \ninclusive and sustainable \neconomic growth, full \nand productive \nemployment and decent \nwork for all.\nPROFITABILITY: Profitability is a fundamental sustainability indicator for \ngrowers. Profitable cotton growers can re-invest in their own business, and \ncontribute to local communities, economies and the environment.\nSAFETY: Agriculture contributes disproportionately to workplace health \nand safety incidents across Australia. The industry acknowledges that \nmore needs to be done to reduce the number of deaths and serious \ninjuries on cotton farms.\nAchieve gender equality \nand empower all women \nand girls.\nReduce inequality\nDIVERSITY: The industry has programs to support a diversity of age, \ngender, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the cotton \nindustry. The industry also monitors the cultural diversity of our workforce.\nEnsure inclusive and \nequitable quality \neducation and promote \nlifelong learning \nopportunities for all\nTRAINING: Building the adaptive capacity of the Australian cotton industry \nis essential to maximise opportunities and minimise disruptions caused by \ntechnological transformation and environmental changes. The industry is \ninvesting in science and innovation capability, new knowledge and futures \nthinking to build this capacity.\nEnsure healthy lives and \npromote well-being for all \nat all ages.\nStrengthen the means of \nimplementation and \nrevitalize the global \npartnership for \nsustainable \ndevelopment.\nWELLBEING: The industry has just started to monitor the wellbeing of \ncotton growers and their communities. They are using this information to \nunderstand if and how they can do more to work with government, \ncommunities, other industries and individuals to improve the welling and \nsocial capital of their people and regional communities.\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 14\n \nAlso in 2015, another significant international development occurred with the Paris Agreement, which was entered \ninto force in November 2016 (AGDISER 2021). The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty aiming \nto limit temperature increase to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels (UN 2022). \nGlobal (averaged) air temperature has increased 1°C since 1850 and each decade since the 1980s has been \nwarmer than the last (CSIRO and BoM 2015). While the Paris Agreement is focused on reduction in emissions, \nadditional key aspects are climate change mitigation and adaptation, which will include managing water use to \nadapt to increasing temperature, extreme weather events and drought. Parties to the Agreement (of which \nAustralia is) are required to communicate their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) every five years (UN \n2022). These NDCs provide information on actions and progress towards the Paris Agreement goals. Additionally, \nall countries are required to annually report GHG emissions and progress towards their NDC. \nMore recently, the Secretariat of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) released the draft of the new \npost-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which is due to be further considered at the CBD’s next meeting of its \n196 Parties, COP-15, to be held in Montreal in December 2022 (CBD 2021). The Framework in its current form \nsets out targets and milestones to be achieved by 2030 on the path toward ‘living in harmony with nature’ by 2050. \nIt includes 21 targets, one of which is a global conservation target for land and sea areas of 30% by 2030 – a goal \nwhich the new Federal Environment Minister, the Hon Tanya Plibersek MP, announced support for when she \nreleased the 2021 State of the Environment report in July of this year. \nIncreasingly, there is now reference to becoming ‘nature positive’ following G7 leaders agreeing to halt and \nreverse biodiversity loss by 2030, announcing that that it is not just necessary to reach net zero by 2030, but also \nto become ‘nature positive’ (G7 2021). The G7 2030 Nature Compact, agreed at Cornwall in 2021, contains four \npillars: \nx Leading the transition to sustainabl e and legal use of natural resources \nx Investing in nature and driving a nature positive economy \nx Protecting, conserving and restoring nature, including through ambitious global targets \nx Prioritising accountability and implementation of commitments for nature. \nWith many of these international commitments being driven by European leaders, it is no surprise that European \ncountries are amongst the first implementing strict new legislations and market requirements focused on improved \nenvironmental stewardship and sustainability. In a presentation titled, ‘What’s lurking over the horizon?’ at the \n2022 Australian Cotton Conference, CRDC’s General Manager, R&D Investment, Allan Williams, pointed to the \nfollowing European Union (EU) initiatives as having particular relevance to the Australian cotton industry: \nx EU Green Deal – a set of policy initiatives agreed by the European Commission in 2020 with the \noverarching aim of making the EU climate neutral in 2050, to be supported by the investment of 1 trillion \nEuros in funding. The textile industry is explicitly called out in these policies, identified as having the 4\nth \nhighest environmental impact \nx EU Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) – th e European Commission adopted a new CEAP in March \n2020 as one of the main building blocks of the EU Green Deal. The plan aims to reduce pressure on \nnatural resources and to create sustainable growth and jobs \nx EU Textile Strategy – a strategy for sustainable and ci rcular textiles that aims to create a ‘greener’ and \nmore competitive textiles sector by looking at the entire lifecycle of textile products. The four-part 2030 \nvision for textiles includes that “fast fashion is out of fashion”.  \nIn another session on sustainability at the 2022 Australian Cotton Conference, Senior Commodity Analyst for \nRabobank Analyst, Cheryl Kalisch Gordon, addressed the question as to whether the current world economic \nturbulence would affect the international environment and sustainability agenda. She concluded that while the \ncurrent global turmoil does challenge political and consumer resolve for sustainability, it is not expected change \nthe direction of the trend. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 15\n \n4.2 Global market responses \n4.2.1 Market transparency and reporting \nGlobally, markets and their participants are adjusting to comply with a changing regulatory environment as well as \nrespond to consumer expectations around sustainability and environmental stewardship. There are now an \nincreasing number of frameworks, standards and reporting mechanisms aimed at allowing entities to increase the \nlevel of transparency relating to their environmental credentials and sustainability more broadly. These include: \nx ESG is the terminology used to describe how enti ties are incorporating Environment, Social and \nGovernance (ESG) priorities into their strategy, operations and reporting. The Australian Farm Institute \n(AFI) has been doing considerable work in this area and recently hosted its Annual Roundtable event on \nthe topic, to provide a forum to discuss the capability and capacity of Australian agriculture in ESG \nx The Global Reporting Initiative provides a set of standards and tools for increasing transparency through \nsustainability reporting \nx The Science Based Targets initiative  (SBTi) is a partnership between not-for-profit charity CDP (previously \nCarbon Disclosure Project), the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund \nfor Nature (WWF) established to support the private sector and provide guidance to setting science-based \nemissions reduction targets. Rabobank (2022) reports that globally, the number of food and agribusiness \norganisations registering with SBTi more than doubled in 2021 \nx The Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), currently in draft form, intends to provide \na methodology for entities, to quantify and report their impact on nature. The Taskforce comprises 34 \nindividual Taskforce Members representing global financial institutions, corporates and market service \nproviders representing a total US$19.4 trillion in assets with a footprint in over 180 countries (TNFD n.d.) \nEfforts by industries and individual entities to promote their environmental and sustainability credentials has also \ngiven rise to the term “greenwashing”, which is essentially the misrepresentation of credentials to gain a market \nadvantage. This in turn has given rise to a new raft of international laws to counter this practice and ensure \nconfidence in markets. The Australian Consumer & Competition Commission (ACCC) is one such regulator \nincreasing their focus in this area. Markets are also responding to this threat through an increased focus on \nproduct traceability. \n4.2.2 Sustainable brands \nThrough its Cotton to Market program, which began in 2013, Cotton Australia has actively sought to increase the \nglobal demand for Australian cotton by communicating and marketing it as a high quality, sustainable natural fibre. \nKey initiatives have included: \nx Cotton LEADS: established in 2013 as a partnership between Cotton Australia and the US cotton industry \n(The Cotton Foundation), Cotton LEADS promotes the use of responsibly sourced cotton and providing \nevidence of best practice cotton production and traceability (SWG 2014). Cotton LEADS has over 200 \nglobal partners \nx Better Cotton: in 2014 Cotton Australia joined the gl obal program Better Cotton (formerly known as Better \nCotton Initiative (BCI)). Better Cotton is focused on improving the sustainability of cotton farming globally \nand bringing together farmers, ginners, manufacturers, retailers, brands, civil society and grassroots \norganisations in a unique global community committed to developing Better Cotton (BC) as a sustainable \nmainstream commodity. The BC Standard System includes Better Cotton Principles and Criteria, which lay \nout the global definition of Better Cotton through seven guiding principles. These include crop protection, \nwater management, soil health, biodiversity and decent work. The alignment of the myBMP program to BC \nallows Australian cotton growers to participate more effectively in the world market. In the 2021/22 Cotton \nAustralia Annual Report it is reported that those producing BC marketed cotton were achieving a $3-$7 per \nbale price premium as textile brands lean towards sustainably produced cotton \nx Textile Exchange: in 2016 myBMP became recognised as a Preferred Fibre by Textile Exchange (Textile \nExchange 2022). Textile Exchange is a global non-profit organisation that publishes an annual Preferred \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 16\nFibre and Materials Benchmark, which is a platform that enables brands and retailers to measure, manage \nand track their use of preferred fibres and materials (Textile Exchange 2022).  \nA review of Better Cotton’s Annual Reports for the past five years provides information on the global supply and \ndemand of Better Cotton. The 2021 Annual Report (Better Cotton 2022) stated that it had been a record year for \nBetter Cotton, with 260 Retailer and Brand Members collectively sourcing 2.5 million tonnes of Better cotton, \naccounting for 10% of global production. Importantly, this represented a 47% increase on 2020 sourcing volumes. \nFigure 2 shows the increase in the volume of Better Cotton grown throughout the world for the five year period \nfrom 2016/17 to 2020/21. It is also worth noting that the volume of Australian cotton produced as Better Cotton \nover the same period has remained relatively stable, representing around 3% of total Better Cotton produced. The \nvolume from major competitor Brazil, has more than doubled over the same period and made up 42% of Better \nCotton produced in 2020-21, with the second largest contributor being India, whose production of Better Cotton \nhas almost tripled over the same period and in 2020-21 made up close to 20% of Better Cotton production.\nFigure 2 Growth in world Better Cotton production and licenced farmers\nCotton Australia has worked to increase awareness amongst brands operating in Australia. In 2016, the increased \nawareness and changing societal/consumer preferences led to the partnership between a prominent Australian \nclothing supplier and Cotton Australia. The supplier desired to transition to a sustainable cotton and minimise \nimpacts on the environment and had customer research which perceived Australian Cotton as superior quality and \na way to support local jobs and industry (SWG 2020). The supplier looked favourably on Cotton Australia’s \nleadership in the sustainability space, the industry’s partnership with Better Cotton (global sustainable cotton \ninitiative) and the myBMP program as an example of global best practice in environmental management (SWG \n2020). \nCotton Australia has successfully partnered with leading fashion labels to market ethically and sustainably sourced \ncotton garments. Some of the current brand ambassadors include Kmart, Country Road, Sussan, Bonds, Rod and \nGunn and Elk the Label. Country Road is currently working with Landcare Australia on the Biodiversity Project to \nrestore farmlands and support local farmers and responsible farming practices. The project is funded via sales of \ntheir Verified Australia cotton heritage sweats and profiles two NSW based cotton farming families and their \ncommitment to sustainable farming (Country Road 2022).\n4.3 Domestic context\n4.3.1 Environmental policy and legislation\nIn the domestic setting, environmental management is heavily regulated as governments respond to both its \ninternational commitments and the Australian community’s expectations around environmental management and \nprotection. In its 2019 Sustainability Report, SWG reports that the Australian cotton industry is regulated by a strict \nlegislative framework which is applied at federal, state and local government levels affecting all aspects of cotton \nfarming operations, and in an environmental context includes:\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 17\n \nx Management of irrigation water from dams and underground supplies \nx Application of pesticides \nx Storage and handling of pesticides and petrochemicals on-farm \nx Licensing arrangements for access and use of transgenic traits \nx Management of trees and native vegetation. \nThe industry’s myBMP program is designed to assist growers manage and comply with their legal obligations. \nAround half of the 300 myBMP checklist items relate to industry best practice and provide evidence of legal \ncompliance (SWG 2020). \nThe Third Environmental Assessment (Inovact Consulting 2012) cited long-term pressures on Murray-Darling \nBasin water resources, flagging the introduction of a Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Ten years later, there are still key \nelements of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to be implemented, including water recovery in some of the industry’s \nkey growing areas. The Plan itself is also scheduled for review in 2026. Addressing the future challenges \nassociated with climate change, and improving the recognition of First Nation’s values and enhancing their \ninvolvement in water management are already flagged as key areas of focus (Houston 2022). \nIn the period since the previous assessment, the cotton industry has continued to suffer community backlash in \nrelation to water use. In 2017, a report by the ABC program Four Corners alleged that water purchased by the \nCommonwealth Government was being pumped by irrigators and stored for irrigation of crops, including cotton, \nand that there were instances where water meters used by irrigators had been tampered with. The report \nprompted a number of government responses, including a Royal Commission by the South Australian \nGovernment, and establishment of the National Resource Access Regulator by the NSW Government to ensure \ncompliance with NSW water laws, including use of water for irrigation. \nFloodplain harvesting, a process by which overland flows are harvested following rainfall, flooding or natural rising \nof water to the surface, is an important source of irrigation water in northern NSW and Queensland growing areas, \nbut has also been subject to considerable public scrutiny in recent years. Floodplain harvesting extraction is to be \nmanaged within the Sustainable Diversion Limits established in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, with both NSW and \nQLD have licensing processes in place to limit floodplain harvesting to levels taken in the year 2000.  \nThe NSW Floodplain Harvesting Policy has been in place since June 2021, and contains processes for \ndetermining floodplain harvesting entitlements, issuing of floodplain harvesting licences and monitoring and \nreporting of floodplain harvesting activities. Despite floodplain harvesting licences already being determined and \nissued for eligible water users in the NSW Border Rivers and Gwydir Valleys, regulatory amendments to support \nimplementation of the NSW Floodplain Harvesting Policy have been disallowed three times in the NSW \nParliament, resulting in a considerable degree of uncertainly for water users. \nQueensland had previously issued a moratorium on additional floodplain harvesting in 2000 to prevent growth in \nharvesting volumes. At the time of writing this assessment, Queensland is planning (through the Queensland Rural \nWater Management Program) to improve measurement and monitoring of floodplain harvesting and has \ncommitted to full measurement and licensing of the Border Rivers and Moonie Floodplains to be in place by 2022. \nIn coming to Government in May 2022, the Federal Labor Government has been particularly critical of the previous \ngovernment’s implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and environmental policy more broadly. On release \nof the 2021 State of the Environment Report, which showed decline in Australia’s natural environment, the Federal \nEnvironment Minister made a number of policy commitments, including promising a response to the Samuel \nReview of the EPBC Act and establishment of a Federal Environmental Protection Agency to enforce \nenvironmental law. \nThe Federal Water Minister also recently met with Australia’s state and territory Environment Ministers where they \nmade three “landmark commitments” to halt and reverse biodiversity loss across the nation: \nx To work collectively to achieve a national target to protect and conserve 30% of Australia’s landmass \nand 30% of Australia’s marine areas by 2030 \nx To note the Commonwealth’s intention to establish a national nature repair market and work together to \nmake nature positive investments easier, focusing on a consistent way to measure and track biodiversity \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 18\nx To work with the private sector to design out waste and pollution, keep materials in use, and foster \nmarkets to achieve a circular economy by 2030. \nThe increased focus by governments on ‘nature-based solutions’, including the establishment of carbon and \nbiosecurity markets, does provide some opportunity for Australian agricultural producers as the stewards of a large \namount of Australia’s land and water resources. In its 2030 Roadmap, the National Farmers Federation (NFF) has \nset a goal that the net benefit to farmers for the provision of ecosystem services is equal to 5% of farm revenue. \nNatural capital markets, however, have proven to be a complex and rapidly evolving area for growers to navigate. \nConsultation with stakeholders as part of this assessment and our observations through other work, suggests that \nwhile there is much interest from landholders around natural capital markets, there is also much confusion.\nAt the same time increasing restrictions have been placed on the use of natural resources in south-eastern \nAustralia, government policies and programs have sought to expand irrigated agricultural production across \nNorthern Australia. As noted in section 1.1, in recent years this has included the expansion of the Australian cotton \nindustry to Far North Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.\n4.4 Stakeholder perceptions of the Australian cotton \nindustry’s environmental performance\nAs outlined in section 2.2, GHD sought to obtain a broad range of stakeholder views on the industry’s \nenvironmental performance through a combination of online grower and stakeholder surveys, and targeted \nconsultations. There was a large change in demographic of the stakeholders participating in surveys and \ninterviews carried out from the Third to the Fourth Environmental Assessment, resulting in different survey \noutcomes. The Third Environmental Assessment contained relatively positive perceptions from the stakeholder \ngroup about the environmental performance of the industry, whereas the Fourth received more diverse responses, \npossible due to the greater diversity of respondents. It is noted that 19 of the 53 responses to the online \nstakeholder survey in the Fourth Environmental Assessment were from the Northern Territory, of which 9 rated the \noverall environmental performance of the industry as ‘very poor’. Growers were asked the same set of questions \nabout overall industry performance and were far more positive in the responses, with all 16 respondents providing \nratings of ‘very good’ or ‘good’. \nThe responses to the surveys and interviews provide some interesting insights to the varying perspectives across \nregions and stakeholder groups, as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 below.\nFigure 3 Stakeholder perceptions of the industry’s overall current environmental performance (online stakeholder survey \nresponses) \n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 19\nFigure 4 Stakeholder perceptions of the industry’s overall curren t environmental performance, excluding responses from the \nNT\nFigure 5 Grower perceptions of the industry’s overall current environmental performance (online grower survey responses)\nBoth growers and stakeholders were also asked to identify the top environmental issues they considered the \nindustry to be currently facing, as well those that the industry would need to take action on over the next 5-10 \nyears. The responses are shown in Figure 6.\nThe stakeholder survey identified perceptions that ongoing focus will be on water, biodiversity, chemical use and \nclimate change. Areas which are seen to be of an increasing focus over the next 5-10 years include resistance and \nclimate change related issues. In the 2012 Environmental Assessment, water was the primary environmental \nconcern, followed by emissions on-farm and soil health as emerging issues. Water remains the priority issue \namongst stakeholders in 2022, followed by chemical use and biodiversity. Biodiversity was previously ranked as \n8\nth most important, showing some shift in stakeholder perceptions of the importance of this issue. However, it is \nalso worth noting that biodiversity did not feature in grower responses, with no grower participants rating it in the \ntop three as either a current issue or an issue the industry needs to take action on in the next 5-10 years.\nThe issues of land clearing for cotton use and its related impacts on biodiversity, soil health and water use is a \ncurrent and potentially growing issue in the Northern Territory leading to increased public interest. The stakeholder \nsurvey, along with in person calls, identified that there may be a different scope of environmental issues currently \nfacing the Northern Territory compared to the more established cotton districts in Queensland and New South \nWales.\nIn the case of the responses to the same question in the grower suvey, while water also ranked as the highest \ncurrent and emerging issues, climate change was also considered important, as was issues around public \nperception, chemical and fertiliser use, and energy. This compares to grower responses in the Third \nEnvironmental Assessment where water use efficiency, pesticide/ herbicide use/ management, and managing \nsprays/spray drift ranked as the highest issues for growers, indicating that climate change related issues have \nincreased in importance for growers since the previous assessment.\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 20\nFigure 6 Stakeholder (left) and grower (right) perceptions of current and emerging environmental issues\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 21\n \n4.5 Implications for industry \nIn summary, our review of current and emerging environmental issues with the potential to impact the Australian \ncotton industry and on-farm management found that the emerging drivers identified in the Third Environmental \nAssessment have continued to gather pace. Public interest in environmental issues has continued to increase, \ntriggering a new swathe of international agreements and commitments, more stringent market requirements, and a \nrange of domestic policy and program responses relevant to the industry’s operating environment. \nThroughout the course of our assessment, GHD has observed that the industry has sound processes in place to \nidentify and respond to such issues, through the implementation of an industry-wide sustainability framework \nwhich is overseen by the SWG. In particular, materiality scans are undertaken quarterly to ensure current and \nemerging issues are identified and to identify their relevance to the industry’s sustainability agenda. Having \ncommenced sustainability reporting in 2014, the cotton industry is now contributing to work the Australian \nagricultural industry is undertaking more broadly, through the development of the Australian Agricultural \nSustainability Framework2. This framework seeks to communicate the sustainability status and goals of the \nAustralian agricultural industry overall to markets and the community. \nAs was found in previous assessments, the industry is backed by a strong RD&E model – stakeholders commonly \nuse the terms ‘progressive’, ‘innovative’ and ‘collaborative’ when referring to its track record. That being said, \nevidence of industry improvement over time and current observations of performance on-farm does not always \nalign with public perceptions. Water management and use remains a particularly contentious issue, and \ncompetition for increasingly scarce water resources, particularly in the context of climate change, will continue to \nlead to public scrutiny in this area and increased regulatory pressures. \nExpansion into new growing areas has the potential to increase the overall contribution of the Australian cotton \nindustry to the national economy but will create new RD&E needs, as well as challenges for the industry’s \ncommunication and engagement efforts. The industry has faced a number of challenges to its social licence to \noperate in the past (as outlined in previous assessments), and in this assessment stakeholders have flagged that \nas the industry’s footprint expands, some of these issues may be revisited by new communities. It was also raised \nthat the need to trial new approaches under different growing conditions, has the potential to increase the risk of \nenvironmental incident/s. \nAs well as the need to maintain social licence in the communities in which it operates, the industry will come under \nincreasing pressure to meet new market expectations globally, as well as keep up with international competitors in \nthis area. Not only are markets demanding increased transparency of the sustainability of industries and entities at \nthe international level, but there is also an expectation of greater ambition in target setting. While it is clear that \nAustralia’s efficient production of high-quality cotton fibre presents opportunity for the domestic industry, and the \nindustry has committed to goals and targets through its sustainability framework, market assurance through \nprograms like myBMP are likely to become a minimum requirement for some markets in the future. That is, \nsustainability credentials may not attract significant premiums but will be necessary for Australian growers to retain \nmarket access. \nIn addition to increased transparency and ambition around the industry’s environmental stewardship, traceability is \nalso flagged to become increasingly important, predominantly as a means to counter ‘greenwashing’, but also as \nan opportunity for growers to connect with their end-users. The industry’s new Strategic Roadmap and CRDC’s \ndigital and data strategy will be critical in helping the industry to adapt to these needs efficiently. \n  \n \n2 The Australian Agricultural Sustainability Framework - Australian Farm Institute \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 22\n \n5. Assessment of industry performance \nThis section provides a summary of GHD’s assessment of current industry action on environmental issues in light \nof the Third Environmental Assessment and the current and emerging issues identified in section 4. Consistent \nwith ToR 3, our assessment has considered the industry’s current priorities and key initiatives, on-farm practices \nand outcomes, and stakeholder concerns and perceptions on specific environmental issues. GHD’s findings, \nconclusions and recommendations are presented under the key themes of: \nx Environmental management and reporting \nx Water use and management \nx Pest management \nx Agrichemical and petrochemical storage, handling and waste \nx Natural resource management, including soils and biodiversity \nx Energy, emissions and climate. \n5.1 Environmental management and reporting \n5.1.1 Overview of key industry initiatives \nSince commissioning its first independent assessment of environmental performance in 1991, the Australian \ncotton industry’s approach to environmental management and reporting has continued to mature and evolve. The \nSecond Environmental Assessment (GHD 2003) found that the development and implementation of an industry \nBMP program was a driving factor behind improvement in environmental management observed on cotton farms \nbetween the first and second assessments. \nWhile the Third Environmental Assessment (Inovact Consulting 2012) also found considerable improvements had \nbeen made in water, chemical and natural resource management on-farm and across cotton growing regions, it \nhighlighted that increasing grower uptake of the BMP program, which by that stage been re-developed as myBMP, \nwould be a major challenge for the industry. Re-invigorating myBMP and re-appraisal of its role in industry \nassurance was one of six key recommendations arising from the Third Environmental Assessment.  \nIn response to another of the key recommendations from the Third Environmental Assessment, the Australian \ncotton industry released its first sustainability report in 2014, incorporating social, economic and environmental \nconsiderations (SWG 2014). Since this time, the industry has developed a comprehensive sustainability framework \nand reporting process, known as PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. The sustainability framework is overseen by the \nSustainability Working Group (SWG) as depicted in Figure 7. \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 23\nFigure 7 Sustainability Working Group overview. Source: SWG 2020\nIn the same year as the release of the Third Environmental Assessment (Inovact Consulting 2012), the industry \nlaunched a new extension program, CottonInfo, jointly funded by Cotton Australia, CRDC and Cotton Seed \nDistributors Ltd. \nTogether, the myBMP, CottonInfo and PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. underpinned by CRDC’s research agenda \nand Cotton Australia’ work in policy, communications and marketing, comprise the industry’s key initiatives for \nmanaging and reporting on the environmental performance of Australian cotton producers. Further information on \neach of these three initiatives is provided below.\n5.1.1.1 myBMP\nBetween the first and second environmental audits, the Australian cotton industry developed and implemented a \nBest Management Practices (BMP) program comprising of a BMP manual and audit program for assessing \ncompliance against BMP guidelines (GHD 2003). The original 1997 program was reviewed and redeveloped in \n2006-07 and relaunched as an online system titled ‘myBMP’ in 2010 (myBMP 2022). \nThe myBMP program is supported by the industry’s research, development and extension efforts, and provides \ngrowers with a range of technical support and practical tools that allows them to assess, document and monitor \ntheir performance across ten modules:\nBiosecurity \nEnergy and input efficiency\nFibre quality\nHuman resources and work health and safety\nIntegrated pest management (IPM)\nSustainable natural landscape (natural assets)\nPesticide management \nPetrochemical storage and handling\nSoil health\nWater management \nmyBMP is structured such that each module identifies key areas, against which standards are established. These \nkey areas and standards are supported by checklists, additional information, and resources. Each checklist item is \nassigned one of three levels:\nx Level 1: identified legal requirements (i.e. what you must do)\nx Level 2: industry identified best practice standards (i.e. what you should do)\nx Level 3: innovative practices (i.e. new, cutting-edge practices).\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 24\n \nFarmers may register for the voluntary program or undergo a formal audit to become certified. In this way, myBMP \nacts as the industry’s assurance mechanism, helping the industry manage risks, and providing a central access \npoint to the industry’s best practice standards. \nTo achieve certification, growers must register and undertake a self-assessment of their farm/s, and once all level \n1 and 2 checklist items have been achieved, they can request to progress through the audit process. Once \nachieved, certification remains current for five years, at which time re-certification through the audit process is \nrequired. It is noted that 10% of myBMP certified farms are randomly audited in any given year, with growers able \nto re-start the five-year certification period if they achieve compliance with the random audit. \nIn 2014, Cotton Australia was successful in achieving recognition of the myBMP program with the global Better \nCotton program. As noted in section 4.2.2, the alignment of myBMP allows growers access to the Better Cotton \nmarket, which is currently estimated to achieve a small price premium in the range of $3-$7 per bale (Cotton \nAustralia 2022b). \n5.1.1.2 CottonInfo \nCottonInfo was initiated in 2012 as a joint venture of Cotton Australia, CRDC and CSD targeting extension of \nresearch and best practice amongst growers and other industry participants in cotton. CottonInfo’s purpose is \nhighly aligned with that of myBMP, delivering research and development on best practice to inform myBMP’s \ncriteria framework for growers to voluntarily follow and achieve certification. The overarching aims of CottonInfo \nare centred around: \nx Improving industry best practice \nx Improving research and development communication \nx Improving industry responsiveness. \nThe environmental areas which CottonInfo supports industry with include nutrition, soil health, water management, \npesticide use efficiency, energy use, carbon and climate, biosecurity, disease and insect management, and natural \nresource management. CottonInfo has also published a strategic plan from 2018-2023, detailing strategic goals in: \nx Improving the rate and reach of adaptation and adoption of research and development \nx Enable successful cotton industry expansion \nx Prepared to respond to biosecurity threats and assist in the event of natural disasters \nx Provide an effective extension team, and a trusted information source. \nCottonInfo’s team includes sub-teams of; Regional Extension officers, Technical Leads, and myBMP experts. This \nteam has been designed to encourage collaboration between researchers and industry.  \n5.1.1.3 PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. \nSince the Third Environmental Assessment, Cotton Australia and the CRDC have made great strides in identifying \nand progressing towards sustainability targets, committing to review and produce an industry-wide sustainability \nreport on a regular basis to support continuous monitoring and improvement of its performance. In 2014, the \nindustry produced the first Sustainability Report which provided data on 45 social, economic and environmental \nindicators. The Sustainability Working Group (SWG) was formed in 2016 with the purpose to oversee the \nindustry’s ongoing commitment to sustainability reporting and implementation and coordinate its work to become a \nglobal leader in sustainable cotton production.  \nThe Australian cotton industry now operates within a sustainability framework – PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. \nThis framework is not a compulsory standard or brand for the industry, rather it is a framework that recognises \nsustainability as an integral part of doing business. The framework has been created to guide work to: \nx Set sustainability targets in the areas mo st important to industry and stakeholders \nx Coordinate a whole-of-industry strategy to achieve these targets \nx Engage effectively with stakeholders on actions and progress. \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 25\nIn 2018 the SWG sought feedback on draft sustainability targets from a greater stakeholder group including: cotton \nindustry representatives, the Cotton Innovation Network, research community, all levels of government, community \ngroups, agriculture RDCs, interest groups, retailers and customers, and suppliers and service providers.\nNine topics have been identified under the three key areas and these topics align with the UN SDGs. Five relate \ndirectly to the environment, including water, carbon, biodiversity, pesticides and soil health (Figure 8). \nFigure 8 Sustainability framework and alignment with the UN SDGs. Source: SWG 2021 \nThe second Sustainability Report was released in 2019, reporting on the nine priority topics and comparing \nperformance from 2014-2019. The industry has committed to 5-yearly Sustainability Reports and an annual \nsnapshot of progress being provided in between. In 2020, expert groups reviewed data from the Sustainability \nReports and drafted targets for the priority topics, with consultation underway before targets are finalised and \npublished. Some topics have a high degree of crossover with other Australian agriculture sectors and therefore \ntargets are slower to be finalised as priority is given to ensuring consistency with other agriculture sustainability \nframeworks. \n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 26\nTo support the implementation and currency of the framework, the SWG undertakes a quarterly materiality scan \nfocussed on the nine identified themes. This scan picks up on any new developments nationally and internationally \nto ensure the most up-to-date environmental and sustainability practices are discussed.\nAdditional to this work, the Australian Cotton Stakeholder Reference Group (ACSRG) was formed in late 2021. \nThis group includes representatives from cotton growers, other agricultural industries, researchers, environment \ngroups, community groups, first nations, finance, government, regulators, health and safety, input providers and \nbrands/merchants. The ACSGR meets every six months to provide a two-way exchange of information to update \nstakeholder groups on industry progress and seek feedback from stakeholders on their expectations and \nsuggestions. It is an important formal process of regular stakeholder engagement to inform Sustainability Working \nGroup decision-making.\n5.1.2 Stakeholder perceptions of the industry’s environmental \nmanagement and reporting initiatives\nAs part of the Fourth Environmental Assessment, GHD asked both growers and broader industry stakeholders \nparticipating in the respective online surveys about their awareness of PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. and the \nmyBMP program, as well as how important they considered these initiatives to be for the cotton industry.\nIt was found that there was widespread awareness (>70%) amongst the broader stakeholders participating in the \nonline survey of the myBMP program, with less recognition of the industry’s sustainability framework (42%). \nHowever, it is noted that the PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. sustainability framework was only created in 2020 \n(compared to BMP and myBMP in 1997 and 2010 respectively) and therefore has gained a level of awareness in a \nshort timeframe. The vast majority of stakeholder respondents (>80%) rated these types of initiatives as either \n‘very important’ or ‘somewhat important’ for the industry.  \nFigure 9 Stakeholder awareness of myBMP (left) and PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. (right)  \nIn comparison, there was >90% awareness of myBMP amongst growers participating in the online survey and \napproximately 56% were aware of PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. Grower awareness and attitudes toward key \nindustry programs and initiatives have also been tested over time through the annual Cotton Grower Surveys. In \nresponse to questions around myBMP in the 2019 survey, 9% of respondents indicated that they had never heard \nof or didn’t know enough about myBMP. In the 2020 survey, growers were asked questions about their \nperceptions of CRDC and CottonInfo. In response, 91% of growers indicated they were supportive of CRDC and \nits research investments and activities, and 96% agreed that CRDC is a trusted information source. Similarly 86% \nof respondents source information from the CottonInfo team or resources, and 97% agree that CottonInfo is a \ntrusted information source. In response to a question in the 2021 survey, 46% of growers responded that they \nwere aware of the industry sustainability framework, PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. As noted above, this is a \nstrong level of awareness achieved in its first year. \n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 27\n5.1.3 Grower uptake of myBMP\nDespite widespread awareness of the myBMP program and recognition of its importance to industry, certification \nlevels amongst growers is still only estimated to cover 25-30% of cotton produced in Australia. \nFigure 10 provides the number myBMP certified farms and the number of farms opting into Better Cotton as \nreported by Cotton Australia in its Annual Reports for the period 2015/16 to 2020/21. While it is noted that not all \nmyBMP certified farms will produce cotton in any given year, the figures do suggest that not all growers with \nmyBMP certification market their cotton through Better Cotton. GHD has also estimated the percentage of \nAustralian cotton that is produced under Better Cotton by comparing the volume of Better Cotton production that \ncomes from Australia, as reported in Better Cotton Annual Reports from 2017 to 2021, with the total volume of \ncotton lint production grown in Australia over the same period.\nFigure 10 Participation in myBMP and Better Cotton (sources:  Cotton Australia, Better Cotton, ABARES and GHD estimates)\nThe figures suggest that there has been a steady increase in the number of farms with myBMP certification from \nthe 116 reported in the Third Environmental Assessment (Inovact Consulting 2012). myBMP reports that the \ncurrent number of certified farms is 343, representing a further increase on the 2020/21 figure and an almost \nthree-fold increase in the ten years since 2012 (N. Scott, personal communication, October 05, 2022).\nIn contrast to the number of farms that are myBMP certified, i.e. representing around 25% of the industry, the \nnumber of growers registered and therefore likely to be making some use of its resources, is much greater. With \nthe exact number of growers in the industry not known and changing every year, it is difficult to provide a robust \nestimate of the percentage of the industry’s growers participating (in some degree) in myBMP. In the 2019 \nSustainability Report, it was reported that 66% of the Australian cotton industry were registered for myBMP (SWG\n2020). At the time of this report, myBMP indicated that there are 1,065 businesses/growers registered in myBMP. \nUsing the figure of approximately 1,500 cotton growers (total) in Australia, this equates to about 66% involvement \nin the program.\nGrowers participating in the online grower survey were asked about the barriers to myBMP adoption.\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 28\nFigure 11 Barriers to myBMP certification as identified in the online grower survey\nWhile it is recognised that the grower survey undertaken for this assessment represents a small sample size, the \nresponses around barriers to adoption are similar to those provided in the Third Environmental Assessment, as \nwell as the 2019 Cotton Grower Survey.\nGrowers participating in the on-site farm visits were also asked about barriers to adoption of myBMP, with the \nmost common response being lack of time and money. Scale also came up as a consideration and barrier to \nsome. Most, even if not certified, saw the benefit to becoming myBMP certified, with some reporting improved \nprofessionalism and credibility, and noting that certification would/does give better access to premium markets. \nHowever, some were unsure or did not know what benefits (in terms of market access and profitability) certification \nwould bring. Some grower sentiments were that myBMP should be industry standard and some thought that there \ncould be stronger benchmarks for some of the myBMP areas, including biodiversity.\nIn terms of its on-farm observations, GHD has also assessed whether myBMP status correlated with improved \nenvironmental performance across all criteria considered. As depicted in Figure 12, GHD found that there was a \nhigher number of ‘excellent’ and ‘good’ ratings across all the environmental performance criteria observed on-farm \namongst those growers with myBMP certification. Further, it was observed that those not using myBMP received \nmore ‘poor’ ratings, than those who were myBMP registered, who in turn received more ‘poor’ ratings than those \nwho were myBMP certified. That being said, close to 90% or higher of the environmental criteria observed on-farm \nwere ranked as ‘excellent’, ‘very good’ or ‘good’ across all growers, regardless of myBMP status indicating that a \nstrong level of on-farm environmental performance was observed overall.\nFigure 12 Aggregate rankings across all environmental criteria observed on-farm by myBMP status\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 29\n \n5.1.4 Conclusions and recommendations  \nGHD found that the industry has made great strides in its environmental management and reporting systems in the \nten years since the Third Environmental Assessment. Together, myBMP, CottonInfo, PLANET. PEOPLE. \nPADDOCK. (overseen by the SWG), CRDC through its investment in RD&E, and Cotton Australia’ work in policy, \ncommunications and marketing, all have a role to play in improving the management and reporting of \nenvironmental performance of cotton production in Australia. There is strong alignment and clear signs of \ncollaboration across the respective industry organisations. \nGoing forward it is important that efforts continue to drive awareness and educate growers and other industry \nstakeholders about the industry’s sustainability framework. While awareness around the industry’s myBMP \nprogram is relatively high amongst growers and stakeholders, the uptake of myBMP certification, and therefore the \nusefulness of the program in market assurance is still limited at levels of 25-30% of production. To achieve the full \nbenefits from the industry’s efforts in this area, growers themselves have an active role to play not just in \nenvironmental management on-farm, but in engaging with the industry’s sustainability agenda more broadly. \nGHD notes that while it is commendable that the industry has committed to continuous improvement, in some \ncases like water use efficiency, the rate of improvement has or will slow as it reaches maximum efficiency. It is \ntherefore important that the industry move towards science-based targets rather than pursue an impossible target \nof continuous improvement. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 30\n \n \n \n  \nRecommendations \nx Continue to undertake updates to the existi ng myBMP website to ensure all information \nis current and weblinks and video content are accessible. Regular updates to both the \nmain website and module content should be undertaken to ensure information remains \ncurrent. This will become increasingly important as module content and supporting \nresources are updated to incorporate new research and information applicable to new \ngrowing areas. \nx Continue to increase the transparency and c onsistency of reporting of the number of \ngrowers both registered and certified with the myBMP program. Subject to privacy \nconsiderations, this should include the total number of growers and/or farms, and the \ntotal area and/or volume of cotton produced by farms with myBMP certification, both in \naggregate and by region. This information should be available on the myBMP website as \nwell as reported in the relevant annual publications, e.g. the Better Cotton and Cotton \nAustralia Annual Reports. \nx Ensure a whole-of-industry co mmitment to increasing the uptake of myBMP certification. \nThis may require further research into identifying real and perceived barriers to uptake. \nFollowing this, there may be a need to develop and implement a comprehensive \ncommunications and engagement plan that incorporates regionally specific adoption \ntargets and actions for each of the supporting industry organisations. \nx Evolution and possible transformation of t he myBMP program is required over time \ntoward a performance-based tool that both adds value to participating farm businesses \nand provides clear outputs and data to support the implementation of the industry’s \nsustainability agenda. This could include considering if the platform could be used to \nmeasure and monitor the stocks of natural capital at the farm scale. \nx The sustainability framewor k and reporting process should continue to move toward \nscience-based targets, acknowledging the difficulties of achieving ambitious targets in a \ncomplex system. The SWG has already undertaken considerable work in this area and \nshould be encouraged to continue. \n \n \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 31\n \n5.2 Water use and management \n5.2.1 Industry priorities and key initiatives \nThe availability of water, its use, and impacts to water quality have consistently been priority issues for the \nAustralian cotton industry both in terms of production and environmental management. In response, the industry \nhas invested heavily in research, development and extension to improve on-farm practice in relation to water use \nand management, engaged in the development of national water policy and programs, and undertaken awareness \nand education activities to increase the understanding of how water is allocated to and used in cotton production. \nThe industry’s sustainability framework, PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK., has identified water as one of its nine \nenvironmental, economic and social topics of most importance to customers, cotton growers, industry \norganisations, regional communities and other stakeholders. The framework articulates the industry wide goal for \nwater management as delivering a continuous increase in the efficiency of water used for cotton irrigation, within \nsustainable river system and plant physiology limits. This goal has been developed to directly align with UN \nSustainable Development Goal 6.4 to substantially increase water use efficiency and ensure sustainable \nwithdrawals of freshwater, and is underpinned by a target to increase irrigated cotton water use efficiency by \n12.5% every five years. \nIndustry investment over the last decade in support of this goal has included (SWG 2020): \nx The Smarter Irrigation for Profit project, led by CR DC under the Australian Government’s Rural R&D for \nProfit program \nx Annual monitoring and benchmarking of industry-wide water productivity \nx The Keytah System Comparison, which is a grower-l ed program to assess the efficiencies of different \nirrigation systems. \nThe industry has acknowledged, however, that its target to increase irrigated water use efficiency by 12.5% every \nfive years will be difficult to achieve as the target approaches the current scientific understanding of the theoretical \nmaximum performance for megalitres of water used per bale of cotton produced. Despite this and given the \nongoing importance of water use and management, particularly in the context of a changing climate, the industry \nhas committed to the ambitious target 12.5% target in this area and has identified the following practices as key to \nachieving it (SWG n.d.a): \nx Continued adoption of practices to reduce losses in storage and transmission \nx Continued adoption of practices to improve efficiency in application. \nIn more recent years the effects of irrigation infrastructure, in particular irrigation pumps, on native fish has \nemerged as an area of focus. Fish entrainment (the removal of fish permanently from the river system via irrigation \ninfrastructure) in cotton infrastructure was rated as the highest R&D priority at the fish stewardship R&D priority \nworkshop in 2019 (Spotlight Magazine 2020). There is also potential for increased water efficiency through \naddressing this issue as less debris taken in by the pumps means less blockages/stemmed flows.  \nIn 2021 the Commonwealth Government, as part of its Northern Basin ‘Toolkit’ of environmental works and \nmeasures, provided over $26 million to the NSW and Queensland governments to run fish screening programs \nthat decrease the number of fish being removed from natural waterways by irrigation infrastructure. \nCRDC has co-invested with OzFish unlimited to assist administration of the Australian Screen Advisory Panel \n(ASAP). Currently CRDC is partnered with QLD Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to evaluate how fish \ninteract with irrigation infrastructure and flow. A new research partnership has recently been formed with Fisheries \nResearch and Development Corporation and NSW Department of Primary Industries to evaluate the capital and \noperating costs and environmental and economic benefits of fish screens for reducing fish entrainment. \nThe Trangie Nevertire Irrigation Scheme has invested in a large scale, self-cleaning, filtration/fish screening \ninfrastructure. This project was in partnership with NSW DPI Fisheries and the NSW Department of Planning, \nIndustry and Environment who have conducted research into the efficacy of this infrastructure. \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 32\n \n5.2.2 Water use and management on farm \nABS data for agricultural water use suggests that in 2020-21, cotton accounted for an estimated 17% of \nagricultural irrigation with a total 1,322,587 ML applied. Water use by irrigated agricultural industries in Australia, \nincluding cotton, continues to be the subject of public scrutiny, as has been shown through media coverage and \ncommentary from environmental and conservation groups.  \nIn considering water use by irrigated agricultural industries however, it is important to consider the drivers for on-\nfarm decision-making, which include the reliability of water entitlement, soil type, climate, farming systems, and \nreturn per ML of water applied. It is also important to note that water allocations are regulated by the relevant \ngovernment jurisdictions, such that producers will seek to maximise the return for the water they have available \nunder their given water licence in any given year. \nTable 3 provides context to the market drivers behind the amount of irrigated cotton production. For the purpose of \nthis discussion, a comparison of the return ($/ML) of different annual crop types is shown for two of the major \ncotton growing regions in Australia, the Namoi and Murrumbidgee valleys (adapted from Marsden Jacob \nAssociates 2022). The indicative gross margins explain that given a set amount of water made available by \ncatchments for agricultural use, market conditions have pushed producers operating annual cropping regimes \ntoward cotton production to achieve the highest value per ML applied with the water that is made available to \nthem.  \nTable 3: Case study of the economics of water use in annual cropping systems in the Namoi and Murrumbidgee regions \n(Marsden Jacob Associates 2022) \n \nNamoi Murrumbidgee  \nGross Margin $/ML ML/ha Gross Margin $/ML ML/ha \nCotton $350.00 6.9 $225.00 9.0 \nRice - - $175.00 11.5 \nWheat $175.00 2.3 $150.00 7.8 \nOats $150.00 3.0 $150.00 2.5 \nBarley $150.00 4.8 $150.00 4.1 \nLucerne $150.00 7.5 $150.00 3.0 \nSorghum $175.00 3.5 - - \nAs noted in section 1.1, the majority of cotton grown in Australia is irrigated, and with water typically the limiting \nresource for production, growers are incentivised to maximise the value of production relative to the volume of \nwater applied. Through a combination of sustained research and on-farm practice change, continued improvement \nin water use efficiency is one of the industry’s headline achievements since the first industry-wide environmental \nassessment was undertaken in 1991. \nSWG (2020) reported that it took 48% less water to produce a bale of irrigated cotton in 2019 than it did when \nindustry first commenced measuring its water use efficiency in 1992, representing an average 2.5% improvement \nin water use efficiency per year. \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 33\nFigure 13 5-year average water use (rainfall and applied water), ML/bale. Source: SWG n.d.a.\nFigure 13 indicates that while there has been a continued trend of improvement in water use efficiency over the \nten years since the Third Environmental Assessment, i.e. since 2012, the change has been less marked, which is \nconsistent with the industry’s own assessment that continuing to improve water use efficiency will become more \ndifficult with time, requiring increasingly more effort.\nThe industry obtains additional information about on-farm practices in relation to water use and management \nthrough CRDC’s annual Cotton Grower Surveys and Crop Consultants Australia’s annual Cotton Consultants \nSurvey.\nA review of CRDC Cotton Growers Surveys from 2018 – 2021 and Cotton Growing Practices from 2013 – 2016 \nfound that areas of focus for growers in these years were water availability, use of irrigation systems, and water \nuse efficiency. Additional areas of focus were groundwater quality and automation. In 2018, only 31% of growers \nreported monitoring groundwater quality, with 47% of those growers reporting that they monitor at least once per \nyear (CRDC 2018). 28% of growers in 2021 reported using automation, with a further 38% considering irrigation \nautomation, however 69% reported utilising sensors or automation of some kind that required digital connectivity. \nExamples of automation technologies reported were depth sensors in channels, remote operation of irrigation \nhardware such as pump and gates, and sensors combined with software (e.g. soil moisture probes) to inform \nirrigation frequency. Developments in automation have been backed by research, such as that undertaken by the \nCRDC Smarter Irrigation for Profit Phase 2 project. While this project is in its early stages at the time of writing, \nsub-projects funded focus on new irrigation technologies such as advanced sensors and analytics to improve \nirrigation scheduling and reduce water loss. Automation was not discussed in the Third Environmental Assessment \n(Inovact Consulting 2012), indicating that it is a novel management technique for the industry.\nWater capture/extraction and water loss were areas of focus in the Cotton Growers Survey 2021, with 46% \nreporting using water on other crops or reporting operational losses. The Cotton Growers Survey 2021 reported \nthat 82% of growers use some practices to minimise water loss with 29% using three or more practices. Practices \nincluded transferring water, raising storages height or dividing storages into cells, tracking water use in software, \nand lining storages/channels. Transfer of water was the most common method of mitigating water loss (65%). \nThe water management module in myBMP provides information and checklists to support growers to achieve best \npractice in water use and management, and assurance of best management practice amongst those growers who \nhave achieved myBMP certification. The standards to be achieved under the water management module are:\nx Information is recorded each season to help make better whole-farm irrigation decisions\nx Information is used each season to help make better field irrigation decisions\nx Practices are used for efficient management of storage and distribution systems\nx Surface irrigation systems are designed, installed and managed appropriately\nx Drip irrigation systems are designed, installed and managed appropriately\nx Centre Pivot and Lateral Move irrigation systems are designed, installed and managed appropriately\nx Irrigation bore systems are designed, installed and managed appropriately\nx Practices are used to take advantage of rainfall\nx Management strategies are implemented to prevent off-farm water quality impacts\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 34\nx Plans are developed and implemented to manage the impact of tailwater and stormwater runoff off-farm.\nGHD observed that water use was monitored thoroughly on the farms throughout the cotton growing regions \nwhere on-site farm visits were undertaken. Most growers, regardless of myBMP status, were also found to take \nadvantage of information from canopy temperature sensors, moisture probes, on-farm weather stations, and \nsoftware for irrigation scheduling. Figure 14 provides a summary of the on-farm observations by region and \nmyBMP status relating to water use and management.\nFigure 14 On-farm observations relating to water use and management by region and myBMP status\nAn analysis of the on-farm observations for water by myBMP status alone, shows that there were no ‘poor’ ratings \nin the area of water management and use for myBMP certified growers. This comparison also shows that with only \none poor rating received in the water management use categories for each of the non-myBMP and myBMP \nregistered, on-farm observations were in the main rated as ‘good’ or above, regardless of myBMP status.\n5.2.3 Stakeholder perceptions of  water use and management\nThe environmental implications of water use and management have been found to be of considerable public \ninterest during all four of the industry’s environmental assessments. At the time of the Third Environmental \nAssessment (2012), it was noted that water scarcity during the millennium drought had triggered a new wave of \ninvestment in water programs, as well as a range of policy, institutional and regulatory reforms. It further identified \ncontinued long-term pressure on Australia’s water resources, and in particular, the development and \nimplementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, as one of the priority areas for future industry action to improve \nenvironmental outcomes. \nWhile it is important to note that water use for irrigation is regulated by governments, there is continued public \ninterest and scrutiny on the industries that rely on access to irrigation water, including cotton. The Communities \nTrust in Australia’s Rural Industries Report 2022(Voconiq 2022) supports the public interest in water use with the \nview that water should only be given to agricultural industries after the environmental needs are met. Interestingly \nthough, the relative importance of this metric has dropped in the last 2 years as water availability has increased. \nAs noted in section Current and emerging issues4, water was ranked as the highest current and emerging issue \nby both growers and stakeholders participating in the online surveys as part of this assessment. This is consistent \nwith grower and stakeholder survey undertaken for the Third Environmental Assessment.\nGrowers and stakeholders were also asked to rate the performance of the Australian cotton industry in respect to \nspecific on-farm practices and environmental issues. Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the stakeholder and grower \nresponses related to water use and management. The responses suggest that stakeholders are generally aware \n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 35\nof the improvements the industry has made in irrigation practices and water use efficiency, with more than 50% \nrating this as ‘very good’ or ‘good’. The areas where the perception of practice was poorest were ‘reducing run-off \nto rivers and wetland’, ‘compliance with water licenses and extraction limits’ and ‘management of water storages’. \nApproximately one-third of respondents felt they didn’t know or were unsure in relation to ‘tailwater and stormwater \nmanagement’.\nFigure 15 Stakeholder questionnaire responses related to current water use and management\nIn contrast, growers were more positive in relation to industry water use and management practices, with all \npractices typically perceived to be ‘very good’ or ‘good’. \nFigure 16 Grower questionnaire responses related to current water use and management\n5.2.4 Conclusions and recommendations\nWater use and management is an area of considerable industry effort and demonstrable on-farm improvement \nover many years, with GHD’s assessment supporting this. Despite this, water remains highly contentious amongst \nstakeholders, and has been subject to continued policy and regulatory change over the ten years since the \nprevious assessment, with these external pressures likely to continue. In addition to its RD&E efforts, the industry \nwill need to continue its engagement with the national water reform agenda – pressure points for the industry will \ninclude an ongoing focus on compliance (including metering and monitoring), implementation of floodplain \nharvesting policies and program, expansion of irrigation in Northern Australia, and further implementation and \nreview of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Governments have a role to play in the provision of information and data \non the use of water resources in Australia, including increasing the education and awareness of the regulation and \ncompliance measures that are in place for water extraction. The issue of fish entrainment has also emerged in \nrecent years as an environmental issue that has gained prominence, with the industry commencing new research \nwork to better understand the likely implications for on-farm management.\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 36\n \n \n \n  \nRecommendations \nx Continue to work with the respective gov ernment agencies to include, where available, \ninformation on the status of water compliance in major cotton growing regions (e.g. \nnumber/size of breaches compared to total number of holdings) in industry sustainability \nreporting, as was flagged in the 2020 stakeholder consultation report on the setting of \nindustry targets and indicators for the Australian cotton industry. \nx Continue to support research and trial work that is underway to better understand the \nimpacts of fish entrainment and encourage broader adoption by cotton growers and \ninfrastructure operators of screening on irrigation pumps and/or other identified mitigation \nmeasures. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 37\n \n5.3 Pest management \n5.3.1 Industry priorities and key initiatives \n5.3.1.1 Pest management strategies \nPest management in agriculture has historically been centred around the application of pesticides. From the \n1960’s to early 2000’s, Australian cotton production was heavily reliant on the use of pesticides, and those used \nwere largely broad spectrum, non-specific in nature such as organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids and \nwell as endosulfan (Wilson et al. 2013). In 1996, the first insect-resistant transgenic cotton varieties were \ncommercially released in Australia, known as Ingard®, for the control of both Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa \narmigera) and Native budworm (Helicoverpa punctigera). The development of insect-resistant transgenic cotton \nchanged the face of pest management in the Australian cotton industry and has continued to be instrumental to \nthis day.  \nSince the Third Environmental Assessment in 2012, the third iteration of this technology, Bollgard 3®, has been \nintroduced. This consistent iteration to add expression of additional proteins makes it increasingly difficult for the \npest to develop resistance. The technology is the cornerstone of strong pest management practices on-farm with \nimplementation in 99% of the Australian cotton crop (Cotton Australia 2022c). The adoption of transgenic cotton in \npest management and implementation of the associated Regional Management Plans (RMPs) on-farm has \nprovided an ideal platform for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies to provide continued improvement in \npest management by greatly reducing insecticide use for the target pest species. IPM aims to reduce insecticide \nuse while maintaining profitability of cotton crops by promoting natural control from beneficial insects while \nsupressing pests.  \nSupporting pest and weed management is management of biosecurity, to prevent the entry, spread and \nestablishment of invasive pest species. Biosecurity practices are integral to pest, weed and disease management \nparticularly in managing outbreaks or incursions.  \n5.3.1.2 Pesticide and agrichemical use \nThe use of pesticides is a key sustainability area for the cotton industry, with the current goal for pesticide use to \nsupport optimal crop production while having no negative impact on human or environmental health. The target for \nthe cotton industry is to reduce the environmental impact of pesticides by five per cent, every five years.  \nThe Australian Cotton industry has worked hard to decrease the hazard and volume of pesticides used, with a \n18.2% decrease between 2014-2019 (SWG 2020). While insecticide use has been significantly reduced due to the \nintroduction of Bt cotton and implementation of IPM strategies, over the same period there has been a 20% \nincrease in herbicide use. Despite the increased volume of herbicides, the overall Environmental Toxic Load (ETL) \nhas reduced dramatically and represents the more targeted approach to herbicide use adopted by the industry to \nreduce the environmental impact of herbicide use.  \nEnvironmental Toxic Load (ETL) has been created specifically to assess human health and environmental hazards \nassociated with pesticides used in cotton. ETL represents the average amount of toxic pressure by the pesticide \napplied on one hectare of cotton in one year, based on the volume sold. ETL monitors the hazard to four different \necological components. For simplicity, the industry uses two of these as a public sustainability target: bees for \ninsecticide hazard and algae for herbicide hazard.  \nInsecticides, herbicides and chemical fertilisers are a significant input cost for successful cotton growing but \nrequire appropriate management to ensure that environmental health is maintained. The inappropriate use of \nthese chemicals can cause contamination of the environment through flushing into waterbodies and seepage into \nground water, and also result in significant production losses in the case of spray drift. \nA number of crops grown throughout cotton growing regions of Australia, including cotton itself, are sensitive to \nspray drift, with cotton particularly sensitive to spray drift from Group I herbicides. In 2018, the impact of spray drift, \naffecting only 10% of the summer crop, summed an estimated $18 million in production losses (Cotton Australia \n2022d). \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 38\n \nIn the period since the last environmental assessment in 2012, the industry has established further tools and \nresources to reduce the economic impact and subsequent environmental impact of spray drift. In 2018, a group of \nconcerned parties formed a committee called ‘Stop Off-target Spraying’ (SOS) which received overwhelming \nsupport from the industry and bore the first SOS group, SOS Maquarie Valley Inc. The SOS group has grown to \nnow incorporate other regions across NSW, engaging with the agricultural community to increase awareness of \noff-target spraying (SOS NSW 2020). For the 2019-20 summer season, following a successful trial in Qld’s Central \nHighlands, Satacrop became available for use by growers. SataCrop is a tool to mitigate the risk of spray drift by \nallowing operators to understand where sensitive crops (not restricted to cotton) are located in proximity to their \nspray operation. The SataCrop tool is an industry initiative developed by Cotton Australia and Precision Cropping \nTechnologies (PCT). Additionally, the Grains Research and Development Corporation and CRDC, in partnership \nwith private industry, are in the final stages of developing a spray drift hazardous weather warning system that will \nprovide real-time weather data and alerts to growers and spray operators about the presence of temperature \ninversions (CRDC 2022). \n5.3.2 Pest management on farm \nOn farm, the cotton industry’s adoption of round-up ready (herbicide resistant) and Bt (pest resistant) transgenic \ncotton varieties over the past 20 years has driven strong understanding and awareness of herbicide and \ninsecticide resistance. Farmers are working closely with their agronomists to look for innovative ways to manage \npests, weeds and disease throughout the season. Many farmers noted the adoption of Bt cotton has minimised \nunintended harm to beneficials during spray practices by allowing more targeted insecticides to be used and \ndecreasing frequency of insecticide use.  \nBiosecurity is a key component of pest management for cotton growers, with 84% of growers surveyed in the \nCotton Growers Survey 2021 using at least one biosecurity management practice and 56% of farms holding a farm \nbiosecurity plan. While all growers participating in the grower survey for this assessment rated the industry’s \nunderstanding and awareness of biosecurity practices as ‘good’ or ‘very good’, the results of the Cotton Growers \nSurvey 2021 found that 16% of farmers surveyed are not using practices to manage their farm biosecurity \nindicating there is still room for improvement, particularly in implementation and planning.  \nGHD observed that growers had a sound understanding of the role of IPM in crop management with several farms \nvisited actively engaging with their agronomist to implement IPM not only for decreasing input costs by lowering \ninsecticide use but also to ensure long-term environmental benefits. Many farmers were consciously retaining \nnative and remnant vegetation as habitat for beneficials and understood the benefit to their production system to \nmanage beneficial insects effectively.  \nMinimal ‘poor’ ratings were recorded in relation to pest management (refer Figure 17), and these were each \nattributed to biosecurity practices. Vehicle and machinery washdown, biosecurity signage and visitor records are \nvital to effective pest, weed and disease management. These strategies are particularly important when outbreaks \noccur or new pests, weeds or diseases are introduced, spreading, and establishing. Pest management was \nobserved as being particularly strong (i.e. ‘very good’ or ‘excellent’ ratings) in the Northern NSW/Southern QLD \nand Southern NSW regions. \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 39\nFigure 17 On-farm observations relating to pest management by region and myBMP status\nSimilar to the on-farm observations for water use and management, GHD observed widespread ‘good’ practice in \nrelation to pest management regardless of myBMP status. \n5.3.3 Stakeholder percepti on of pest management\nPest management is an area of significant industry progress and demonstrated on-farm improvement over the \nyears of environmental assessments. The increased uptake of IPM was identified in the Third Environmental \nAssessment (Inovact Consulting 2012) as a major achievement for the cotton industry in reducing pesticide use \nand undertaking biodiversity conservation, however it reported that only 3% of growers at the time considered IPM \na ‘top environmental priority’, compared with 15% for pesticide/herbicide use/management. However, the grower \nperception survey included in the Third Environmental Assessment found that 95% of growers attributed major or \nsmaller worthwhile improvements in chemical management to adoption of IPM.\nThe grower survey for this assessment suggests continued improved performance in pest management over the \n10-year period. 94% of respondents to the grower survey rated IPM and pesticide reduction overall industry \nperformance as ‘good’ or ‘very good'. 88% rated the improvement in IPM practices over the 10-year period as \n‘good’ to ‘very good’, and 94% ‘good’ to ‘very good’ improvement in pesticide and chemical use generally.\nAll growers surveyed rated the industry’s overall environmental performance to manage and reduce spray drift as \n‘good’ to ‘very good’. On-farm many growers noted their agronomists registering their crops on SataCrop and most \nnoted that issues with spray drift were not common but mostly occurred from neighbours with non-sensitive crops.\nFigure 18 Grower questionnaire responses related to current pest management practices\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 40\nRespondents to this Assessment’s stakeholder survey indicated a greater awareness of the reduction of pesticide \nuse and implementation of IPM practices, presenting a more positive perception when compared with other \nenvironmental categories assessed.\nFigure 19 Stakeholder questionnaire responses re lated to current pest management practices\n5.3.4 Conclusions and recommendations\nThe industry has made continual progress in this area, with pesticide use significantly reduced (due to the \nintroduction of Bt cotton and implementation of IPM strategies), and a decrease in overall Environmental Toxic \nLoad (ETL), representing a more targeted approach to herbicide use in efforts to reduce the environmental impact.\nFarmers are working closely with their agronomists to look for innovative ways to manage pests, weeds and \ndisease throughout the season with many farmers retaining native and remnant vegetation as habitat for \nbeneficials, noting the benefit to their production. Biosecurity is a concern for growers, with over 50% of farms \nhaving a farm biosecurity plan, however there is room for improvement in this (biosecurity) area. \n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 41\n \n \n \n  \nRecommendations \nx Use regionally targeted approaches to incr ease the level of biosecurity planning to \nensure sound biosecurity practices are in place on-farm. There is room for improvement \nin this area to ensure that growers are prepared and have strategies already in place for \nany future outbreaks of new pests, weeds or diseases.  \nx Continue to work with the broader agricultu ral community to increase the understanding \nand awareness of off-target spraying to minimise the potential for environmental \nimpacts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 42\n \n5.4 Agrichemical and petrochemical storage, handling \nand waste \n5.4.1 Industry priorities and key initiatives \nThe appropriate storage and handling of agrichemicals (such as fertiliser, pesticide, herbicide etc.), petrochemicals \nand waste products reduces the environmental risk posed by these products and associated activities. These \nproducts have the potential to contaminate soils, waterways and release pollutants to the air which can be \npersistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Due to the highly persistent nature of some of these compounds they can \naccumulate in soils, sediments and organisms in the environment. Activities that can lead to contamination on \nagricultural land include:  \nx Disposal of wastes (controlled and uncontrolled) \nx Accidental spillage  \nx Storage or transportation of raw materials, finished products or wastes \nx Migration of contaminants into a site from neighbo uring land, as vapour, leachate. Movement of liquids \nthrough the soil or as dust and other particles \nx Use of agricultural chemicals (Barzi et al. 1996). \nThe open burning of agricultural waste, including drums used for agrichemical storage, crude oil and general \nwaste in on-farm landfills also results in significant emissions of air pollutants (Lemieux et al. 2004). \nAccidental spillage to ground occurs when safety measures such as bunding around fuel storage are not in place. \nLike the overuse of agrichemicals, spills can result in contamination not only of the immediate land but can be \ntransported off-farm through surface and groundwater movement. Contamination with chemical compounds affects \nthe functioning of the soil habitat, reducing soil biodiversity, and soil quality (Gworek et al. 2018). \nContamination can be caused by:  \nx Inorganic compounds \nx Organic chemicals \nx Oils and tars \nx Combustible substances \nx Hazardous wastes \nx Toxic, explosive or asphyxiant gases (including from t he decomposition of waste in landfills) (Barzi et al. \n1996). \nPetrochemical storage and handling is a module within the myBMP program, with storage, handling and waste \nmanagement practices also contained within the Pesticide management module. Currently there are no explicit \ngoals, indicators or targets established for storage, handling and waste management practices within the industry’s \nsustainability framework and reporting. \n5.4.2 Storage, handling and waste on farm \nThe Third Environmental Assessment did not focus on storage, handling and waste, however concluded that all \nrecommendations of the 2002 assessment were implemented. The on-farm assessments conducted for the 2022 \nenvironmental assessment found that this area of environmental management demonstrated the poorest \nperformance with little to no improvement between the 2002 assessment and 2022 assessment.  \nCriteria relating to storage handling and waste practices received the highest number of ‘poor’ ratings in the on-\nfarm assessment process (Figure 20). GHD observed a number of key areas for improvement throughout the on-\nfarm assessments including:  \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 43\nx Bunding of storages\nx Chemical storage and segregation\nx Waste management\nFigure 20 On-farm observations related to storage, handling and waste by region and myBMP status\nThis was an area where there was a clear correlation observed of improved practice for myBMP certified farms \nwhen compared to non-myBMP farms. It should also be noted however, that it was the area where the highest \nnumber of ‘poor’ ratings were observed on myBMP certified farms across all valleys.\nMany growers felt that the implementation of storage, handling and waste strategies were cost prohibitive, \nparticularly as they do not directly correlate with productivity or profitability. Despite this, a number of growers were \nprogressively upgrading storages across their property to varying degrees. Both fuel and waste oil storages were \noften unbunded and showed evidence of past spillage to ground with spill kits not always available or in an \nappropriate location. \nThe cost prohibitive nature of upgrading storage, handling and waste infrastructure on-farm is consequently \ninhibiting myBMP uptake for some growers. The improvement in storage, handling and waste management \npractices by myBMP participants can be seen in each region with a decrease in the prevalence of poor \nperformance indicators. Where this change is less evident is in the Central Queensland region where poor \nperformance was negligible, and can be attributed to a relatively good regional waste management network that is \ndiscussed in detail in the Case Study: Collaboration for effective waste management (page 46). Particularly in the \nSouthern NSW and Macquarie regions, on-farm tips were prevalent. \nChemical storage and segregation was also variable across on-farm assessments, with many growers unsure of \nthe correct segregation requirements, and only some showing compatible hazardous substance diamond placards\non the outside of storages. Only one grower had a chemical storage segregation chart available in the storage \nshed. Growers were very receptive to feedback in this area and eager to understand correct procedures. \n5.4.3 Stakeholder perceptions of storage, handling and waste\nStakeholders did not demonstrate a strong focus or visibility in this area, evidenced by the high proportion of ‘don’t \nknow/unsure’ responses. Where stakeholders did provide an indication of the views on industry performance in \nthis area, it was generally positive. However,the online grower survey undertaken for this Assessment showed that \n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 44\nthere is also a considerable disconnect between the grower perception of the current industry performance and the\non-farm practices observed.\nFigure 21 Stakeholder questionnaire responses related to current storage, handling and waste practices\nFigure 22 Grower questionnaire responses related to current storage, handling and waste practices\n5.4.4 Conclusions and recommendations\nGHD found that storage, handling and waste management is an area for improvement across the industry. Cost \nwas found to be the biggest barrier to growers improving their storage, handling and waste management, \nparticularly as these activities do not directly correlate with productivity or profitability. Additionally, the cost \nprohibitive nature of upgrading storage, handling and waste infrastructure on -farm is consequently inhibiting \nmyBMP uptake for some growers. In areas where supporting waste infrastructure is unavailable or not accessible\nor convenient, growers have poorer waste management practices. There is a need for increased focus and \nsupport to lead to on-farm improvements in this area. As these practices are not isolated to cotton production, \nthere is a role for other agricultural industries and local government, or other local service providers, to increase \nfocus in this area to lead to the necessary on-farm improvements.\nDespite GHD’s on-farm observations, this was not identified as an area of particular concern in stakeholder \nconsultation and is not currently reported on in the industry’s sustainability framework. With the transition to a \ncircular economy becoming an increasing area of focus for governments, stakeholder perceptions around waste \nmanagement in particular may become more important into the future.\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 45\n \n \n \n  \nRecommendations \nx Engage partner industries and service provider s to aid improvement in on-farm storage, \nhandling and waste practices.  \nx Undertake regionally target ed education and awareness campaigns to improve storage, \nhandling and waste practices on farm. This should be supported by the industry's broader \nextension and myBMP programs. \nx The SWG should undertake a materiality asse ssment of waste management to consider if \ntargets and indicators, or other explicit reporting of industry performance in this area is \nrequired. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 46\nCase study: Collaboration for effective waste \nmanagement\nOn farm waste management is governed not only by individual best management practice but also waste \nmanagement infrastructure in the areas that farms operate. Waste management trends were therefore \nevident at a regional scale, with quality of waste management practice varying greatly between growing \nregions. Supporting infrastructure for waste management on-farm across the growing regions came from:\nx DrumMuster\nx ChemClear / ChemCollect\nx Local tips general and segregated waste collection\nx Independent services for waste oil and rags collection\nx Local agrichemical suppliers\nThe support this infrastructure provides to farmers to implement best practice was evident through the \nregional breakdown of observations on-farm. \nIn the Southern NSW region where external support of waste management was seen as unavailable, \ncost prohibitive and time consuming, they were not utilised effectively and resulted in a reduction in\nquality waste management on-farm. This was observed through the increased presence of on-farm tips, \nburning of drums and other on-farm waste material. The lack of supporting waste management services \nwas noted as a key reason for poor performance in this area. This is emphasised when contrasted with \nthe Central QLD region where access constraints are relatively low, and no instances of poor waste \nmanagement performance were observed. In the Central QLD region, growers spoke highly of the \nregional DrumMuster and had local services easily available for waste oil collection. The barrier to access \nwaste management services was reduced, lowering perceived effort to participate, making the integration \nof best management practice easy to adopt on-farm.\nImplementation of best practice waste management does not directly correlate to profitability on farm as it \ndoes not affect yield or quality of cotton produced. Waste management therefore needs to be accessible and \naffordable to invite participation and deliver positive outcomes.\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 47\n \n5.5 Natural resource management \nNatural resource management on-farm encompasses practices that promote soil health, biodiversity, regeneration \nof vegetation and management of native and remnant vegetation, and awareness of and positive management of \necological values present on-farm. Farmers are stewards of the land on which they operate, with management of \nnatural resource fundamental to balancing the farmed/managed environment. \n5.5.1 Soil health and biodiversity management \n5.5.1.1 Soils \nSoil health has a number of definitions in the literature particularly as knowledge of the soil resource has \ndeveloped. Soil health in the context of natural resource management can be defined as ‘the soils ability to \nperform its functions and ecosystem services sustainably’.  \nThe soil provides a number of functions (CEC 2006) which are reliant on soil health to function effectively. These \ninclude:  \nx Biomass production \nx Storing, filtering & transforming of  nutrients, substances and water \nx Biodiversity pool \nx Physical and cultural environment \nx Source of raw materials \nx Acting as a carbon pool \nx Archive of geological and cultural heritage. \nManaging the soil resource to optimise soil function and health contributes more broadly to natural resource \nmanagement across global challenges (Table 4). Effective management of the soil resource is integral to \nsustainable farming practices. \nTable 4: The relationship of the six global challenges supported through the seven soil functions. Table reproduced from \nField (2017) based on McBratney et al. (2014) \nGlobal challenges Role of the soil functions \nFood security The quantity, quality and accessibility of  food are affected by having soil that can produce an \nadequate biomass (1) through the soil being able to store, filter and transform nutrients, \nsubstances and water (2) and avoiding contamination \nWater security Soil contributes to clean water by storing, filtering and transforming nutrients, substances and \nwater (2) \nEnergy security The use of plants for energy  is supported by soil’s ability to produce biomass (1) linked with \nstoring, filtering and transforming nutrients, substances and water (2) but may not be \nsynergistic with food production and sustainable water use  \nBiodiversity Soil has the largest biodiversity pool, demonstrated through the diversity of habitats, species \nand genes (3) enabling plant growth and recycling of waste and a source of products that \nbenefit human and ecosystem health \nHuman health In addition to the security of food and water and the potential resources that can be gained \nfrom maintaining a diverse gene pool in soil, human health is also supported through the \nprovision of physical and cultural environments for their activities (4). Also, being an archive \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 48\n \nof geological and archaeological heritage (7) provides an opportunity for connecting with \nhistory or cultural identity, all of which contributes to well being \nClimate change Soil acts as a pool for organic carbon (6), which contributes to the reduction of greenhouse \ngases, the use of soil as a resource for raw materials (5) is a concern as this removes a \npotential sink for carbon \n5.5.1.2 Biodiversity \nOn average, about 21% of the area of a cotton farm has remnant native vegetation, and about 4% is managed for \nbiodiversity (SWG 2020). Homogenisation of agricultural landscapes and historic land clearing has caused \nfragmentation of the landscape to the detriment of biodiversity. Where vegetation has been retained, it is often on \nthe least productive land with additional pressures to biodiversity including grazing, exotic weed invasion, feral \npests such as rabbits, changes to fire regimes, dryland salinity, and soil erosion (Gagic et al. 2018). Biodiversity \nsupports many ecosystem functions that can not only be beneficial to human wellbeing but also more broadly to \nagricultural land management including carbon sequestration, decomposition and pest control (Macfadyen et al. \n2012). The response of Australian native organisms to agricultural land use intensity is a function of their mobility \nand habitat specificity (Figure 23). \n \nFigure 23 The response of Australian native organisms to agricultural land use as presented in Smith et al. (2013) \nRemnant vegetation (as opposed to revegetation) continues to be the vegetation type with greatest biodiversity \nand ecological value in agricultural landscapes. However, remnant vegetation is managed at a local scale \n(individual land holders) for ecological values, where biodiversity occurs at a large spatial scale and provides \nlandscape connectivity for biodiversity conservation. Despite this, there are clear benefits of remnant vegetation in \nagricultural landscapes including carbon sequestration, flood mitigation and erosion management, particularly \nalong slopes and banks, and pest control (MacFadyen et al. 2012).  \n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 49\n \nIn agricultural landscapes the retention of native remnant vegetation is crucial in maintaining populations of \nbeneficial insects (Schellhorn 2010). Native plants within non-crop habitats such as remnant vegetation patches \nhave shown to have low occurrence of pests and high occurrence of their natural enemies (Gagic et al. 2018). This \nis particularly prevalent where woody vegetation is in good condition and has a mid and understorey with good \nground cover (Gagic et al. 2018). \nCharacteristics of remnant and native vegetation habitats such as structural complexity, diversity and disturbance \naffect the abundance and diversity of organisms (Gagic et al. 2018; Lentini et al. 2012; Munro et al. 2007). \nRevegetation as part of on-farm management to enhance biodiversity takes time to develop the level of floristic \ndiversity and structural complexity present in remnant vegetation patches, with organisms differing in time taken to \nrecolonise (Munro et al. 2007). Revegetation will be important in meeting the cotton industry goal for biodiversity to \nimprove biodiversity condition on farms across the cotton landscape. It provides a whole of industry approach that \ncan meet the large spatial scale that presents a challenge to improving biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. \n5.5.2 Industry priorities and key initiatives \nThe cotton industry is undertaking a number of projects in this area as part of its commitment to the sustainability \ngoals developed as part of the PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. initiative.  \nThe cotton industry sustainability goal for soil health is to deliver sustained cotton productivity growth by improving \nsoil health. Currently, there is no standardised approach to soil monitoring and evaluation at a national level, as \npart of the National Soil Strategy released in 2021 it is intended to deliver nationally consistent KPIs and methods \nto measure and report soil conditions. The industry has committed to working to progress this objective, such that \nit is able to establish clear indicators and targets for soil management. In the interim, it has developed a soil health \nframework that aims to take the complexity out of soil health, and encourage growers to follow two key principles \n(provide food and shelter to soils), which will improve soil health, regardless of how soil health is ultimately \nmeasured. \nSimilarly with biodiversity, the industry has set a goal to improve biodiversity condition on farms and across the \ncotton landscape but at this stage the goal does not have associated indicators and targets. The industry is \nworking with other stakeholders to test approaches to measuring change in biodiversity condition at the industry \nscale. \nThe soil health and biodiversity natural resource management areas are a focus for cross-sector initiatives \nincluding participation in the Australian Agricultural Sustainability Framework project being coordinated by National \nFarmers’ Federation to identify consistent indicators for biodiversity targets, and partnerships such as a project \nbetween Country Road, Landcare and the Australian cotton industry which saw 34 hectares of land revegetated in \n2020/21. \nIn 2020 a CRDC-funded project began to monitor native vegetation sites to support landholders to improve \nbiodiversity. The project sites were established by CottonInfo Regional Extension Officers (REOs) with regional \nnatural resource management groups and universities collaborating to assist with monitoring and technical advice. \nThe project aims to understand the challenges and gains for biodiversity and the farm business resulting from \nvegetation management actions and identify potential funding opportunities to assist landholders in implementing \nland practice change.  \n5.5.3 Natural resource management on farm \nThe Cotton Grower Survey 2021 found there are significant variations in native and remnant vegetation areas \nbetween regions and farm sizes and this was supported during GHD’s on-farm assessments. The Cotton Growers \nSurvey 2021 found that, on average, only 3% of total farm area is native vegetation that is not usually grazed. \nMore than 2/3 (69%) growers report having a riparian area on their property. \nGrowers visited in the central Queensland region reported that many properties were part of the Queensland \ngovernments’ historic land ballots. Compliance with the ballot system involved the removal of trees and was the \nresult of policies to encourage the more intensive use of agricultural land. This has resulted in many properties \nhaving little to no remnant vegetation while also generally being smaller in size relative to other growing regions. \nDespite this, all growers in central Queensland that were visited for on-farm assessment were engaged in soil \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 50\nmanagement strategies including stubble retention, crop rotations, and cover cropping and were managing \nremnant vegetation where present. \nOn-farm common practice for the majority of farms visited included:\nx Monitoring soil moisture using in field probes (the number of these per hectare varied)\nx Crop rotations\nx Minimum till practices\nx Regular soil testing through their agronomist.\nThere was variation between farms in how soil management techniques were implemented. For example where \ngrowers were retaining stubble between rotations some farmers were then incorporating the organic matter into \nthe soil using tillage just prior to sowing, where others were using direct drill methods to plant directly into stubble. \nLess common practices included:\nx Cover cropping\nx Controlled traffic farming\nx Application of soil conditioners/ameliorants outside NPK fertiliser as directed by agronomists.\nThe aggregate of the ratings for criteria relating to natural resource management (i.e. soils and biodiversity) are \nshown in Figure 24 by myBMP and region visited. Observations of ‘very good’ were dominant in the Northern NSW \n/ Southern QLD and Southern NSW areas. Some ratings of ‘poor’ were observed on myBMP-registered and non-\nmyBMP farms in the Macquarie valley though it is noted this is a small sample size.\nFigure 24 On-farm observations relating to natural resource management by region and myBMP status\n5.5.4 Stakeholder perceptions of  natural resource management\nStakeholder interest in biodiversity generally has increased relative to the Third Environmental Assessment in \n2012. This is reflective of the global and domestic trends and pressures in this area. Stakeholders participating in \nthe online survey for this assessment, indicated that there is a generally negative perception around ‘protection of \nriparian area’, ‘increased plantings and/or conservation of native vegetation’ and less so in respect to \n‘management of environmental weeds and feral pests’ and ‘practices to conserve or improve soil health’. \nApproximately 20% of stakeholders provided a ‘don’t know/unsure’ response in relation to the industry’s \nperformance in these areas.\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 51\nFigure 25 Stakeholder questionnaire responses rela ted to current natural resource management\nThe CRDC-commissioned 2019 report on the Perceptions of Strategies to Strengthen Biodiversity Management –\nPerspectives from the Cotton Industry found that 62.5% of respondents agreed that biodiversity loss was a serious \nissue in Australia (Dean and Uebel 2021). This was not a universal perception however, with some participants not \nin agreement with statements in this area. Some of the main challenges identified in improving biodiversity in \ngeneral were the lack of a clear definition of biodiversity and tangible goals. There is a want by participants “to do \nthe right thing” but the need for support which participants identified would need be strongly supported through\nindustry leadership.  \nIn the grower survey conducted for this assessment, 100% of growers felt that the current overall industry \nperformance was ‘good’ to ‘very good’ for ‘protection of riparian areas’. There was some (<10%) feeling that the \n‘management of environmental weeds and feral pests’ was poor. \nGrowers surveyed further indicated the current industry performance to conserve and improve soil health and \nnative vegetation still has room for improvement with 12.5% of growers indicating performance as poor. Further to \nthat, when asked about the industry’s improvement in soil health conservation practices over the 10-year period,\n19% indicated improvement was ‘poor’.\nFigure 26 Grower questionnaire responses related to current natural resource management\n5.5.5 Conclusions and recommendations\nGHD found that there is a strong understanding of the importance of soil health and its overall benefits to\nproductivity amongst cotton growers, and to a lesser extent the benefits of remnant vegetation and riparian areas.\nOften where vegetation is retained, this is on the least productive land and faces additional pressures including \ngrazing, exotic weed invasion, feral pests, changes to fire regimes, dryland salinity, and soil erosion. Broader \nstakeholder interest in biodiversity has increased since the Third Environmental Assessment and this is expected \nto continue with the introduction of a new Global Biodiversity Framework. GHD observed that the industry is \nundertaking a number of projects regarding soil health and biodiversity, alongside broader agricultural initiatives. \nParticular attention should be given to stakeholder concerns around biodiversity and native vegetation \nmanagement as the industry continues its expansion in Northern Australia.\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 52\n \n \n \n  \nRecommendations \nx Continue cross sector work to establish indicators and targets for biodiversity and soil, \nincluding continuing industry specific investigations on nitrogen use and links to \nemissions. \nx Increase extension efforts to assist gr ower understanding and awareness of how they \ncan increase their natural capital on farm. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 53\nCase study: Excellence and innovation in \nnatural resource management\nNatural resource management on farm is fundamental to a balanced managed ecosystem. It encompasses \npractices that promote soil health, regeneration of vegetation and management of native and remnant \nvegetation, and awareness of and positive management of ecological values present on-farm. Across the \ngrowing regions there are private farms utilising technology and driving innovation for natural resource \nmanagement in their businesses. \nCotton composting and cover cropping for soil health\nIn Queensland, the combination of a cotton farm and a composting business has resulted in net benefit for \nthe farmed environment, particularly soil health. The composting business uses crop waste and transforms it \ninto a soil conditioner to be reapplied across the farm. The benefits of this have compounded over the 12 \nyears of ownership of the property and has allowed the composting business to expand while fostering \nexcellence in soil management in the cotton enterprise. The benefits of the use of the compost seen on farm \nincluded:\nx Improved soil structure\nx Improved soil chemistry resulting in reduced fertilizer use\nx Increased soil water retention\nx Increased soil organic matter (SOM)\nx Reduced erosion risk\nThe application of compost to the soil is coupled with cover cropping and a no-till system (outside what is \nrequired for the technology user agreement) to ensure maximum benefit to the soil. After the cotton season,\ncompost is applied and radish is sown to improve soil structure and improve organic matter. \nDigital solutions for natural resource \nmanagement\nAdvances in technology over the past 10 years have \ndriven significant improvements in natural resource \nmanagement. It is likely that technology and its \nadoption will continue to play an important role in \nfuture improvements for the industry across all \ncomponents of environmental management. Some \nfarms are using the full extent of data availability and \ndigital technology to sustainably manage their \nnatural resource. \nOne family farm is striving for excellence through the use of digital solutions for effective management of \ntheir farm and natural capital. In the native and remnant vegetated areas of the farm, biodiversity surveys \nhave been undertaken for the past 10 years, including records of both flora and fauna. The farmers feel that \nthey have to be good stewards of the land they manage, and maintain or improve the natural resource \npresent. The native vegetation is managed as a carbon store for the farm to offset their energy use.\nCarbon farming is in the early stages of adoption across Australian farms, despite the high level of interest. \nFrom this example farm, the carbon farming markets to trade and profit from carbon capture and storage are \nnot used, rather they keep clear records of their own emissions and carbon storage to ensure they are \nmaintaining balance within their own farming system. The farm uses this data to manage the land and \nnatural resources to maintain carbon neutrality as a minimum.\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 54\n \n5.6 Energy, emissions and climate \n5.6.1 Industry priorities and key initiatives \nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns. While shifts are natural, the main \ndriver since the industrial revolution has been human activities, namely the consumption of fossil fuels but also the \nclearing of land for industry and agriculture. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases (GHGs) which include \n(amongst others) carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour and fluorinated carbons. These GHGs trap \nheat in the atmosphere (instead of the heat escaping to space) and therefore increase the land and ocean \ntemperature. Extreme temperatures and weather systems, increased risk of droughts and floods, as well as the \nchanges in pest, weed and disease ranges are all consequences of a warming planet. \nThe CSIRO and Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) have collaboratively produced a comprehensive set of \nclimate change projections covering the whole of the Australian continent (CSIRO and BoM 2015). Climate \nprojections are organised into clusters of NRM regions with similar climate and weather. The main cotton growing \nregions of QLD and NSW fall into three of the clusters, Central Slopes, East Coast, and the Murray Basin \n(Figure 27). Across all the growing regions, future climate projections show:  \nx Higher temperatures  \nx Hotter and more frequent hot days with less frost  \nx Increased intensity of heavy rainfall events \nx Harsher fire weather climate  \nx Increased evaporation rates and reduced soil moisture  (Timbal et al. 2015; Ekstrom et al. 2015; Dowdy et \nal. 2015). \nIn the Central Slopes projections also show less winter and spring rainfall, and less rainfall in the cool season for \nthe Murray Basin (Ekstrom et al. 2015; Timbal et al. 2015). The Murray Basin is also projected to spend more time \nin drought (Timbal et al. 2015).  \nAgriculture is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions with Australian agriculture being the second \nlargest contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Panchasara et al. 2021). 30% of Australian agriculture \nemissions are from the management of soils, application of urea as fertiliser, liming, rice cultivation and burning of \nagricultural residues (Panchasara et al. 2021). There are a number of management practices that can be \nimplemented to reduce on-farm emissions including but not limited to:  \nx IPM which can decrease total pesticide use \nx Revegetation and remnant vegetation management to sequester carbon \nx Minimum / no tillage practices reduce energy consumption during land preparation \nx Weather based advisory where technology is used  to do weather forecasting and gather relevant \ninformation on climate condition to make informed management decisions about the environmental \nresource (Panchasara et al. 2021). \nIn addition to crop and land management practices, energy efficiency can be taken into account during acquisition \nof machinery, and alternative energy uses can be implemented on-farm.  \nThe ambition set by the cotton industry sustainability framework PLANET. PEOPLE. PADDOCK. is to contribute to \nthe Paris Agreement’s aim of a climate neutral world. This would mean reducing the emissions released in cotton \nproduction while sustaining carbon in the soil and vegetation on cotton farms. A GHG emissions target has not yet \nbeen developed by the SWG. The industry’s strategies to achieve reduced GHG emissions include: \n1. Improving nitrogen use efficiency  \n2. Reducing energy emissions from fuel and electricity use \n3. Increasing carbon sequestrati on and storage on farms (SWG n.d.b). \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 55\nFigure 27 NRM regions grouped into clusters for climate projections (CSIRO and BoM 2015)\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 56\n5.6.2 Energy, emissions and climate on farm\nThe Cotton Grower Survey 2021 found that 51% of growers reported they believed their regional climate patterns \nwill result in a change to their production systems over the next 10 years. Only 50% of growers believed they had \nregionally specific information and forecasting tools available to them to support any plan to change their \nproduction system that may be required. The Cotton Grower Survey 2021 found there remains one in three \ngrowers who don’t believe they will need to adapt their production systems to accommodate changing regional \nclimate patterns.\nThe on-farm assessments considered a number of criteria relating to energy use efficiency. Technological \nadvancements with on-farm machinery have supported increased efficiency in this area. Machinery purchase \ncomes standard with associated technology such as software with platforms and user interfaces which can provide \nreal-time tracking of fuel use in field and optimise distance travelled by machinery to cover a field with minimum \npasses. On-farm growers used this technology as part of their regular operations. \nOn-farm assessment found that very few farms had implemented renewable energy on-farm. Some growers had \ninstalled solar on their homes on the property and some had also installed solar to sheds. The majority of feedback \nduring the on-farm assessments found that the regional infrastructure to support broadscale adoption of \nrenewables on-farm outside of domestic use was limited. Some growers were also unsure of the industry’s \nperformance in these areas.\nFigure 28 On-farm observations related to energy, emissions and climate by region and myBMP status\nThe Cotton Grower Survey 2021 found that 29% of growers were actively assessing the carbon footprint of their \nproduction system. This was more common with larger farms. The on-farm assessment found that most growers \nwere informally assessing their practices, particularly where changing their activities would result in increased cost \nefficiency. Growers were especially interested in the prospects of carbon sequestration to offset emissions and \nopportunities for carbon farming. The consensus around this at present amongst growers was that the carbon \nfarming system is still in its infancy and is hard to navigate. While some are measuring their sequestration as a \nmeasure of their own carbon neutrality (see natural resources Case study) no growers partaking in the on-farm \nassessment were actively participating in carbon markets. The agriculture sector as a whole is becoming \nincreasingly aware of the role they can play in emissions reductions and offsets, and communications resources \nare becoming available to assist farmers in making choices for their own production systems such as AgriFutures \nAustralia publication ‘A farmers handbook to on-farm carbon management’ (Carbon Count 2022). Resources and \ndecision-making tools will help aid on-farm knowledge for growers to confidently implement changes to their \npractice.\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 57\n5.6.3 Stakeholder perceptions of energy, emissions and climate\nSimilar to biodiversity, increased focus has caused stakeholder attitudes and perceptions of energy, emissions and \nclimate to change over the past decade. Many stakeholders were unsure of what strategies were being used on-\nfarm within the cotton industry, with the majority of stakeholders who commented on performance rating it ‘poor’ or \n‘very poor’ in terms of renewable uptake, actions towards climate change and reducing GHG emissions. \nStakeholders perceived the industries performance on increasing efficiencies in energy efficiency and on-farm fuel \nefficiency overall ‘good’ to ‘very good’ where a response was provided. This sentiment was echoed by growers \nwith over 80% of growers indicating current performance in this area as ‘good’ to ‘very good’. \nFigure 29 Stakeholder questionnaire responses related to  current energy, emissions and climate practices\nIn the online grower survey undertaken for this assessment, approximately 80% of respondents perceived the \nindustry’s performance to uptake renewable energy sources as good – very good. This contrasts with the findings \nfrom the on-farm assessments, which found that very few of the farms visited had implemented renewable energy \non-farm. \nInteresting, the set of five questions relating to energy, emissions and climate change had a much higher \nproportion of 'poor' responses than the other areas. ‘Actions toward reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions’ \nreceived by far the greatest number of ‘poor’ responses from growers.\nFigure 30 Grower questionnaire responses related to current energy, emissions and climate practices \n5.6.4 Conclusions and recommendations\nThis is another area that has received increased global attention and shifts in stakeholder perceptions in the period \nsince the Third Environmental Assessment. Grower sentiment has also changed with an increasing focus on \ncarbon and emissions, even if they are not yet in a place to implement on-farm changes. Growers participating in \non-farm assessments and stakeholder consultation indicated that this is an area where they require more \ninformation to ensure they can make informed decisions. \n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 58\n \n \n \n  \nRecommendations \nx Continue cross sector work to establish indicators and targets for GHG emissions and \ncarbon storage and ensure alignment with government policies and programs on the \nestablishment of agreed methodologies.  \nx There is a need for increased extension to gr owers in the area of energy, emissions and \nclimate change. Due to the complex nature of climate change, carbon and GHG \nreporting, there is a role for industry to provide high-level information and share case \nstudies and learnings amongst industry participants, with specialist, likely private sector, \nservices required to offer growers more specific information to support on-farm decision \nmaking in regard to investment and/or market participation in this area. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 59\n \n6. Summary of recommendations \nThis section presents a summary of the recommended priorities for action based on the findings outlined in this report (i.e. ToR 4). Priorities for industry action \nhave been assigned based on the following considerations: High – recommendation is considered to require immediate or short-term (i.e. 1-2 years) action; \nMedium – the recommendation may require further research, consultation or collaborative action to progress and therefore a timeframe of 2-5 years is likely to \nbe required; and Low / Ongoing – industry already has initiatives or plans in place to progress this recommendation. Plans or initiatives require ongoing action \nand are likely to need review in 5-10 years. \nNo. Recommendation Priority for action \n1 Continue to undertake updates to the existing myBMP website to ensure all information is current and weblinks and video content are \naccessible. Regular updates to both the main website and module content should be undertaken to ensure information remains current. This \nwill become increasingly important as module content and supporting resources are updated to incorporate new research and information \napplicable to new growing areas. \nHigh \n2 Continue to increase the transparency and consistency of reporting of the number of growers both registered and certified with the myBMP \nprogram. Subject to privacy considerations, this should include the total number of growers and/or farms, and the total area and/or volume \nof cotton produced by farms with myBMP certification, both in aggregate and by region. This information should be available on the myBMP \nwebsite as well as reported in the relevant annual publications, e.g. the Better Cotton and Cotton Australia Annual Reports. \nMedium \n3 Ensure a whole-of-industry commitment to increasing the uptake of myBMP certification. This may require further research into identifying \nreal and perceived barriers to uptake. Following this, there may be a need to develop and implement a comprehensive communications and \nengagement plan that incorporates regionally specific adoption targets and actions for each of the supporting industry organisations. \nHigh \n4 Evolution and possible transformation of the myBMP program is required over time toward a performance-based tool that both adds value to \nparticipating farm businesses and provides clear outputs and data to support the implementation of the industry’s sustainability agenda. This \ncould include considering if the platform could be used to measure and monitor the stocks of natural capital at the farm scale. \nMedium \n5 The sustainability framework and reporting process should continue to move toward science-based targets, acknowledging the difficulties of \nachieving ambitious targets in a complex system. The SWG has already undertaken considerable work in this area and should be \nencouraged to continue. \nMedium \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 60\n \n6 Continue to work with the respective government agencies to include, where available, information on the status of water compliance in \nmajor cotton growing regions (e.g. number/size of breaches compared to total number of holdings) in industry sustainability reporting, as \nwas flagged in the 2020 stakeholder consultation report on the setting of industry targets and indicators for the Australian cotton industry. \nHigh \n7 Continue to support research and trial work that is underway to better understand the impacts of fish entrainment and encourage broader \nadoption by cotton growers and infrastructure operators of screening on irrigation pumps and/or other identified mitigation measures. \nLow / Ongoing \n8 Use regionally targeted approaches to increase the level of biosecurity planning to ensure sound biosecurity practices are in place on-farm. \nThere is room for improvement in this area to ensure that growers are prepared and have strategies already in place for any future \noutbreaks of new pests, weeds or diseases. \nLow / Ongoing \n9 Continue to work with the broader agricultural community to increase the understanding and awareness of off-target spraying to minimise \nthe potential for environmental impacts. \nLow / Ongoing \n10 Engage partner industries and service providers to aid improvement in on-farm storage, handling and waste practices.  High \n11 Undertake regionally targeted education and awareness campaigns to improve storage, handling and waste practices on farm. This should \nbe supported by the industry’s broader extension and myBMP programs. \nHigh \n12 The SWG should undertake a materiality assessment of waste management to consider if targets and indicators, or other explicit reporting \nof industry performance in this area is required. \nHigh \n13 Continue cross sector work to establish indicators and targets for biodiversity and soil, including continuing industry specific investigations \non nitrogen use and links to emissions. \nLow / Ongoing \n14 Increase extension efforts to assist grower understanding and awareness of how they can increase their natural capital on farm. Low / Ongoing \n15 Continue cross sector work to establish indicators and targets for GHG emissions and carbon storage and ensure alignment with \ngovernment policies and programs on the establishment of agreed methodologies. \nLow / Ongoing \n16 There is a need for increased extension to growers in the area of energy, emissions and climate change. Due to the complex nature of \nclimate change, carbon and GHG reporting, there is a role for industry to provide high-level information and share case studies and \nlearnings amongst industry participants, with specialist, likely private sector, services required to offer growers more specific information to \nsupport on-farm decision making in regard to investment and/or market participation in this area. \nLow / Ongoing \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 61\n \n \n \nAppendices \n  \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 62\n \n \n \nAppendix A  \nReference List  \n  \n  \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 63\n \nReferences \nArbour International and Gibb Environmental Sciences. 1991.

It is important to note the differences in the \napproach before attempting to compare the results directly with those received in 2012. It is also important to \nconsider that the online questionnaire was not intended to achieve a representative sample but rather to gain \ninsights to the various stakeholder perceptions that exist around the Australian cotton industry’s environmental \nmanagement and performance, as well as to inform the identification of current and emerging issues. To that end, \nan online questionnaire distributed widely to stakeholders across the many cotton growing regions as well as \nmetropolitan based interest groups provided the opportunity for a diverse range of views to be obtained.\nOverall, the 2022 survey received 53 responses. The overall perceptions did tend to be more negative than those \nobtained in the 2012 Assessment. A key observation from the survey is a significantly larger engagement and \nnegative sentiment towards cotton growing from a group of respondents from the Northern Territory. This aligns \nwith recent media and GHD’s experience consulting with stakeholders in the Northern Territory for other\nagricultural projects. An example of how this has affected the results is seen in the rating of ‘The Australian cotton \nindustry’s overall environmental performance.’ Of the 53 responses, 15 classified it as ‘very poor’. 10 of these \nresponses were from the Northern Territory (19 total responses from the NT).\nFigure C.1 Responses to “The Australian cotton industry’s overall environmental performance” by State\nFurther consultation provided additional insights to the responses received. As Northern Territory agriculture has \ntypically constituted native pastures/bushland utilised for cattle grazing, the current developments of cropping land \nis causing the clearing of land and implementation of new cropping systems. Although this requires governmental \nand section 19 approval, questions have been raised by stakeholders over the environmental effects of \nestablishing the cotton industry in the Northern Territory. As cotton is the main crop being pursued in these \ndevelopments, stakeholders consider that without the introduction of cotton, the clearing of land would not be \noccurring.\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 78\n\nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 79\n\n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 80\n \n \n \nAppendix D  \nGrower survey questions and responses \n  \n  \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 81\nD-1 Online grower questionnaire and summary of \nresponses (n=16)\nD-1-1 Description of farming business\n1.

It is noted that while the environmental assessment considered the whole of the Australian \nindustry, site visits were focused on the major growing regions of Queensland and NSW. Northern Australia was \nexcluded as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions in place at the time, while the relatively small area under \nproduction in Victoria meant that it was not practical to include visits to this area. Growers from these areas were \ninvited to participate in the online grower questionnaire. \nNorthern NSW / Southern QLD – 22nd to 25th March 2022 \nTable E.1 Northern NSW and Southern QLD participants \nmyBMP status Private (Family)/Corporate \nCertified Private \nCertified Corporate \nCertified Corporate \nNot signed up Private \nNot signed up Private \nA 6th visit was scheduled but the participant had to pull out at the last minute due to Covid. \n \nSouthern NSW – 4th to 8th April 2022 \nTable E.2 Southern NSW participants \nmyBMP status Private/Corporate \nCertified Private \nRegistered Private \nRegistered Private \nRegistered Private \nNot signed up Private \nNot signed up Private \nNot signed up Private \nNot signed up Private \n \nMacquarie, NSW – 14\nth to 16th June 2022 \nTable E.3 Macquarie participants \nmyBMP status Private/Corporate \nCertified Private \nRegistered Private \nRegistered Private \nRegistered Private \nNot signed up Private \nA 6th visit was scheduled but the participant had to pull out at the last minute due to Covid. \n \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 95\n \nCentral QLD – 20th to 23rd June 2022 \nTable E.4 Central QLD participants \nmyBMP status Private/Corporate \nCertified Private \nCertified Private \nCertified Private \nCertified Corporate \nRegistered Private \nRegistered Private \nNot signed up Private \n \nSummary of Farm Visit Outcomes \nA total of 25 of 27 scheduled farm visits were completed across the four regions selected for on-farm \nassessments. Some disruptions to the original farm visit program were experienced as a result of COVID-19 and \nseasonal conditions, in particular, ongoing wet weather impacting grower availability, however the GHD project \nteam, CRDC and participating growers were able to be flexible in their approach to ensure the completion of an \naverage 6.25 visits per region. \nEffort was made to select a sample of farms that included a representative mix of BMP status, farm size (i.e. \naverage hectares grown), and business type (i.e. corporate v family farms). Given participation in the farm visits \nwas a voluntary process, however, it was not always possible to get the preferred mix of growers at the regional \nlevel to agree to host a farm visit. That being said, the overall mix of growers was largely consistent with that \ntargeted. Of the 25 farms visited, 22 (48%) are private family farms and 3 (12%) were corporate farms. A total of 9 \n(36%) farms visited were myBMP certified, a further 8 (32%) had registered with myBMP, and 8 (32%) did not use \nmyBMP. All of the corporate farms visited were myBMP certified. \nThe farm visits allowed the Assessment Team to validate grower practices and attitudes, and proceeded in line \nwith the agreed On-Farm Assessment Plan. Growers participated in good faith, engaging openly and \nconstructively in the process, which included assessment across the following criteria: \n– Environmental management (i.e., strategies employed, myBMP or other) \n– Water management (dryland and irrigated) \n– Pest management (integrated pest management and biosecurity) \n– Genetically modified cotton (if used and how this has improved their environmental management) \n– Pesticides and other agrichemicals \n– Petrochemicals storage and handling \n– Waste management \n– Land management (including soil management) \n– Vegetation management \n– Biodiversity \n– Climate change \n– Industry drivers for change and improvement \n  \n \nGHD | Cotton Research & Development Corporation | 12553753 | Fourth Environmental Assessment of the Australian Cotton \nIndustry 96\n \nE-2 Assessment criteria \nE-2-1 Environmental Ma nagement & Reporting \n1.

A current water licence is held and the conditions are complied with, including metering and recording \n2. Irrigation scheduling tools are used to determine when and how much to irrigate \n3. Any planned new infrastructure which effects the flow of water to or from a river complies with legislation \n4. Water use requirements are understood and managed:  plant water use at different times of season \nunderstood; readily available water (RAW) estimated and understood for soil types; water use efficiency \nhas been estimated using kg/mm or bales/ML where the term water means stored water and effective \nrainfall; water requirements for crop types for the region are known and understood; water use \nbenchmarking is performed \n5. Information is used each season to make better decisions: irrigation scheduling tools are used to \ndetermine when are how much to irrigate; there is awareness of deep drainage as an issue and of the \nmeasures that can be taken to reduce its impact \n6. Water storage distribution: Any plann ed new infrastructure which effects flow of water to or from a river \ncomplies with legislation; Aware of State legislation for the capture of overland flow and rainfall runoff; \nstorages and channels (new and reconfigured) are located designed to minimise evaporation, seepage \nlosses and constructed by a qualified person; Storages are surveyed to determine accurate storage \nvolumes; regular monitoring and maintenance of storage and channels for leaks and seepage; storages \nare managed to minimise evaporation and seepage losses; losses from storages and channels have been \nmeasured \n7.

Trouillas from \nthe US who is assisting us to characterise the morphology of Eutypella spp. of cotton; and inform \nthe international scientific community of our research on two important wilt diseases of cotton in \nAustralia, Reoccurring and Verticillium. \nWhat was achieved: \nMet Prof. Zarco-Tejada, an expert on the detection of Verticillium wilt in olive using remote \nsensing. Discussed current CRDC funded project and he is open to being contacted for advice \nand to assist where possible. Met with Dr F. Trouillas and discussed our research on Eutypella \nand gained further incite on research direction. Knowledge was gained to develop a better \ninsight of disease management and disease prediction tools.  \nKey points: \n· Different expression of disease symptoms and/severity possibly due to change in the \nenvironmental conditions and development of more virulent strains was a common theme. \n· Harnessing remote sensing and imaging spectroscopy for agricultural disease management is \npossible and effective. \n· Resistance and reduced sensitivity of leaf pathogens to some fungicides is concerning \nhighlighting the importance of fungicide resistance monitoring. \n· Spore-trapping and qPCR are effective methods for detection and quantification of pathogens \nassociated with trunk cankers which enables study of seasonal abundance of pathogenic fungi \nwhich contributes to the application of management strategies. This supports our future \nresearch on Eutypella sp. \n\n \n· The knowledge of seed mycobiomes is important to prevent spread of pathogenic fungi. Could \nmetagenomics be used to understand cotton seed pathology and health with aim to improve \nseed quality. \n· Volatile organic compounds of pathogens were detected using sensor technology. Could this \nbe applied to early detection of \nFov? \nOutcomes & Impact for Industry \nOutput: \nTo attend a two-day workshop (Sat & Sun before congress starts) titled “How to combine remote \nsensing with epidemiological modelling to improve plant disease management?” \nTo attend the 12th International Congress of Plant Pathology 19 – 25 August 2023, Lyon, France. \nOutcomes: \nThere were several sessions from which scientific exchange was relevant to cotton pathology. \nKnowledge gained at the conference will strengthen research capability to characterise and \nmonitor pathogens economically important to cotton and develop disease prediction tools and \nmanagement strategies for cotton. Please see summary of learnings attached. \nOutput: \nTo meet with Diatrypaceae expert Dr Florent Trouillas from UCA, Davis, USA, who is assisting us \nwith the morphological characterization and research of novel Eutypella species causing \nreoccurring wilt in cotton. \nOutcome: \nDr Smith had the opportunity to meet face-to-face with Diatrypaceae expert Dr Florent Trouillas, \nAssociate Professor of Cooperative Extension from the University of California who is currently \nassisting Dr Smith with the morphological characterisation of novel species of Eutypella which \ncauses the newly described disease of cotton in Australia. Eutypella species have not been \nassociated with cotton disease anywhere else in the world. Dr Trouillas also described the \nDiatrypaceae fungi that causes dieback in grapevines in Australia. An outcome was the in-depth \ndiscussion of our research on Eutypella and gaining further incite on research direction. \nOutput: \nThree abstracts were submitted to the ICPP committee and accepted for poster presentation. \nThese were titled: \n1. Reoccurring wilt, a new disease of cotton in Australia caused by novel Eutypella species. \n2. Reducing disease incidence of Verticillium wilt of cotton with cropping sequences that reduce \npathogen inoculum and maintain overall soil biological health. \n3.

These are listed \nin the project outputs and pre-publication drafts are appended to this report. The \npapers form the basis of the Technical Report for this project. The abstracts for each \nmanuscript follow below: \n \n• Paper 1 \n• Willingness to pay for naturally and sustainably produced clothing: A case study \nof Australian consumers \n• Global fibre production is expected to grow to 127 million tons (Mt) per annum by \n2025. Natural fibres are expected to make up only around 27% of all fibre \nproduction by this time. Polyester is the largest segment in the market and its share \nis expected to grow. As waste, pollution, the environment, and ethical \nconsiderations gain prominence in the textile industry, consumers are increasingly \nlooking for environmentally and socially responsible practices in the products they \nbuy. This study presents findings from a willingness to pay (WTP) survey of \nAustralian consumers for a naturally and sustainably produced smart-casual t-shirt. \nResults suggest that around 57% of Australians were prepared to pay extra for t-\nshirts made from natural fibres that had sustainable and ethical certifications. Cotton \nwas the preferred fibre. Australians were willing to pay AUD43 more for a cotton t-\nshirt than a polyester one. They were also prepared to pay around AUD13 more per \nt-shirt if it had a sustainability certification i.e. minimising impact on the environment \nand applying decent work principles. The WTP for sustainability features was \ngreater than the WTP for fabric and garment features, e.g. moisture wicking and \nwrinkle-free fabric properties. In this study, dollar values were used, not to \n‘commodify’ nature, but to help decide whether having sustainability attributes is \npreferable to having other attributes, in situations where a choice must be made. \n\n  \n  2 of 4 \nValuing environmental features in this way allows decision makers to make trade-\noffs based on objective measurement of consumer preferences. \n \n• Paper 2 \n• Life Cycle Assessment and product circularity. A review with context to the \ntextile supply chain in Australia \n• Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for evaluating the environmental impacts of \nproducts, processes, and services throughout their life cycles, from resource \nextraction to disposal. Governed by ISO standards 14040 and 14044, LCA consists \nof a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) to collect data on materials, energy, water use, and \nemissions, and a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) to translate these into \nenvironmental impact scores. Key concerns include climate change, biodiversity \nloss, waste, and pollution. This paper reviews how applicable current LCA is when \napplied to measure the impact of textile production regimes that embrace the \nprinciples of circularity. Noted is that LCA approaches are currently designed \nlargely for linear production models that have defined input and output boundaries. \nThis study reviews current LCA approaches for their ability to account for the \nprinciples of the circular economy, and associated sustainability development goals \n(SDGs) with regards to textiles. The study highlights the need for expanded LCA \nboundaries and impact assessments to evaluate the environmental benefits of \ncircularity effectively. This shift will require comprehensive additions to inventories \nand assessments, to address fibre production, consumption behaviours, and textile \nprocessing in a circular economy context. A review of sustainability reports from \nleading clothing brands in Australia reveals gaps in the reporting of sustainability \nand circularity endeavours. \n \n• Paper 3 \n• Evaluation of potential circularity strategies for an Australian grown cotton t-shirt \nvia Life Cycle Assessment   \n• This paper investigates the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate \ncircularity strategies for an Australian-grown cotton t-shirt. Growing issues \nassociated with textile waste have highlighted the challenges of the current linear \nproduction, consumption and disposal life cycle. This study explores how natural \nfibres such as cotton can respond to these challenges. A typical garment \nproduction and use life cycle in Australia was chosen. This case is a cotton t-shirt, \nmanufactured from cotton cultivated in northwestern New South Wales, exported to \nVietnam for manufacture, and returned to Australia for distribution, sale, use and \ndisposal. Various LCA and circularity scenarios are explored, including improved \nprocess efficiency, extended garment lifespan, recycling, and end-of-life waste \nmanagement, including reuse. Results indicate consumer behaviour, particularly the \nuse phase has the most significant impact on environmental outcomes. As \nexpected, increasing the life span reduces the production impacts and rate of waste \ngeneration. If coupled with efficiencies for washing and options for recycling, then \nthe environmental impact of an Australian cotton t-shirt can be substantially \nreduced. Noted is that consumer behaviour and use patterns relied heavily upon \nstandardised assumptions in the LCA to evaluate product performance. There is an \nopportunity to adjust these assumptions to better align with the specific context and \ncharacteristics of the fibre and operative regions. This could also help identify \npossibilities for developing recycling and reuse options for natural fibres like cotton.     \n \n \n \n \n  \n  3 of 4 \n \n \nSummary for public release \nExecutive Summary This project investigated the interplay between consumer \nmotivations, fibre sustainability, and the environmental impact of \ntextiles, with a focus on Australian cotton and competing fibres, \nincluding emerging sustainable and recycled options. The study \naddresses the growing consumer demand for transparency and \nethical practices while highlighting the limitations of current tools like \nlife-cycle analyses (LCA) and the Higg Material Sustainability Index \n(MSI) when applied to new and legacy fibres. Challenges such as a \nscarcity of data related to textile processing, consumer wear and \nwashing behaviours and end-of-life disposal, uncertainties in impact \nassessment, and the lack of industry standards underscore the need \nfor more robust methodologies. Through scenario analysis, the \nresearch has evaluated fibre production, processing, and end-of-life \npractices, emphasizing the potential for circularity. A formal choice \nexperiment (CE) survey linking technical assessments with market \npreferences was conducted to further assess consumer’s willingness \nto pay for sustainability attributes. \nThree peer review papers have been written. The first describes \nresearch that underscores the importance of sustainability in \nconsumer decisions and the textile industry. A willingness to pay \n(WTP) study revealed a majority (>60%) of Australian consumers were \nwilling to pay a premium for cotton t-shirts with sustainable \ncertifications, highlighting the economic value of environmental and \nethical features. A research paper has also critiqued existing LCA \nframeworks for their inadequacy in assessing circular textile systems, \nadvocating for expanded methodologies to address circular economy \nprinciples. And a third paper applied LCA to Australian cotton, \nexploring circularity strategies like recycling and extended garment \nlifespan while identifying consumer behaviour during the use phase \nas a critical determinant of environmental outcomes. Collectively, the \nfindings advance knowledge on fibre sustainability, bridging technical \ninsights and consumer behaviour to support a transition towards \nmore transparent, circular, and responsible textile practices. \nObjectives • Review Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) for cotton and competing \nfibres, covering all stages from production to end-of-life. \n• Review the production, processing, and distribution systems of \nboth established and emerging fibres to identify sustainability \nattributes and differences. \n• Examine the historical trends, policies, legislation, and trade \nbarriers impacting global fibre production and consumption. \n• Assess consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for sustainability \ncertifications and attributes through a formal Choice Experiment \n(CE) survey. \n• Publish findings in a peer-reviewed journal to provide trusted, \nscientifically validated insights into fibre sustainability and \nconsumer preferences. \nBackground  Global fibre production will exceed 120 Mt/annum by 2022 and is \nforecast to grow to 136 Mt/annum by 2025 as developing markets \nfollow the consumption patterns of western EU (23 kg/person/yr), \nAustralia (28 kg/person/yr) and the USA (38 kg/person/yr). Plant and \n  \n  4 of 4 \nbio-based fibres will make up less than 25% of all fibre production by \n2025. Polyester is the largest fibre segment in the market, and this is \nexpected to grow. New bio-based fibres are often marketed as \nsustainable and defer to a range of stories and indices to verify their \nworth to consumers. Worth here is defined as the fibre, or resulting \ntextile or garment, having a social and/or environmental license. \nHowever, there are questions about how well indices such as the \nHigg MSI and some Life Cycle Analyses (LCAs) properly reflect facts \nabout the production, processing and supply chains of these ‘new’ \nfibres, and the old, big fibres like cotton. Of note is that the service \nsector providing these verifications utilise indices and LCAs that are \nthemselves commercial products. Many are behind paywalls and \nprovide no transparency to the methodologies and standards used, \nor the independence and robustness of the underlying data, even \nthough a LCA’s outcome is entirely dependent on these variables. \nResearch activities The project undertook a comprehensive evaluation of cotton’s \nenvironmental performance through examination of published Life \nCycle Assessments (LCAs) for cotton and its competing fibres. The \nevaluation included a detailed review of production, processing, and \ndistribution systems, leveraging a wide range of information sources, \nincluding peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and industry \nexpertise. Additionally, the project explored the emerging fibre \nmarket by assessing the production systems of new fibres and \nidentifying their sustainability attributes relative to established fibres. \nA formal Choice Experiment (CE) survey was conducted to quantify \nconsumer willingness to pay (WTP) for sustainability certifications and \nattributes in textiles, providing valuable insights into market dynamics \nand consumer preferences. The results, integrating technical \nassessments and consumer behaviour analysis, have been prepared \nfor dissemination through three peer-reviewed publications. \nOutputs See above and below. \nImpacts  The project has provided the CRDC with valuable insights into the \nenvironmental performance and market potential of cotton compared \nto competing fibres. By highlighting the sustainability advantages of \nAustralian cotton and identifying areas for improvement through \ncircularity strategies, the research supports more informed decision-\nmaking and policy development. The findings on consumer \nwillingness to pay for sustainable and ethically certified cotton \nproducts underscore opportunities for growers to enhance market \ncompetitiveness and profitability. Additionally, the project’s critiques \nof existing sustainability assessment frameworks pave the way for \nmore accurate evaluations, ensuring that Australian cotton remains at \nthe forefront of global sustainability efforts in textiles. These \ncontributions bolster the industry's reputation and value while \naligning with the broader public interest in environmental \nresponsibility and economic efficiency. \n \nKey publications As listed above.", "meta": {"filename": "3dae7126c5f3_CSIRO%2010628%20Final%20Tech%20Report%20and%20Executive%20summary%20%282%29.pdf", "path": "data/raw/3dae7126c5f3_CSIRO%2010628%20Final%20Tech%20Report%20and%20Executive%20summary%20%282%29.pdf", "size_bytes": "106350", "mtime": "2025-08-22T17:04:28.530534", "source_url": "https://www.insidecotton.com/sites/default/files/article-files/CSIRO%2010628%20Final%20Tech%20Report%20and%20Executive%20summary%20%282%29.pdf", "source_page": "https://www.insidecotton.com/categories/2024-final-reports", "title": "Innovation fibres, their economic viability, sustainability, threats and opportunities – with specific reference to cottonG., Gordon, Stuart (Cotton Research & Development Corporation (CRDC), CSIRO, 2024-11-30)This project investigated the interplay between consumer motivations, fibre sustainability, and the environmental impact of textiles, with a focus on Australian cotton and competing fibres, including emerging sustaina", "year": "2024"}}

With this comes \na range of benefits including increasing infiltration and storage of rainfall and \nincreasing water use efficiency to grow more crop per drop. This will increase \nprofitability of farmers, particularly in moisture limited environments. The system is not \nwithout its challenges, but these can be overcome with managem ent techniques and \nagronomic advice. More research must be done to quantify the benefits as well as an \neconomic analysis to provide clear economic benefits. \nThe strip and disc system is compatible with sprinkler and drip irrigated cotton, as well \nas dryland cotton production by increasing moisture storage and water use efficiency \nand profitability, but not with conventional furrow irrigation due to the tillage \nrequirements of the system. \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n4 \nTable of Contents \nExecutive Summary ................................................................................................... 3\t\nList of Figures ................................................................

We also have a grazing operation focused on breeding and finishing sheep and cattle. We are based near Trangie, and central west, NSW, Australia.   In 2016 we demonstrated a Shelbourne XCV42 stripper header in 5 tonne/hectare (t/ha) wheat through our Shelbourne dealer Hutcheon and Pearce. We were pleased by the stripper concept, the long straw and the benefits, but could not reduce large loss ( ~ 250 kgs/ha or 5%) from the combine harvester, without having made any modifications to the combine rotor. This was in the middle of a well above average winter crop harvest with weather pressure looming time was scarce. Many changes to concave modules, and adjustments with rotor speed and concave clearance, fan and sieve settings without any significant change. With the pressure of harvest, the decision was made to revert to the draper header and continue harvest after a full day of trialing the Shelbourne stripper header. From 2017-2020 the eastern side of Australia suffered from severe drought. The vast majority of crop residue ground cover was lost, considerably worse in paddocks grazed by livestock. Many areas suffered moderate to severe wind erosion. These conditions hindered infiltration of the limited rainfall received during this period, and indeed when the drought broke in March 2020. During the drought, stripper straw would have significantly reduced the effects of wind erosion protecting soil and would have increased the infiltration of the little rainfall received. It was the drought that encouraged me to apply for a Nuffield Scholarship to research and adopt the strip and disc farming system. I was accepted as a scholar in 2020 but our travel was postponed for two years due to Covid19. This hindered travel but did not stop us researching and implementing the strip and disc system whereby Quigley Farms purchased two stripper fronts for use in the harvest of 2020. Our strip and disc farming system was fully adopted across the farm and we have not looked back.  Some experiences in this report are based off our own learnings from adopting the strip and disc farming technique across both rain grown dryland, and irrigated farming systems, although personal study time was completed on a Global Focus Program and individual study in the USA in 2022/23, as details in Table 1.

This included research systems and practices involved in achieving this, with topics of interest including: • stripper headers (fronts) • seeding practices that manage to plant through high residue loads • combine set up to allow for stripper header use with acceptable grain loss • fallow efficiency • soil health • crop competition and the mulch effect • soil temperature and frost • nutrient tie up • disease inoculum from previous year’s crop residue • herbicide and fungicide options and applications • how high residue systems coexist with irrigated and dryland cotton production • cover crops • weeds \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n12  \nChapter 1: Introduction  Dryland crop production systems in the arable zones of Australia are commonly production limited by climatic factors including moisture availability, incidence of frost events at flowering, and high temperatures or moisture stress during grain fill (Barlow et al. 2015). Low moisture availability and heat stress are particularly common in New South Wales (NSW). Over the years, new agronomic management practices and technology have been developed and widely utilised to reduce the effect of these climatic factors, allowing growers to achieve remarkable yield increases and efficient utilisation of inputs (Turner & Asseng 2005). One major strategy to combat moisture availability has been to store rainfall in the fallow period (the period between the harvest of one crop and the planting of another) for utilisation in the following crop, increasing the Plant Available Water (PAW) to that crop from stored soil moisture. Protecting fallow moisture has been a long-time focus of grain crop production, but over the last 20 years has moved from predominantly tillage practices to the chemical control of weeds, resulting in the zero till or minimum tillage adoption of modern Australian grain growers.  The ‘no till’ movement has been driven by technology gains increasing the ease and efficiency of chemical applications, including Global Positioning Systems (GPS) autosteer and automatic rate controllers. In recent years, this has been further enhanced by section control, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and optical sprayers. These spraying advances have been coupled with Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) and inter-row or on-row seeding, to give modern grain production in Australia. Modern Australian grain farming practices have advanced through research, development and uptake of technology, agronomic management and varieties, on results-based performance. As Australian grain farmers are efficient and world leading in their management and operations, all gains in productivity and cost savings going forward will be minimal, as these are the 1% gains that cumulatively make a significant difference. This will be the case until new disruptive technologies are developed and implemented.  The no-till movement has been a significant yield enhancer for grain producers and is now widely adopted across the industry increasing fallow moisture, reducing erosion, increasing water use efficiency (WUE), and most importantly, increasing yields.  However, agronomic opportunities still exist to capture and store more water, reduce evaporation, and use PAW more effectively. Kirkeggard and Hunt (2010) in their work listed residue management, crop sequencing, and weed control to name a few.  Residue management to increase fallow efficiency is a key focus of this report and this research, focusing on stripper headers harvesting cereals and the opportunities and challenges provided by the implementation of these practices.   \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n13  \nChapter 2: The strip and disc system  2.1 Stripper header (stripper fronts)   A stripper header is a type of combine harvester attachment (front) used to harvest cereal crops such as wheat and barley, oats and rice. A stripper header is designed to strip the grain from the plant stem, leaving most of the plant material remaining standing in the field. Stripper headers consist of a rotating drum or rotor with rows (8) of stripping fingers. The drums containing the rows of fingers rotate at high speed (400-700 RPM) and strip the grains from the stem as the stripper header passes though the crop. The stripped grain and some crop residues are then thrown up against the hood towards the rear of the header where they are transported towards the harvester feeder-house via a table auger, and into the harvester. A large proportion of the crop is threshed by the action of the stripper header passing through the crop, resulting in the harvester becoming largely a separating unit, separating threshed grain from the crop residue. The stripping process significantly reduces the amount of material that passes through the harvester as most of the plant material remains behind in the field. This offers significant advantages of reducing engine load, horsepower usage and fuel burn, increasing harvesting efficiency compared to traditional harvesting methods of a draper or table auger header (front).  Shelbourne Reynolds is currently the most common stripper platform on the market (2023). They have been manufacturing stripper headers since 1989. Since 2012, they haveproduced an xcv42 model that is 42 foot wide. This particularly suits the popular 12-meter CTF swath width widely adopted by Australian farmers. Two manufactures have also started to produce stripper headers, Applequist Manufacturing in Kansas (USA), and Khart Industries in Saskatoon, Canada.  2.2 Conventional harvesting and residue spreading Traditional methods of cereal harvesting cut half the plant off and feed it through the harvester to then thresh and separate the grain from the plant material, predominately using crop on crop threshing techniques in rotary combines. The combine then attempts to spread the cut plant material back across the swath width, which is often not achieved satisfactorily. An even spread of residue across the full swath width is crucial but is rarely achieved with factory residue spreaders. This is exacerbated by the adoption of large 12 metre swaths, and not possible at this point with larger 18 metre swath widths without aftermarket belt extensions to more residue spreaders further out from the combine, or specialty aftermarket choppers. If residue is not spread the full cut width, issues arise from the uneven distribution of crop residue including: - plugging of seeders at seeding - different moisture levels across the swath at seeding, making uniform broadacre seeding difficult, and - uneven distribution of nutrients across the swath width Residue spreading was one of the contributing factors in choosing to adopt the stripper disc system. The windrow of thick straw/chaff that landed one metre inside the extremities of the 12 metre cut width often gave us issues at seeding and poor establishment as illustrated in Figure 2.  \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n14  \nWheat straw by weight comprises 0.76% nitrogen, 0.05% phosphorus, 1.14% potassium (Pulske et al. 2018). If the harvester cut the straw at 50% of its height during the harvest process and didn’t spread it to the edges of the cut width and the straw fraction was 5t/ha this would mean a removal of 2.5t/ha of crop residue including 19 units (kgs) of nitrogen, 1.5 units (kgs) of phosphorus, and 28.5 units (kgs) of potassium. The difference would be greater than this as the remainder of the cut will have more than its original biomass increasing its nutrient loading. If this happens consecutively over several years on GPS CTF tramlines, then it could lead to serious nutrition inequality across the swath and the field.  In the case of a legume like faba beans that can fix upwards of 200 units (kgs) of nitrogen per hectare (ha) in a growing season and are often selected as a crop choice due to their nitrogen fixing ability. If this crop residue is not spread evenly then so too are the nutrients across the swath. Uneven distribution of plant residue by factory residue spreaders (from 50-200%) also provides differences in soil moisture levels across the swath width, and thick thatches of chaff that incur challenges at seeding and plant establishment. This creates challenges at seeding with some row units being too wet and some too dry compromising seeding performance, as well as providing trash flow issues and ‘hair pinning’ (when a disc cannot cut through heavy layers of chaff resulting in poor soil seed contact). \n Figure 1 Poor spread pattern of factory residue spreaders, showing the uneven distribution of plant material across the swath width. (Source: Rhylie Botheras) 2.3 Disc seeders  Single disc seeders are minimum tillage seed drills that utilise a sharp disc running on an angle of approximately 5-7o to cut a slot in the soil, place the seed and close the slot. They are often required for paddocks with high residue loads due to the sharp disc that cuts through the soil also cuts through the crop residue, allowing for good seed soil contact. Where straw is long and whole this process occurs easily. However, if a harvester has not distributed crop residue evenly across the full cut width, the \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n15  \nthicker layers of straw of chaff cause hair pinning of the residue around the disc and prevents good seed soil contact and seed germination, as shown in Figure 2. \n Figure 2 Poor spread pattern of factory residue spreaders with uneven distribution of plant material across the swath width, and subsequent poor crop establishment (Source: Author) The rolling nature of disc seeders allows for long residue to pass through the machine without catching on static components. This is a huge advantage in seeding crops into high residue environments. In contrast, the static nature of a tyne seeder makes seeding into high residue fields very challenging and often results in burning stubbles. The tynes can act as rakes raking residue into piles and plugging the seeder, preventing it from doing its job. Residue handling on tyne machines can be aided by the addition of disc coulters, which run engaged in the soil just in front of the individual tyne unit and aim to cut the longer pieces of residue to make them shorter to allow the \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n16  \nresidue to pass through the machine and avoid residue raking. Tyne seeders often require high residue loads to be mulched, slashed or mown into smaller pieces in order to handle them at seeding (Figure 3).  \n Figure 3 Slashed (or mown) wheat straw for trash flow purposes (Source: Author) This is often the case with cereal and canola stubble. The use of a disc seeder will not guarantee getting through extremely large stubble loads, however, will significantly help.  Double disc planters are also an effective planting tool in large residue loadings, as shown in Figure 4. Double disc planters work in a similar context to single disc planters but have two opposing discs each running at a 5-7o angle, each with a gauge wheel to set seed depth. Traditional row crop precision planters are double disc machines. Double disc planters are usually more prone to hair pinning because of the larger surface area provided by two sets of blades touching. However, this can be minimised if discs are offset, slightly different sizes or one is scalloped or fluted allowing the discs to travel at different speeds or angles creating a more distinct cutting edge to cut trash. The most common disc seeders utilised in strip and disc systems in Australia seem to be the single disc units, in particular the John Deere 1890 Single Disc, NDF disc planters, Excel, Serafin and Boss row units to name a few.   \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n17  \n Figure 4: A double disc planter successfully inter-row planting through a large, stripped stubble load (Source: Author) \n Figure 5: Canola sown into two consecutive years of wheat stripper straw at 2kgs/ha with a NDF single disc planter that established 20-30 plants/m2 to grow 3.3t/ha of canola, highlighting the high trash flow capabilities of single disc planters when using inter-row planting with a high degree of accuracy (Source: Author) \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n18  \nChapter 3: Benefits of the striper header 3.0 Harvester efficiency  Due to the nature of stripper headers only the grain, husk and leaf material are stripped for processing by the harvester. Thus, stripper headers have been shown to increase throughput efficiency by between 30% and 50%, and even 100% in some cases. Every grower visited in Australia and across the world has attested to an increase in harvester capacity and efficiency, and there is more to be done in this space to increase capacity whilst maintaining and reducing losses.  The capital purchase of a stripper provides a very cost-effective increase in harvester capacity, especially when compared to another harvester. Many growers also stated that the increase in harvest efficiency and reduced engine loading has allowed them to reduce one combine class size, often resulting in an AUD $50,000-$100,000 capital saving by adopting a stripper header. Growers also noted the reduced wear, repair, and maintenance on machines due to only processing the grain and chaff fractions of the plant, and not having to feed the remainder of plant material through the machine. Harvester efficiency was also observed by the ability of the strippers to start harvest earlier when straw was still partly green and allowed the stripper headers to harvest much later into the night or ‘24 hours’ because they did not have to process damp straw that would stop conventional draper headers from harvesting. This creates a huge amount of value in situations of weather pressure, by providing more operating hours in the day (in some cases, up to 40% more).  Large gains in fuel efficiency have also been gained from not having to process the straw fraction in the harvester. Engine loads often did not exceed 65-70% and result in burning considerably less fuel (50% in most growers’ experience), combined with increased harvesting speeds further reducing cost per hectare and per tonne harvested. The fuel saving over 200 separator hours of harvest would be considerable towards repaying some of the initial capital cost of the stripper header (particularly with current diesel prices over AUD $2 per litre, 2023).  A correct harvester setup with a stripper header typically sees 0.5-2% loss, half of that from the stripper header itself and half from the harvester, which is viewed by the industry as an acceptable loss. There is room to improve this and will be a key focus of growers in the future. Factors affecting stripper header loss include row spacing, crop density, yield, hood height, finger orientation, and combine forward speed.  Correct combine harvester setup for the use of a stripper front often requires significant modification but depends on the combine harvester type. The Shelbourne Reynolds app and website provide modification and setting recommendations. In the author’s experience, these have been a good starting place but still require more fine tuning and further research to get full efficiency and minimal losses.  Experience with stripper headers has predominately focused on Case IH Flagship Combines, as shown in Figure 6, which require the implementation of 12 straight separator bars, spiked rasp bars in the rear of the combine, hard thresh in concave Module 1, followed by round bar concaves in Positions 2, 3 and 4. Additionally, the rotor veins are in the slowest position and included 10o threshing elements over the front half of the rotor. This setup is largely courtesy of Daniel Fox of Marrar, NSW.  \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n19  \n Figure 6 Modifications to a Case IH Flagship rotor threshing elements, including straight separator bars and 10° rasp bars (Source: Author) \n Figure 7 Case IH Flagship Combine LHS rotor with hard thresh helical concave in Position 1, and round bar concaves in Position 2, 3 and 4, with paint removed from grain separation in Position 2 round bar concave after only one season (Source: Author)  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n20  \nThe stripper header relies on a wall of crop material and the hood to create a shield against the stripping rotor to prevent the stripped grains from exiting out the front of the stripping rotor and onto the ground. Thin plant stands, wide rows (over 350mm) and poor yielding crops are subject to higher losses. Increasing ground speed and decreased hood clearance have been shown to reduce stripper header loss (Wilkins et al. 1996) which is great for increasing productivity. Reduced ability to thresh grain is an issue with stripper headers in hard to thresh wheat varieties. Typically, rotary harvesters with conventional headers rely on crop on crop rubbing action to thresh the grain from the ear. In the case of a stripper header, there is not a crop-on-crop action due to the lack of straw in the rotor. The system relies on most of the grain being threshed by the stripper header and the combine acting largely as a separator. This has resulted in phasing out hard to thresh varieties like Spitfire and replacing them with easier varieties to thresh. This is not without risk though as often easier threshing varieties are more prone to pre harvest losses. Shelbourne Stripper headers in Australia mostly come with ‘cups down’, meaning that the stripping rows themselves are facing downwards, leaving a more aggressive leading edge facing away from the crop. This is the least aggressive setting. In most places visited in the world (in particular, Colorado and Kansas, USA), many growers run their ‘cups up’ in the most aggressive position, which may aid in harvesting hard to thresh varieties, or cups up/cups down on alternate rows of stripping fingers.   3.1 Fallow efficiency  Fallow efficiency is used to describe the amount of moisture as a percentage or proportion that has fallen in the fallow period and stored in the soil that becomes PAW, contributing to plant growth or yield (Verburg and Which, 2016). In Australia, the term fallow refers to the period between subsequent crops (6-12 months), whereas the term long fallow refers to the skipping of a crop in the crop sequence to store more moisture for the proceeding crop or for other agronomic reasons such as weed or disease control. There are a lot of complex factors involved in the simple equation of fallow efficiency including soil type, compaction, topography, crop residue, rain intensity, rain days, temperature, timing of rainfall, and weed control. The fallow efficiency of modern Australian grain farmers is typically somewhere in the order of 25% of rainfall that falls over the fallow period that can be utilised by the following crop.  Australia’s climate is extremely variable. This is even more so in the dryland farming region of central west NSW. The region receives between 400mm and 600mm of rainfall on average per year depending on location, but this can vary from >150mm to < 1,100mm. The average evaporation of this region is over 2,000mm, as shown in Figure 9 and 10. Therefore, moisture is most often the limiting factor to rain-grown cash crop production, and whatever can be done to store more moisture and turn it into PAW and production must be done where feasible to maximise yield, profitability and sustainability. The cropping regions of NSW and southern QLD typically receive significant rainfall (in the order of 60%) in the summer fallow period. These rainfall events need to be stored as efficiently as possible to be put towards the next crop. Winter crops are \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n21  \npredominant in these regions due to the much slower evaporation rate during the winter months.  \n Figure 8 Graph illustrating seasonal averages of Trangie, NSW (source: Weather Zone, ??) \n Figure 9 Bureau of Meteorology average pan evaporation annual rates for Australia. We farm approximately where the red dot is located (source: Bureau of Meteorology,??)  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n22  \nUnkovich (2006) investigated the contribution of fallow moisture towards wheat yield over several years in several regions. In central west NSW, they found that summer fallow rainfall contributed up to 2t/ha (or 72% of mean) simulated wheat yield. Highlighting the importance and effectiveness of stored fallow moisture, and not surprising when looking at the average climate in Trangie, in central west NSW, where the author farms. Figures 8 and 9 highlight winter months being the lowest rainfall received on average. According to Zeleke et al, (2014), the effects of stubble on fallow efficiency showed that as stubble loads increased in fallow fields so too did moisture content and PAW. Their work indicated that a 6t/ha stubble rate can increase the end of fallow period soil moisture by up to 60%. Similar themes have been observed in Texas, USA, where a 4t/ha wheat stubble was compared to a bare fallow. Unsurprisingly there the wheat residue caught nearly 50mm more moisture than the bare fallow (Unger, 1978). As mentioned above, residue management and ground cover play a large role in fallow efficiency. At the harvest of a cereal crop, there is the same amount of residue if it is harvested conventionally with a draper front or a stripper header. The difference lies in the additional time it takes for the stripper header residue to break down as it has not been broken up into small pieces and distributed onto the ground. The cumulative effect over several years is where the stripper front will accumulate more crop residue. And more crop residue will store more moisture and more moisture will grow more crop, and the cycle will continue.  According to Henry et al. (2008), “the use of a stripper header harvesting cereal grains leaves significantly more standing crop residues that will be retained longer than residues following harvested conventionally with a draper header”. The result is more protection of the soil from wind erosion and greater precipitation storage efficiency during fallow periods. The other thing to note is that draper harvested cereal residue can be subject to relocation via high wind speeds, reducing the amount of residue and moisture storing ability.  3.1.1 Capture and storage of rainfall Maximising crop residue in dryland farming systems has a large positive effect on the  capture and storage of rainfall moisture. Heavy rainfall and large droplets can cause damage to the soil surface blocking pores and infiltration routes and causing surface sealing. The crop residue softens the rain drop impact to the ground leaving soil pores open and undisturbed to allow for high infiltration rates to be maintained and reduced runoff (Hunt, 2011). Crop residue also increases the friction coefficient of water that is in the process of running off. Consequently, slowing water movement down allows maximum time for infiltration into the soil to occur and increases stored soil moisture and PAW. This is even more critical in undulating topography.  Heavy stubble loads (5.4t/ha) have been shown to increase infiltration by 1.8 times when compared to light stubble loads (0.8t/ha) in Temora, NSW (Hunt, 2011), and more than doubled the amount of rainfall required to produce surface ponding or run off. Zero tillage and stubble retention have also been shown to increase infiltration rates of sandy clay loams and grey cracking clays in southeastern Australia from two to 8 times respectively (Bissett and Oleary, 1996). Freebairn and Wockner in their work in 1986, showed they could reduce run off by 35% with zero tillage management in Queensland. \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n23  \nDecreased runoff as a result of surface residue has been attributed to reduced soil crust formation and slowed flow rate across the surface due to greater water flow path disturbance, and greater resistance to flow (Steiner, 1994). Increased residues are responsible for decreased runoff, decreased evaporation, and increased infiltration, resulting in greater precipitation storage efficiency (Unger, 1978). Not surprisingly, moisture storage was also a key factor in the utilisation of stripper headers around the world. This was the case in the USA, in particular in Kansas, Colorado, Texas and Wyoming, as well as Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada, to name a few. Not only was this for the same reasons strippers are utilised in Australia to store moisture (as mentioned above), but also to catch snow and prevent it blowing away in their winters. This is an extremely effective way of retaining snow, for it to melt in the spring and increase PAW, as shown in Figure 10. \n Figure 10 Conventional draper cut straw on the left-hand side, and stripper straw on the right-hand side in Canada, highlighting the importance of snow catch to crop yields (source: K Hart). The Kalcevic family, and the Poss family, both in Colorado, USA had adopted the stripper harvesting system in an extremely dry climate of 12 inches, or 305mm. They both found that the stripper harvesting system allowed them to catch more snow and increase their fallow efficiency enough to grow profitable crops in a very arid environment by keeping more residue on the soil surface.  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n24  \n Figure 11 Visting the Kalcevic family farm on the first day of the 2023 wheat harvest with stripper headers, Bennett, Colorado, USA, 17 June 2023,  with Billy Browning, the author, and Kent Kalcevic (Source: Author) The Kalcevics’ believed that land in their region was marginal for growing crops due to their arid but high elevation environment. However the stripper headers and zero tillage are allowing them to conserve more moisture and grow profitable crops across a large scale farm near Bennett Colorado. They had downsized a combine class and increased wheat yields with the adoption of stripper headers.  3.1.2 Stripper residue microclimate  Air will dry the soil considerably more than plant roots. This varies between soil types, in sandy clay loams this is 12mm+ and heavy clays up to 42mm due to their cracking nature and increased exposure to air (Verburg and Which, 2016). Standing residue is more effective at decreasing wind speed near the soil surface. The standing residue absorbs more of the wind’s energy, raises the zero-velocity point above the soil and can produce a microclimate at the surface. Standing stripper stubble also vastly reduces wind speed and air movement at the soil surface.  Air is a key component in evaporation as it is the vehicle that removes moist air from close to the soil surface. When the air becomes saturated with moisture it will stop drawing moisture away from the soil. If the moist air is moved away from the soil surface (wind or air movement) it is replaced by drier air that has greater osmotic potential to remove more moisture from the soil or plants. Wind is a major driver in evapotranspiration rates, and so will protect seedlings until they grow out of the canopy layer (Verburg and Which, 2016). This concept cumulatively reduces evaporation over \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n25  \nthe fallow, increases fallow efficiency, and provides moisture more efficiently for use in subsequent crops.  This concept is seen in conventionally harvested cereal crops, but to a lesser extent as stubble height is considerably shorter (30cm vs 90cm).   \n Figure 12 Conventional draper cut straw on the left-hand side, with stripper straw on the right-hand side, Canada (Source: K Hart) Cereal harvesting methods can greatly influence residue amount and orientation, and subsequently soil water evaporation during the fallow period. McMaster et al. (2000), showed that soil water evaporation could be reduced by 20 to 50% as wheat harvest cutting height increased from 10cm to 50cm. A conclusion could be derived from these results that stripper straw should perform better again at reducing evaporation. However, it should be noted, that stubble will not prevent all evaporation, it will just slow the rate of evaporation down. The more stubble, the greater the reduced rate of evaporation. Increased fallow efficiency comes from the soil surface taking much longer to dry out, allowing subsequent rain events to build on previous rain events to pulse deeper into the soil profile away from the evaporative zone in the soil (0-20cm). As evaporation rates change throughout the seasons, so too does the effectiveness of cover in storing moisture, significantly increasing in autumn, winter and spring, and reducing in summer months as a rule of thumb. \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n26  \n Figure 13 Rainfall events (vertical blue bars) cause pulses of soil water that last for different amounts of time in the presence (black lines) or absence (grey lines) of stubble (Source: Verburg & Which, 2016) Figure 13 has been adapted by Verburg and Which and does not account for stripper stubble. When rainfall events overlap, more water infiltrates beyond the evaporation zone in the presence of stubble cover, and this will increase fallow efficiency. The level of stubble cover will directly impact this equation (Verburg and Which, 2016). Another benefit of standing residue and slowing wind speed at the surface is that it will significantly reduce wind erosion, preventing much of the normal avalanching of soil material downwind (Woodruff et al., 1972 and Van de Ven et al., 1989). Wind erosion is a significant issue in Australia, particularly in droughts or dry times. Smika (1983), measured a 74% reduction in wind speed at the soil surface when standing wheat residue height was increased from 30 to 60 cm. Consequently, there may be significant differences in soil erosion depending on residue amount, type, quality, and orientation. This will be particularly important in droughts where planting rains are not received and ‘forced fallows’ occur.  3.1.3 Mulch effect The stripper disc system can lead to large quantities of residue accumulating over several seasons. This provides a physical layer that prohibits weeds from germinating successfully, reducing weed seed populations and reducing weed numbers. This theory of crop competition and the mulch layer was mentioned at the Weedsmart Conference in Dubbo, NSW as ‘one of the big six’ modes of weed control (Condon, pers. comm., 2023). The straw in the inter-row also increases crop competition via shading and mulching mechanisms. This is a very effective way of combating weeds with a non-chemical option that is also extremely cost effective at basically no cost. An important consideration moving forward with growers’ environmental stewardship. The increased availability of moisture to weeds that do germinate provide better conditions for weed growth and subsequently easier to kill weeds that are actively growing and subject to less stress.  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n27  \n Figure 14  The mulch effect on crop residue at Poss Farms, Hugo, Colorado, USA, July 2023 (Source: Author)  3.1.4 Soil temperature Increased levels of crop residue provide a layer of insulation for the soil. The remaining residue acts as a protective layer against direct sunlight. Residue is generally light in colour consequently reflecting sunlight radiation back into the atmosphere, rather than it being absorbed by the soil surface. This offers a significant advantage to collection, storage and longevity of stored soil moisture, particularly in summer as soil temperatures have been noted to be 10oC + cooler in stripper stubble vs draper stubble, and 20oC more so over tilled or bare soil (French, Fox, and McKinlay, pers. comm., 2019).  3.2 Planting timing  Timing is crucial in any cash crop production business. Long-term research in wheat has shown that for every day after the optimum sowing window, a loss of 35kgs/ha/day can be expected, and in the author’s opinion this is a conservative figure. Sowing timeliness is important to ensure crop growth and development occurs within the correct climatic conditions to optimise yield (Ward et al, 2021). Heavy stubble loads, conserved via stripper harvesting will help retain moisture closer to the soil surface, potentially allowing for seeding to take place on time many days or months after rain, or on more marginal planting rains (Hunt, 2011). This can be the difference between getting a crop established or not, which can have colossal impacts on potential crop \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n28  \nyield and farm returns. This has been experienced by many farmers utilising the strip and disc farming system, and is one of the major benefits of the system.  \n Figure 15 Canola in stripper straw flowering earlier around the unplanted CTF wheel tracks where soil has access to sunlight warming the soil profile and accelerating plant metabolism and growth, compared to the remainder of the swath (Source: Author)  3.3 Economics of increased fallow efficiency Stored soil moisture is extremely valuable in dryland farming operations. French and Schultz in 1984 modelled the potential yield of wheat based on PAW and rainfall, in the absence of other constraints. For every extra millimetre stored and utilised in the growing season, it could be expected to grow an additional 15 kilograms of wheat per hectare. In more recent experiences with modern varieties and agronomy (nearly 40 years later) this figure is more like 20 kilograms of additional grain per millimetre per hectare.  The average rainfall of Trangie, NSW in the fallow months of December to April, could be expected to receive somewhere in the order of ~250mm. If growers can increase fallow efficiency by 10% during this period from retaining more crop residue, that equates to 25mm extra moisture available to the crop. Multiplied by 20kgs per extra millimetre stored, results in growing an extra ~500kgs grain or AUD $180/ha of margin at today’s prices (AUD $360 APW) or AUD $125/ha on an AUD $250 long term wheat prices (2023). This offers a significant increase in profitability and over scale should have a healthy return on investment in implementing the stripper headers. This estimate is conservative and fallow benefits could be greater than this.  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n29  \n3.4 Organic matter Soil Organic Matter (SOM) is a key indicator of soil health. SOM in Australian soils is typically low, particularly in the low rainfall and high evaporation regions. A fundamental component of SOM is plant growth, of which is limited in the low rainfall and high evaporation areas of Australia’s grain areas. Perennial grassland is known to have the greatest levels of SOM and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), because of their ever-growing nature and ability to utilise rainfall moisture as it falls (Rosenzweig, C & Hillel, 2018). While perennial grassland systems are the best alternative for soil health, they ignore the social and economic importance of cropland for rural communities, the economy, and feeding the world. Cropping systems that maximize diversity, cover, and time a plant is growing, while minimising disturbance, and increasing aggregate stability at the highest rate for annual planted cropland. Soil health management is most successful when all the principles are implemented (Milodragovich, 2016). SOM in the low rainfall and high evaporation regions is typically between 0 and 1%. SOM is important for soil health as it directly influences aggregate stability and biological activity, serves as a nutrient reservoir, and significantly increases soil water holding capacity. Zero-till has been a positive management strategy for increasing SOM over conventional tillage, and so too has increasing crop intensity. Zero tillage is positive as it slows the breakdown of SOM, retains soil structure and increases crop intensity (or reduces long fallow) and crop diversity as it maximises plant biomass produced per annum.  Another important factor in increasing SOM is to maintain correct soil pH and apply fertiliser to the crop or pasture. There has been research stating that correct soil pH and the use of fertiliser can have the most influential effect on improving SOM due to increases in plant growth and biomass above and below the soil surface, which consequently provides all the benefits listed above (Enwall et al., 2005).  The use of a stripper header has been referred to as a conservation harvest management technique to leave stubble length tall during the fallow period (Milodragovich, 2016). Conservation of residue will increase soil health, aggregate stability, infiltration, and water holding capacity, leading to increased crop production, increased residue accumulation, increased biological activity, and arguably most importantly improved drought resilience (Amézketa, 1999).  Stripper residue, storing more moisture and growing higher yielding crops will help to continue to improve soil organic matter and increase carbon levels. In the author’s opinion, increasing stored moisture will have a similar effect to that seen by correct soil pH and fertiliser, at growing more plant material and increasing SOM and soil organic carbon, even if these gains are marginal. “There will be a positive feedback loop as more moisture is available and aggregation increases. Soil organic matter will build, which will in turn increase water holding capacity and increase biological activity” (Milodragovich 2016) and in turn this will increase crop yields. Soil temperature is also a key driver in metabolic rate of microflora decomposing SOM. Reduction in soil temperature from the strip and disc system reduces breakdown of SOM and increases levels of SOC.   \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n30  \n3.5 Additional planting opportunities Increased crop residue driving additional moisture storage is creating more favourable planting conditions and creating opportunities to plant additional crops outside of traditional cropping regions. Scott Poss in Hugo Colorado, USA, is farming in a marginal cereal growing region that receives 300mm of rain annually. The stripper header system and zero till farming has opened up their land to grow moderately low yielding corn at low populations, which is generating good returns and giving them a large upside due to a favourable season should it occur. Corn in their region has a great freight advantage, but is not a traditional corn growing region due to their dry climate. The Poss family this year have also been able to plant winter canola in 2024, a first for them on their farm. In Queensland and NSW cropping regions I believe that the stripper straw will provide additional planting opportunities for dryland cotton and sorghum into new regions that are traditionally more marginal – particularly in forced fallow situations when planting rain for winter crops is not received. Increased stored moisture and better planting conditions will help establishment and increased residue will reduce inter-row evaporation in increase water use efficiency and crop yield.  \n Figure 16 Scott Poss, Alexandra Quigley and Billy Browning in Poss Farms, Hugo, Colorado, USA, dryland corn crop, July 2023 (Source: Author)  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n31  \n Figure 17 Moisture close to the surface under the mulch layer at Poss Farms in Hugo, Colorado, USA, indicating a viable planting opportunity was present (Source: Author)  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n32  \nChapter 4: Challenges of the strip and disc system 4.1 Soil temperature and frost The same factors that provide advantages during the summer months provide challenges during the winter months. Reduced soil temperatures reduce plant metabolic rates causing delayed early growth and development until the plant gets to a critical mass of ground coverage itself at canopy closure. At this point the plants are intercepting light before they reach the soil surface, for example, mid-late tillering in cereal crops or stem elongation in canola. Frost events are temperatures that conduce the freezing of material on or near the soil surface. Frost is a stressor of actively growing plants and reduces plant growth, vigour and development. Soil, depending on texture and colour, can provide a significant buffer to frost, especially before canopy closure is reached. Soil exposed to sunlight radiation is warmed during the day and slowly gives off its heat during the night.  Soil is at its coolest temperature early in the morning before it begins to warm again the following day. The nature and volume of soil having such a large volume means it is slow to change temperature. This is extremely valuable in the mitigation of frost for developing crop seedlings reducing the severity of the frost. Where soil is covered by plant material that reflects the sun’s radiation back into the atmosphere, the soil does not warm in the same nature as exposed soil. This lack of temperature buffering can provide large setbacks to early crop growth and development and even seedling death in moderate to severe frost events.  \n Figure 18 Canola in stripper straw recovering after a severe frost event. Also note, the yellow leaf spot inoculum on residual wheat straw (Source: Author, 2021) \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n33  \nThis concept is not only limited to winter cropping production and the effects can been seen in soil temperature sensitive summer crop options including cotton. Management techniques can reduce the effect by removing most crop residue from the row with row cleaners several weeks before planting of the summer crop occurs, allowing time for the exposed soil to warm up. This is possible due to the wider rows in summer row crop operations to allow the residue into the inter-row. GRDC (2023), published in their Stubble Initiative document, that retaining more than 2.5t/ha of stubble can increase the risk of frost damage, making the frosts colder and longer, with lower temperatures at head height. The retained stubble reduces the heat radiating from the soil at night, resulting in less warming of the crop canopy.  4.2 Herbicide and fungicide application 4.2.1 Fallow spraying and optical sprayers Zero tillage farming requires chemical control of weeds in the period between when crops are grown referred to as the fallow period. High residue loads and standing stubble physically provide a more challenging environment for herbicide applications to reach target weed species. This must be accounted for when setting up sprayers in these conditions. Nozzle set-up, spray quality and water volumes must be suitable for the types of herbicides being used and to account for somewhat reduced target efficacy. In the author’s experience, efficacy has been good to excellent and not as big of an issue as previously thought. Particularly in summer fallows where targets weed size is larger.  Optical sprayers are sprayers equipped with cameras that detect chlorophyll or have cameras that scan images for weed species to detect, then send a signal to a solenoid to open and spray the target weeds. With cameras being one metre plus apart depending on the system, it is expected that results are going to be minorly compromised when compared to conventional draper cut stubble or bare fallows, but still effective, particularly with the increased ‘crop competition’ from the stubble.   4.2.2 Pre-emergent herbicides and disc seeders As previously mentioned, disc seeders are often required in high residue farming environments to manage trash flow. Disc seeders combined with high residue loading covering the soil surface provide a challenging environment for pre-emergent herbicides to work and in some cases may not be compatible. Pre-emergent herbicides will inhibit weed seeds from growing as they germinate. They require good soil contact to properly target weed seeds on and within the soil surface. Most pre-emergent herbicides are generally designed for use with tyne seeders as they physically move treated soil out of the seed zone. Using a disc seeder immediately reduces the number of pre-emergent herbicides available for use. This is however a quickly moving space with several new herbicides available that are compatible with the strip and disc system, consult an agronomist for research in this space as it is a dynamic and complex space, and a number of other factors come into play including soil type, climatic conditions and moisture levels.  \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n34  \nPre-emergent herbicides should be applied with large droplets that shatter and reach the soil surface, combined with high water volumes to penetrate the soil layer. A focus on solubility is important for pre-emergent herbicides to wash off the stubble and onto the soil surface with rain events to alleviate the high residue loads. \n Figure 19 Two leaf sow thistle controlled in 5t/Ha + wheat stripper straw with a water rate of 48lts/ha coarse spray quality. Effective weed control is possible in heavy stripper straw. (source: author).  \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n35  \n4.3 Disease inoculum Crop residue, when intact will last considerably longer than if it has been dismembered through the harvesting process. Standing residue has minimal contact with soil resulting in it taking much longer to decompose. Consequently, old crop residue will be present for several years providing a disease bridge from one crop, through the rotation crop and into the subsequent crop (Figure 19). This is a minor but considerable production risk that must be accounted for in agronomic management with fungicide application and crop and variety choice. Consequently, some growers may opt for the double break management strategy to offset this risk, while still retaining adequate levels of crop residue.  4.4 Nutrient tie up  It has been reported that a third of crop nutrient is removed in the grain at harvest, one-third remains in the stubble fraction above the soil, and one-third remains in the root fraction. With crop residue persisting for longer periods, so too are the nutrients that are stored in the remaining crop residue. This delay in the nutrient cycle will cause nutritional shortfalls if not addressed adequately in nutritional programming. For example, a 5t/ha wheat stubble would have 38 units of nitrogen tied up (82kgs urea equivalent), which in stripper straw may take twice as long as draper cut residue to mineralise and return to the available pool of nutrients.  4.5 Mice, rodents and slugs  Unfortunately, long straw provides habitat for rodents, in particular mice. It removes the ability for predators to hunt easily providing them with an environment to thrive with a food source and cover. This can be a considerable risk at seeding time if not dealt with. Fortunately, zinc phosphide baiting with the seeding application (through small seeds box or bait spreaders mounted to the machine) has been very effective at controlling mice at an estimated cost of AUD $5 per hectare. Slugs are a substantial pest in higher rainfall areas. With limited experience in this area, my prediction is that slugs will thrive in a cooler moisture environment provided by increasing crop residue and moisture levels. More research needs to be done in this area in the future.  4.6 Capital cost The stripper header in 2023 comes in at approximately AUD $170,000 + GST + trailer. This is an additional capital cost to a business and means that up to three fronts for a combine harvester, a draper platform, a stripper header and a pickup header may be needed. However, with increased harvest efficiency and reduction in fuel burn over the lifetime of the machine this will go well on its way to paying for itself, as well as the ability to downsize one combine class while retaining similar or greater output.   \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n36  \nChapter 5: Effect of residue on summer crop (cotton) production Summer crops require minimum temperatures for seeds to germinate and establish, for cotton ideally this is 14oC at 8am, with a predicted rising plane of soil temperature. The same factors that help reduce evaporation and reduce soil temperature in fallow periods also apply to fields planned for summer crops with heavy residue loads. This residue reflects light and solar radiation off the soil surface and back into the atmosphere, lowering soil temperature as a result. This provides the same benefits mentioned earlier, increasing water storage and fallow efficiency prior to planting and increasing WUE throughout the growing season. In locations with long growing seasons or dryland scenarios, this is not an issue because there is time to wait for the soil to warm up to adequate planting temperatures. In irrigated crops in regions with short growing seasons, however, this is not the case and strategies must be implemented to negate this effect or yield penalties could occur. Most summer crops are grown in row crop configurations of 100cm or 75cm spacing or multiples of these widths respectively. Due to the relatively wide spacings of row crop rows, it allows for residue to be moved out of the plant line and into the inter-row. Management techniques have been developed for irrigated crops to partially circumvent this issue prior to planting by running residue row cleaners or strip tillage techniques to move residue out of the plant row. Ideally, this should be done well before planting to give adequate time for the soil to warm up. If this is not achieved soil temperatures can remain lower for longer compromising germination and in cool temperatures, and in wet years will compromise planting conditions by exacerbating moist conditions. It has been widely reported the benefits of crop residue in summer crop production predominantly in sprinkler or drip irrigated systems and dryland scenarios. These benefits include: • eliminating sand blasting of seedlings, • increasing water infiltration and reducing run off or ponding, • reducing evaporation, especially prior to row closure, • reducing soil pore damage from water droplet impact, increasing infiltration, • increased Integrated Pest Management (IPM) by severe reduction in thrip presence, and • weed suppression in the inter-row, and increased weed control from fresher weeds for longer.  However, long residue remaining from stripper fronts has not been compatible with fully irrigated conventional furrow farming systems, providing significantly reduced trash flow during ground preparations, and blocking irrigation pipes, drains and recirculation systems. Stripper straw must be mulched into smaller pieces and incorporated to allow for ground preparation to be accomplished. Where it could be adopted is in red soils on zero or flat grade bank-less irrigation with infiltration issues, slowing water movement on and off the fields, increasing water penetration and water use efficiency from increased soil cover. However, fresh cover crops seem to be a better fit in this space as they are not as bulky and persist longer under furrow irrigation environments. This is expanded upon in the next chapter, Cover crops. \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n37  \nWhere real opportunities with stripper straw present themselves are with zero tillage dryland cotton production, or limited water semi-irrigated cotton production due to its ability to catch and store more rainfall moisture and prevent evaporation in the inter-row. This would result in increased moisture storage, an increase in water use efficiency, and increased bales per megalitre. It would be necessary to do any ground preparation required, grow and harvest the cereal crop, and then long fallow through to cotton planting in a zero-till style to achieve the full benefit of the system. Harvest needs to be considered especially in conditions with low fruit set where picking cabinets or stripper harvesters are close to the ground, tall standing stubble can cause issues with the harvesting process. This stubble is best to be rolled in the direction of the planting and picking direction where possible. \n Figure 20 Semi irrigated cotton being planted behind stripped wheat, highlighting the importance RTK GPS for effective inter-row sowing, and ability of disc planters to plant through high residue situations.

Lance said residue retention was an important part of their farming system for the reasons mentioned above in this chapter, particularly to fight the damage from sandstorms. They had residue choppers to cut cotton and corn stalks after harvest to retain residue on the soil surface.\n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n38  \n Figure 21 a stalk chopper at lance and Danielle Williams Panhandle TX USA used to destroy old crop rows while retaining crop residue on the soil surface.

Cover crops are planted with a primary purpose in mind, for example, to prevent seedling damage from sand blasting/sandstorms, or to hold and store nutrients in plant material to prevent nutrient loss, or to sequester nitrogen from the atmosphere with legumes and rhizobia.  Cover crops have proven to be successful in several scenarios around the world, most of those in higher rainfall farming environments and predominately with the aim of adsorbing and storing excess nutrients to prevent them from leeching or running off into water ways, while encompassing the added benefit of increased soil health from more live roots. This was very common practice throughout the high rainfall regions of the USA (including Iowa, North and South Dakota, Nebraska and Illinois to name a few as shown in Figure 22), and very common throughout Europe and the UK. \n Figure 22 A custom built cover crop seeding machine, adapted to a high clearance sprayer to seed cover crops in growing corn crops in Iowa USA, featuring impressed fellow scholar Billy Browning at a Heatland Co-Op field day in July 2022, near West Des Moines Iowa. (Source: Author) Another example of cover crops being used, this time in dryer conditions is in high wind arid environments to protect seedling from sandstorms and prevent “sand blasting” of seedlings upon emergence. This was common practice in west Texas to prevent ring barking and subsequent damage of cotton seedlings. We saw this in detail on our travels at Walker McNair, and Dan Taylor’s farms near Panhandle and Lubbock . Texas, USA, respectively. Walker was planting cereal Rye in September and \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n40  \nterminating in April. This was also to help combat water restrictions on irrigation ground water pumping capacity. Walker’s comments were that the cover is helping no doubt, for weed suppression particularly for hard to kill weeds such as parma amaranth and eliminating sand blasting, both common issues in west Texas. Walker believed that the rye cover crop was a particularly important part of growing wide row cotton when utilizing acres subject to water restrictions. Lance and Danielle Williams also attributed to how they needed to have some sort of crop residue on the soil surface to prevent damage from sandstorms to newly emerging crops, predominately cotton and corn. This is also now common practice of Australian cotton growers on drip or sprinkler irrigation systems, and some furrow scenarios, and has been for over 10 years.  \n Figure 23 Bill Browning, Walker McNair and Richard Quigley in Walkers’s water limited wide row (60”) Cotton with a sacrificial Rye cover crop near Clarendon, TX, July 2023. (Source: Author) There is also an argument that a growing crop during the winter months will collect more moisture from the air through overnight dew than traditional fallows with stubble retention practices. The theory is that cumulatively over a period can harvest moisture and store it in the soil profile for utilisation later (Scott McCalman, pers. comm.). In lower rainfall environments, (like the majority of Australia), there is not often the surplus moisture available to grow both cover crops and cash crops (or double crop cash crops) in the same year in dryland farming systems, unless above average rainfall is received. Dry environments are regularly limited by water availability for plant growth and crop production. If both are attempted, chances are that one will fail. Prioritizing water usage for cash crops in dry climates is essential to maintain productivity and remain economically viable. This is the crux of conservation tillage practices adopted by the majority of Australian grain and cotton growers mentioned earlier in this report. \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n41  \nMost of the grain and cotton growing regions in Australia are not typically high rainfall like other countries, so nutrient loss is also not a common reason for adopting the growing of cover crops.  Increased crop residue on the soil surface provides most of the benefits of a cover crop while still being able to produce cash crops that are both economically and environmentally sustainable.  \n Figure 24 Richard Quigley and Dan Taylor in Dan’s Cotton with a sacrificial wheat cover crop near Ropesville, Texas, July 2023. (Source: Author) Cover crops are being trialed in large scale field trials and are becoming more common in Australian furrow irrigated farming systems that have troublesome soil types to irrigate. These troublesome soil types seal up after subsequent irrigations and subsequently have poor infiltration and reduced crop yields as a result, and are traditionally seen on lighter red soil types (sandy clay loams) compounded by steeper field grades (0.1% or greater). Crover crops grown purposefully to increase infiltration in quick succession of planting irrigated summer crops have been very successful to combating these issues.  Cover crops seem to be more effective than old crop residue as fresh cover crops are well anchored to the soil and have current root canals that help significantly with water infiltration and increasing friction in the furrow reducing the speed of water flow. These cover crops have traditionally been cereal crops, however with the recent incorporation of Bayer’s Extend Flex Cotton traits (dicamba, glufosinate and glyphosate tolerant) legumes and brassicas can now be incorporated into these cover crop systems to create mixed species cover crops that can fix nitrogen and help with cotton disease management. I think this will be prevalent in cover crops of the future of Australian Cotton farming systems. Cover crop root systems also feed the soil microbiology with their exudates stimulating and promoting soil health.   \n\nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n42  \n Figure 25 Photo of Billy Browning’s mixed species cover crop nearing termination on a historically poor irrigation infiltration soil type, to increase soil health and infiltration throughout the irrigation season, near Narromine, NSW. (Source: Author)      \n\n1  \nConclusion  From this Nuffield research, travel and farm visits, as well as experiences on the authors’ own farm, stripper headers are compatible with modern zero tillage grain production and dryland summer crop farming systems in Australia. Increased PAW, increased yields, increased harvester efficiency and reduced costs are all compatible with stripper header implementation, ultimately increasing profitability and sustainability. Consideration must be taken for soil temperature, frost, planting timings, seeder trash flow capabilities, increased pest and disease pressure, and herbicide challenges. I see the most benefit from stripper headers and increased levels of crop residue in Australia’s semi-arid grain growing regions, and the benefits will be reduced in higher rainfall and cooler environments. Small cumulative increases in stored soil moisture and increased water use efficiency of crops grown will make considerable increases in profitability as growing costs are not significantly increased but production is, especially in below average rainfall years. Reduction in weed germination and growth will be observed with stripper header uptake, as well as weeds being actively growing for longer making weeds easier to control in adverse conditions reducing pressure on herbicide control options.  Significant Increases in harvester efficiency and throughput are observed with stripper headers, along with reduced engine load and fuel burn and reduced wear and tear on combines, resulting in a reduced cost per tonne or per hectare harvested. Stripper headers also provided longer operating hours as they are much less affected by damp straw throughout the night, increasing daily harvester hours. This is combined with a reduction in fuel burn by up to 50% due to processing less crop volume in the combine harvester. Stripper headers are not compatible with conventional furrow irrigated cotton production in Australia without residue management techniques to move or mulch long cereal residue. This is mainly due to hindrance of ground preparation from trash flow issues blocking implements and creating poor or uneven seed bed conditions and hindering irrigation activities by long straw impeding irrigation practices, particularly in blocking furrows, drains, pumps and pipes in the recycling of irrigation water. Residue reduces flow of water through Mannings formula and can result in water logging. Manageable crop residue is however a very important part of cotton production, particularly in sprinkler and drip irrigated cotton and dryland areas to reduce the effects of sand blasting and early insect predation from thrips, and increase infiltration and water use efficiency.  Cover crops are an increasingly valuable tool in Australian cotton production with the implementation of Extend Flex herbicide traits allowing for the incorporation of harder to kill mixed species cover crops, allowing nitrogen fixing and disease benefits. This will be more prevalent in sprinkler and drip irrigation, as well as furrow irrigated areas with known infiltration issues. Stripper headers are considered a tool of conservation agriculture that is applicable to large scale grain farms across Australia in semi-arid grain growing regions, which will increase the sustainability and profitability of farm businesses. A very high level of attention to detail is required to implement the management techniques outlined in the strip and disc farming system. Without this attention to detail and the high levels of accuracy required undesirable results will occur. \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n2  \n Recommendations From my research into this topic, I make the following recommendations: • Implementation of the strip and disc farming system into semi-arid grain growing regions of Australia will increase crop production and profitability without considerably increasing cost of production. Conservative estimates expect an increase in fallow efficiency of 10%, of which if moisture is limiting could be converted into an additional 500kgs wheat/ha or an additional $125/ha AUD in grain income at long term wheat prices. • Implementation of the strip and disc system should provide planting opportunities in marginal or dry years that may not be there in conventional zero tillage systems or full tillage systems.  • Implementation of the strip and disc system should reduce severity of the effects drought in your business.  • The strip and disc system is less compatible in higher rainfall environments and environments prone to slugs. • Significant research and strict attention to details needs to go into the system to gain the full plethora of benefits. • Significant research needs to go into correct combine setup to ensure unsatisfactory grain loss is not observed.  • The strip and disc system is not compatible with conventional furrow irrigation systems that dominate the Australian cotton industry.  • Cover crops will continue to be pivotal in sprinkler and drip irrigated cotton crops, as well as difficult to irrigate furrow irrigated soils and should be implemented where possible. • Cover crops for cotton production should incorporate mixed species to fix nitrogen and combat disease, to get a free kick while reaping the benefits of traditional cover crop usage. Further research needs to be undertaken in the following areas: • Harvester efficiency, losses and throughput. Combines are capable of greater than 100t per hour in crops like corn. More research is required as to why similar results from combines with a stripper header that is just separating the grain from the chaff fraction cannot be achieved without excessive grain loss. Currently, machines investigated are limited by grain loss and threshing capability.  • Explore other combine types, and their setup to maximise throughput and reduce loss. This should focus on exploration into twin rotor combines (New Holland CR series and JD X series), and drum threshing combines (Class) with large separating areas.  • Investigate the amount of carbon stored for longer periods in the stripper disc system. Crop residue is taking up to an additional 12 months to break down, resulting in a carbon sink for this additional period. • Research into if the strip and disc system can increase soil organic matter through reducing soil temperature and increasing levels of crop residue. \nHigh Residue Zero-till Farming Systems in Central West NSW \n3  \nReferences  Amézketa, E., 1999, ‘Aggregate Stability: A Review.

For Public Release  \n \nRecognition of support: The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries \nacknowledges the financial assistance of the Cotton Research and Development Corporation \nin order to undertake this project. \n \nSummary for public release \n \nExecutive Summary This report represents a continuation of “Impacts and Solutions: A \nscoping study on the relative impacts of irrigation infrastructure on \nfish in the Fitzroy Basin” (Hutchison et al. 2022). This original study \nwas initiated to understand how different types of irrigation \ninfrastructure and hydrological conditions contributed to entrainment \nof fishes into irrigation systems. This knowledge assisted with \ndevelopment of a prioritisation matrix, to direct mitigation measures \nto where there was the greatest need. \nIn the current study, supplementary data was collected to boost the \nstatistical power of the original data set. The aim was to determine if \nthe patterns observed in the original study were maintained and \nsupported by statistical significance to provide more confidence in \nthe recommendations from the original report. The increased data set \nand revised statistical analyses would also assist with refinement of \nthe original prioritisation matrix. \nAnalysis of the enhanced data set largely confirmed the patterns \nobserved in the original study. A comparison of a gravity fed and \npumped offtakes from Fairbairn Dam in the original data set indicated \nthat fish were entrained at greater rates through the gravity fed \ndiversion than the pumped diversion (Hutchison et al. 2022). With the \ninclusion of the supplementary data, this was statistically significant \nfor several species and size classes, and across all species combined. \nInlet flow rates had little impact on this result. Gravity fed diversions \nshould be a high priority for mitigation with modern self-cleaning \nscreening systems. \nFor irrigation systems that pump water from rivers, there was a \ngeneral tendency for increased numbers of fish to be entrained per \nunit time as pumping rate (ML per day) increased. The number of \ndifferent species entrained per unit time also increased with pumping \nrate. This trend was consistent across many species, although not \nstatistically significant for most due to high variability in catch rates \nbetween different flow events. The steepness of the relationship \n\n  \n  2 of 5 \nbetween pump rate and fish entrained per unit time varied between \nspecies. When considering entrainment rates on a volumetric basis, \nthere was still a positive relationship evident, but the upward trend \nwas more gradual than might have been expected. These results \nsuggest that pumping rate does have an impact on entrainment rates, \nbut the effect of pumping rates is probably less important than some \nother factors such as flow type and intake location and depth. \nThe current study confirmed that flow type has a significant influence \non entrainment rates. In the original study, entrainment rates were \nfound to be very low on overbank (flood) flows. This trend continued \nwith the addition of supplementary data. Low entrainment rates on \nflood flows are probably partly due to the dilution effect of large \nvolumes of water and partly due to fish inhabiting habitats inundated \nover the banks and away from the irrigation intakes. When water \nlevels drop back to the main river channel, fish are more vulnerable to \nentrainment. In the original study it was suggested that natural within \nbank flows had a tendency for marginally higher entrainment rates \nthan allocated (supplemental) within-bank flows. With the addition of \nthe supplementary data, it is apparent that natural within-bank flows \ncan lead to entrainment rates approximately double that of \nentrainment rates on allocated (supplemental) flows. This is probably \nbecause fish migrations are more likely to be triggered on natural \nflow events. In general, larvae are entrained at higher rates on natural \nflow events, although carp gudgeon larvae are entrained more \nfrequently on allocated flows. This probably reflects the fact that \nspecies with pelagic larvae tend to spawn on natural flow events. \nThe current study also confirmed that for most species and size \nclasses of fish (including overall entrainment rates for all species \ncombined), bankside shallow intakes generally entrained far fewer \nfish than other inlet types (e.g., bankside deep intakes, mid-channel \ndeep intakes and intakes from side channels perpendicular to the \nriver). Inlet location and depth appears to be more important than \npump rate. \nBased on these findings a prioritisation matrix has been developed to \nassist with decision making on where investment in mitigation \nmeasures (e.g. screening with modern self-cleaning fish screens) \nshould be directed to have the most impact. The matrix is virtually \nidentical to that produced by Hutchison et al. (2022) with some minor \nchanges to one of the factors. \nThe factors used in the matrix include pumping rate, pump intake \nposition and depth (intake configuration), flow types pumped and \nannual licensed allocation (total volume licensed to pump of any flow \ntype).The metrics used for three of the four factors remain unchanged \nfrom Hutchison et al. (2022), but within the factor flow type, the \nweighting for natural within-bank flows has been updated to reflect \nthat these flows on average have double the entrainment rate of \nallocated (supplemental) flows. By cross multiplying the metrics for \nthese different categories, an overall score can be derived for \ndifferent pumps in a river. The highest scoring pumps will be those \npredicted to be in the greatest need of mitigation action. However, for \nmitigation actions, feasibility and cost, based on the specific site \ncharacteristics also need to be considered. In some cases, better \noutcomes for fish per unit cost may be achieved by screening several \nslightly lower ranked pumps, rather than expending a large amount of \n  \n  3 of 5 \nresources on a single highly ranked pump that is logistically difficult \nor expensive to screen. A more cost-effective time to consider \nscreening can be when pumps have reached the end of their useful \nlife and require replacement. \nThe following recommendations have been derived from this \nresearch project. \n1.      Data from this project suggests that gravity fed diversions have a \nhigh impact, but only one such diversion was monitored. Further \ninvestigations into impacts of riverine gravity fed diversions are \nrecommended. \n2.      Pumped diversions can be prioritised using a four-part scoring \nsystem that considers flow type being pumped, intake configuration \n(location and depth), pump rate and total volume pumped per annum. \nConsideration also needs to be given to the costs and feasibility of \nscreening a site as part of the prioritisation process. \n3.      Future pumped irrigation developments should consider \nfactoring in screening at the design and construction phase when it \nwill be most cost-effective to install screens, compared to retrofitting \nthem later. When existing pumps reach the end of their useful life, \nscreening of the replacement pump should also be considered \nbecause it will be more cost effective. \n \nObjectives • To collect supplementary data to improve statistical power to \nprovide more confidence in the trends observed in the original \n\"Impacts and solutions\" report. \nThis was to support the objective from the original impacts and \nsolutions report \n• Evaluate the relative impact of different irrigation infrastructure \ntypes and practices on fish \nBackground  The original impacts and solutions report was produced based on the \nfollowing. \nThe cotton industry is under constant scrutiny from the public and the \ngovernment, particularly in relation to its water use and the impacts \nthat this may have or be perceived to have on the environment. It had \nrecently been recognised that irrigation infrastructure was entraining \nnative fish. Native fish are an environmental asset highly valued by \nthe public.  Fish form the basis of recreational fishing activities, are \nkey environmental condition indicators, and are of social, economic \nand cultural significance.  Recent drought related fish kills in the \nMurray-Darling Basin heightened the public’s focus on fish in \nregulated rivers. Actions that can be taken to maintain or increase the \nproductivity of fish populations will be viewed favourably by the \ngeneral community and serve to promote a positive image regarding \nthe sustainability of the cotton industry. This project was developed to \nassist the cotton industry to understand the scope of the issue and to \nguide where mitigation efforts should be focused. \nThe supplementary report was run in response to a recommendation \nfrom the original report which is as follows. \nFurther replication of sampling will provide more confidence in the \nmetrics for flow type being pumped, intake location and depth, and \npump rate. \n  \n  4 of 5 \nResearch activities This project continued the research from the original impacts and \nsolutions project, using identical sampling methods. The addtional \ndata collected were added to the original data set for statistical \nanalyses. \nThis work was field based research that evaluated the relative impact \nof different types of irrigation infrastructure on fish entrainment rates. \nTypes of infrastructure examined included gravity fed diversions and \npumped diversions. For pumped diversions, factors such as intake \nposition (bankside, mid-river channel, side-channel) and depth, \npumping rate and flow type (natural or allocated) were investigated. \nThis work enabled development of a prioritisation matrix to help \nguide the industry where to invest in mitigation measures. the \nincreased data set led to more statistically significant results and an \nimproved understanding of the patterns observed. Data analyses \ncomparing entrainment rates through different infrastructure and \nunder different flow conditions used generalized linear models, and \nsusceptibility of different species and size classes to entrainment was \nanalysed by one way ANOVA. \n \nOutputs This project found that gravity fed diversions tend to entrain more fish \nthan pumped diversions, although it is recommended this is \ninvestigated further in other catchments where gravity fed diversions \nare more prevalent, to provide better replication. Within pumped \ndiversions, pumping rate, flow type pumped, and inlet \nconfiguration (position and depth) can all influence the number of fish \nentrained. Bankside shallow pumped intakes seemed to have the \nleast impact. Intake configuration found to have a significant influence \non entrainment rates. Pumping from within-bank natural flows tended \nto entrain more fish than pumping during allocated (supplemental) \nflows. Pumping during overbank flood flows entrained the least \namount of fish. Using the results of this work a prioritisation matrix for \nriverine pumps was developed that considers pump inlet location and \ndepth, pumping rate (ML per day), flow type pumped and total annual \nallocation (extraction) for that pump. \n·        The relative impacts are summarised in an information sheet. \n·        The final report contains worked examples of the prioritisation \nprocess and these are also presented in an information sheet. \nFollowing the recommendations of the final report should assist in \ndirecting investment to reduce entrainment of fish in the most \nbeneficial and cost-effective way. \n \nImpacts  This research has identified the types of irrigation infrastructure and \nflow events that are more likely to lead to entrainment of high \nnumbers of fish. Low risk infrastructure has also been identified. This \nhas led to the development of a prioritisation matrix that can assist \nwith directing where mitigation measures should be implemented.  \nThe matrix has been refined from that presented in the original study \nbut is broadly similar. This should lead to improving cotton’s \nenvironmental footprint in the most cost-effective way.

……………………………...48 \n \n1 \n \nSummary \nThis report represents a continuation of “Impacts and Solutions: A scoping study on the relative impacts of \nirrigation infrastructure on fish in the Fitzroy Basin” (Hutchison et al. 2022). This original study was initiated to \nunderstand how different types of irrigation infrastructure and hydrological conditions contributed to \nentrainment of fishes into irrigation systems. This knowledge assisted with development of a prioritisation \nmatrix, to direct mitigation measures to where there was the greatest need.  \nIn the current study, supplementary data was collected to boost the statistical power of the original data set. \nThe aim was to determine if the patterns observed in the original study were maintained and supported by \nstatistical significance to provide more confidence in the recommendations from the original report. The \nincreased data set and revised statistical analyses would also assist with refinement of the original \nprioritisation matrix. \nAnalysis of the enhanced data set largely confirmed the patterns observed in the original study. A \ncomparison of a gravity fed and pumped offtakes from Fairbairn Dam in the original data set indicated that \nfish were entrained at greater rates through the gravity fed diversion than the pumped diversion (Hutchison \net al. 2022). With the inclusion of the supplementary data, this was statistically significant for several species \nand size classes, and across all species combined. Inlet flow rates had little impact on this result. Gravity fed \ndiversions should be a high priority for mitigation with modern self-cleaning screening systems. \nFor irrigation systems that pump water from rivers, there was a general tendency for increased numbers of \nfish to be entrained per unit time as pumping rate (ML per day) increased. The number of different species \nentrained per unit time also increased with pumping rate. This trend was consistent across many species, \nalthough not statistically significant for most due to high variability in catch rates between different flow \nevents. The steepness of the relationship between pump rate and fish entrained per u nit time varied between \nspecies. When considering entrainment rates on a volumetric basis, there was still a positive relationship \nevident, but the upward trend was more gradual than might have been expected. These results suggest that \npumping rate does have an impact on entrainment rates, but the effect of pumping rates is probably less \nimportant than some other factors such as flow type and intake location and depth. \nThe current study confirmed that flow type has a significant influence on entrainment rates. In the original \nstudy, entrainment rates were found to be very low on overbank (flood) flows. This trend continued with the \naddition of supplementary data. Low entrainment rates on flood flows are probably partly due to the dilution \neffect of large volumes of water and partly due to fish inhabiting habitats inundated over the banks and away \nfrom the irrigation intakes. When water levels drop back to the main river channel, fish are more vulnerable \nto entrainment. In the original study it was suggested that natural within bank flows had a tendency for \nmarginally higher entrainment rates than allocated (supplemental) within-bank flows. With the addition of the \nsupplementary data, it is apparent that natural within-bank flows can lead to entrainment rates approximately \ndouble that of entrainment rates on allocated (supplemental) flows. This is probably because fish migrations \nare more likely to be triggered on natural flow events. In general, larvae are entrained at higher rates on \nnatural flow events, although carp gudgeon larvae are entrained more frequently on allocated flows. This \nprobably reflects the fact that species with pelagic larvae tend to spawn on natural flow events.  \nThe current study also confirmed that for most species and size classes of fish (including overall entrainment \nrates for all species combined), bankside shallow intakes generally entrained far fewer fish than other inlet \ntypes (e.g., bankside deep intakes, mid-channel deep intakes and intakes from side channels perpendicular \nto the river). Inlet location and depth appears to be more important than pump rate.  \nBased on these findings a prioritisation matrix has been developed to assist with decision making on where \ninvestment in mitigation measures (e.g. screening with modern self-cleaning fish screens) should be directed \nto have the most impact. The matrix is virtually identical to that produced by Hutchison et al. (2022) with \nsome minor changes to one of the factors. \nThe factors used in the matrix include pumping rate, pump intake position and depth (intake configuration), \nflow types pumped and annual licensed allocation (total volume licensed to pump of any flow type). The \nmetrics used for three of the four factors remain unchanged from Hutchison et al. (2022), but within the factor \nflow type, the weighting for natural within-bank flows has been updated to reflect that these flows on average \n \n2 \n \nhave double the entrainment rate of allocated (supplemental) flows. By cross multiplying the metrics for \nthese different categories, an overall score can be derived for different pumps in a river. The highest scoring \npumps will be those predicted to be in the greatest need of mitigation action. However, for mitigation actions, \nfeasibility and cost, based on the specific site characteristics also need to be considered. In some cases, \nbetter outcomes for fish per unit cost may be achieved by screening several slightly lower ranked pumps, \nrather than expending a large amount of resources on a single highly ranked pump that is logistically difficult \nor expensive to screen. A more cost-effective time to consider screening can be when pumps have reached \nthe end of their useful life and require replacement. \nThe following recommendations have been derived from this research project.  \n1. Data from this project suggests that gravity fed diversions have a high impact, but only one such \ndiversion was monitored. Further investigations into impacts of riverine gravity fed diversions are \nrecommended.  \n2. Pumped diversions can be prioritised using a four-part scoring system that considers flow type being \npumped, intake configuration (location and depth), pump rate and total volume pumped per annum. \nConsideration also needs to be given to the costs and feasibility of screening a site as part of the \nprioritisation process. \n3. Future pumped irrigation developments should consider factoring in screening at the design and \nconstruction phase when it will be most cost-effective to install screens, compared to retrofitting them \nlater. When existing pumps reach the end of their useful life, screening of the replacement pump \nshould also be considered because it will be more cost effective. \n  \n \n3 \n \nIntroduction \nJustification for collection of supplementary data \nIn 2022, DAF submitted a final report to the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) \noutlining results and recommendations of a scoping study on the relative impacts of irrigation infrastructure \non fish in the Fitzroy Basin in the vicinity of Comet and Emerald (Hutchison et al. 2022). This project \ninvestigated entrainment of fish through riverine pumps and whether pumping rate and pump intake position \n(proximity to bank and depth) made any difference to entrainment rates of fish. The research project also \ninvestigated whether fish were more susceptible to entrainment through riverine pumps on different levels of \nnatural flow events or supplementary flows releases from irrigation dams. In addition, the study examined \nentrainment of fish in pumped and gravity fed irrigation channels originating from Fairbairn Dam. This work \nled to the following recommendations. \n1. Gravity fed diversions should be considered a high priority for mitigation of impacts to fish. Further \ninvestigations into impacts of riverine gravity fed diversions are recommended.  \n2. Pumped diversions can be prioritised using a four-part scoring system that considers flow type being \npumped, intake location and depth (intake configuration), pump rate and total volume pumped per \nannum. Consideration also needs to be given to feasibility of screening a site (including cost) as part \nof the prioritisation process. \n3. Future pumped irrigation developments should consider factoring in screening at the design and \nconstruction phase when it will be cheaper to install screens, compared to retrofitting them later.  \n4. Further replication of sampling will provide more confidence in the metrics for flow type being \npumped, intake location and depth, and pump rate. \n5. Further research needs to be conducted into the cost-benefits of screening to provide irrigators \nconfidence that pump screening will not significantly impact on their financial position.  \nPoint five in the above list is now being addressed through research by the NSW Department of Primary \nIndustries. Point four recommended further replication of sampling to provide more confidence in the metrics \nfor flow type being pumped, intake location and depth, and pump rate. This recommendation came about \nbecause although there were clear patterns and trends repeated across several different species, high \nvariation in catch rates and sampling rates of fish (which is typical of fisheries data)  resulted in not all \npatterns being statistically significant for many species. One such pattern was that near bank shallow water \npump intakes tended to entrain fewer fish than other intake types. Multiple lines of evidence and some \nsignificant findings for some fish species gave some confidence in the data, but it was felt that further \nreplication would give more power to the data interpretation and strengthen the robustness of \nrecommendations. This current project has collected some supplementary data to add to the original data set \ncompiled by Hutchison et al. (2022).  This combined data set has been reanalysed to determine if the \npatterns remain consistent with the original findings and if any further statistically significant findings are \ndetected to improve confidence in the use of the prioritisation metrics developed in the 2022 report.  \nKey patterns observed in the 2022 report. \nSome of the patterns reported by Hutchison et al. 2022 included the following:   \n1. The numbers of fish entrained across several species tended to be lower through bankside shallow \ninlets. However, despite the pattern being consistent, this was only statistically significant for a \nlimited number of species and size classes. The lack of significance was mainly driven by high \nvariability in entrainment rates across the other inlet types, rather than through large variation at the \nbankside shallow sites.  \n2. The number of species entrained per unit time was significantly less at bankside shallow sites.  The \nnumber of species and the number of individual fish entrained (across many species) tended to \nincrease as pump rates increased, but this trend was only statistically significant for the number of \nspecies entrained and for bony bream greater than 100 mm fork length (FL). \n \n4 \n \n3. Very few fish were entrained during over-bank natural flows. Entrainment rates were higher during \nwithin-bank flows. \n4. There was no significant difference across most species for entrainment rates between natural and \nallocated within-bank flows, but there was a tendency for more large fish to be entrained on natural \nflow events and for golden perch larvae to be entrained on natural flow events. \n5. Entrainment rates for spangled perch showed no tendency to increase as pump rates went up. This \nsuggested spangled perch (especially large-spangled perch) may actively swim into lateral offtake \ncurrents. Fish entrained per megalitre (ML) was marginally positive across most species as pumping \nrates increased. \n6. The original report also examined if there were any significant differences in the size (length \nfrequency) distribution of fish in the river versus the size of fish being entrained. In general, within \nspecies, smaller-sized fish were generally more susceptible to entrainment than larger fish, and this \nwas usually statistically significant. There were some exceptions. Larger spangled perch and olive \nperchlet were significantly over-represented in some pump samples compared to riverine samples, \nespecially during the warmer months. This suggests that pumps may have intercepted these species \nduring a spawning migration. Both species spawn in off-river wetlands, so these fish may have been \nseeking currents lateral to the river flow, to lead them into wetlands and may have actively swum into \nthe irrigation offtakes.   \nFish size frequency comparisons between river or impoundment reference site samples and entrained fish \nsamples will not be further investigated in this supplementary report as the data collected previously was \nalready clear cut and mostly statistically significant. The original report also ranked fish species and size \nclasses by their susceptibility.  This is revisited in this current report, especially to provide a ranking for some \nof the rarer riverine species that may have been caught too infrequently in the original survey for an accurate \nranking. Also, some additional species and size classes were entrained during supplementary data \ncollection, enabling a more comprehensive list of species that are entrained to be compiled . \nThe current document should be treated as a companion document to Hutchison et al. (2022). The main \nobjective is to either confirm trends through statistical modelling observed in the original study or to identify \nany new trends and information detected through collection of supplementary data. \nThe sampling and statistical methods used in this study are essentially identical those used in the original \nstudy by Hutchison et al. (2022). \nMethods \nAs outlined above, the methods used in this study were identical to those used in the original study by \nHutchison et al. (2022). The data from the original study and the supplementary study were combined into a \nsingle comprehensive dataset. The methods from the original report are reprinted here for the convenience \nof the reader, with some updates to include the additional sampling. The statistical method that examined \nlength frequency distributions of fish in the original study is excluded from the current  study as length \nfrequency data required no further investigation. Given the higher water levels in Fairbairn Dam during the \nsupplementary period compared to the original data collection period, “dam capacity %” has been added as \nan additional variable to be investigated for its influence on entrainment of fish into the diversion channels \nexiting Fairbairn Dam. \nExperimental design \nThis project opportunistically sampled pump outlets on cotton farms for entrained fish during natural and \nallocated flows in the period from October 2023 to March 2024. These data were combined with data \ncollected by Hutchison et al. (2022) between January 2021 and March 2022 for analyses. The pumps \nextracted water from the Nogoa, Mackenzie and Comet Rivers. For privacy reasons we have not identified \nthe individual farms involved in this survey, but Figure 1 shows a map of the general region where the \nsurveys were completed. A diverse range of pump sizes were selected, ranging from extraction rates of 14 \nmegalitres (ML) per day up to 164 ML per day (Table 1). Intake positions included bankside, mid-river \nchannel (at least several metres from the bank edge), and within an excavated side channel perpendicular to \nthe river (Figure 2). The pump intakes were set at various water depths. Intakes where the top of the intake \n \n5 \n \nwas situated less than 1 m below the water surface during normal allocated flow or base flow levels were \nclassified as shallow, and intakes where the top of the intake site sat greater than 1 m below the surface on \na baseflow or normal allocated flow were classified as deep. This resulted in four intake position and depth \nconfigurations in this study: bankside shallow, bankside deep, mid-river channel deep and side channel \nshallow.  \nPumping events were monitored from allocated flows released from Fairbairn Dam, and from natural flows, \nwhich included both within bank and overbank flows. Overbank flows were where water covered at least the \nriverside bench. The number of samples collected was limited by the number of growers pumping on any \ngiven flow, and by the frequency of flows. Rainfall events that helped water crops and generated overland \nflows that allowed growers to fill storage tanks, meant that there were fewer pumping events from the rivers \nthan anticipated during the supplementary sampling period. The key factors investigated were pump size, \npump intake location and depth, and flow type.  \nEntrainment of fish into irrigation diversion channels originating from Fairbairn Dam (Figure 3) were also \nevaluated (Table 1). There are two irrigation diversions, the Selma Channel and the Weemah Channel, \nwhich have different intake configurations. Depending on the water level in Fairbairn Dam, the Selma \nchannel is either gravity fed (>68% dam capacity) or fed by three variable discharge pumps (<68% dam \ncapacity). During the study period Fairbairn Dam levels varied between 14% and 44% capacity. \nTable 1: Summary of pumps, diversion channels and flow events monitored \nPump site code Intake type                \n(position and depth) \nExtraction rate \n(ML/day) \nAllocated flows \n(count) \nNatural flows \n(count) \n1 Bankside deep 100 1 2 \n3 Side-channel shallow 42-51 1 3 \n4 Mid-river channel deep 27-56 1 2 \n7 Bankside shallow 80-164 2 3 \n8 Bankside deep 100 2 1 \n9 Bankside shallow 22.5-30 2  \n11 (Selma Channel) Pumped diversion from dam 75-420 6  \n12 (Weemah Channel) Gravity diversion from dam 75-259 6  \n13 Mid-river channel deep 88.5 1  \n15 Bankside shallow 90-140 2  \n16 Bankside deep 90-100  2 \n17 Mid-river channel deep 14-14.5 3  \n19 Side-channel shallow 80-100 1 1 \n \nTherefore, the Selma channel was supplied solely by pumping during sampling. The Weemah channel is \nalways gravity fed through a 6 m diameter pipe at the bottom of the dam wall, with flow rates set using \ncontrol gates in the intake tower (Figure 3). Key variables examined for the diversion channels were outlet \nflow rate (changing according to irrigator demand) and outlet type. Monitored discharge rates ranged from 75 \nML per day to 400 ML per day. Seasonal variation was also considered, as the thermocline (wh ich forms in \nsummer usually at a depth between 4 - 8 m below the surface) could possibly influence where fish sit in the \nwater column relative to the channel intakes. Most fish are likely to avoid the deoxygenated water below the \nthermocline. Water temperatures may also affect fish activity levels (Volkoff and Rønnestad 2020) and \ntherefore susceptibility to entrainment. During the study period, low water levels in Fairbairn Dam meant that \nthe intake site for the Weemah diversion and the pump intake for the Selma channel were probably above \nthe thermocline on at least four out of the 6 sampling occasions and possibly for all 6 sampling occasions . \nNevertheless, the dam levels (dam capacity %) have been included as a variable to account for differences \nin intake depths. An increase in intake depth might limit entrainment of species that may favour surface \nwaters. \nFish were sampled in riverine or impoundment sites adjacent to pumped irrigation infrastructure and the \ndiversion channels so that entrained fish numbers could be referenced against fish abundances in the \nsource water. This is discussed in further detail below. \n \n6 \n \n \nFigure 1: Map of the waterways where pump intakes were located. Sampling was completed along the \nNogoa, Mackenzie and parts of the lower Comet River within the area circled between Emerald and \nBlackwater. Sampling also took place within Fairbairn Dam and in the two diversion channels ex iting from \nFairbairn Dam. Natural flow events originated from upper Theresa Creek and the upper Comet River. \nAllocated flows originated from Fairbairn Dam.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFigure 2: Schematic diagram of different river pump intake types. A: Mid-river channel intake that extends \nseveral metres out from the bank. B: Bankside intake that is close to or flush with the riverbank. C: Intake \nthat draws water from an excavated side channel. Pump outlets run into irrigation channels (as illustrated) or \ndirectly into a ring tank. Note, mid-river channel intakes extend three or more metres from the bank but may \nnot necessarily reach the middle of the river, especially in wider reaches. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFigure 3: Satellite image showing intakes for diversion channels from Fairbairn Dam. Selma Channel intake \n(upper left) when gravity fed, or when pumped into the channel at dam levels below 68% capacity. \nAlternatively, water passes from the intake (lower right) through the bottom of the dam wall to be released \ninto either the Nogoa River, or the Weemah Channel. \nIrrigation outlet sampling \nOutlet netting \nTo monitor irrigation outlets, a custom-made net was set across the outlet channel, 15-20 m downstream of \nthe irrigation pump outlet (Figure 4). Where rock armouring was present on the sides of the channel, the net \nwas positioned immediately downstream of the rocks to prevent it from being snagged or torn. The net was \nconstructed from 4 mm mesh, with two 15 m wings that had a 5 m drop. The top of the wings had a row of \nfloats, and the bottom of each wing contained a lead line. In the centre of the net, betw een the two wings, \nwas a 5 m long 2 mm mesh pocket with a tied cod end. To ensure the bottom of the net did not lift off the \nchannel substrate in the water current, 10 m of 8 mm chain was attached to the lead line across the centre of \nthe net. Additional floats (pool noodles) were added to the float-line in the centre of the net above the pocket \nto ensure the top of the net was not dragged under due to the flow velocity. The net was held in place by \nsteel stakes or alternatively tied to a bull bar of a vehicle (Figure 4). Once the net was secured in the flow, it \nwas drifted backwards until taut. The net was set for 100 min and captured the entire outlet flow for that set \nperiod. After 100 min, the net was carefully hauled in by both wings, ensuring that the lead line remained on \nthe bottom. When the net was almost fully hauled in, the lead line was scooped up to stop fish escaping and \nall the net contents were shaken into the pocket. The cod-end was emptied into aerated bins to be \nprocessed. All captured fish were identified and counted, and the mortality rate for each species was \nestimated. Within each net shot, a maximum of 40 fish from each species were measured (fork length) to \ngive an indication of size-frequency. Catch rates were recorded as catch per 100 min and catches were also \nstandardised to catch per megalitre of water diverted.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFigure 4: Outlet sampling net in place. Note the float line and extra floatation across the centre of the net.  \nLarval netting \nA larval net was also set downstream of the pump outlet for a period of 20-30 min. The duration of a set \ndepended on the current velocity and debris load. Larval nets were made from 200 µm mesh and contained \na fine nylon fabric pocket. The net opening had a diameter of 56 cm and was fitted with a flow meter. By \nusing the start and finish readings from the current meter counter, it was possible to estimate the volume of \nwater that had passed through the larval net during the period it was set. At the end of the set period, the \ncontents of the larval net were emptied into a bucket. Any non-larval fishes were removed from the bucket \nand returned directly to the channel for processing in the larger outlet net sample. The remaining contents \nwere sieved through a plastic jar with 200 µm mesh panels. The contents of the jar were then flushed with \nalcohol, washed into storage jars and diluted with clean water to approximately 60% alcohol content. These \njars were then labelled and stored in a portable refrigerator for later analysis back at the Bribie Island \nResearch Centre laboratory. \nRiver and impoundment sampling \nRiver reaches and Fairbairn Dam were sampled by a combination of boat electrofishing and overnight sets of \nfyke nets. These ‘reference sites’ were sampled to provide an indication of the species composition and \nabundance of fish and fish larvae present in the source waterbody. When reference site catch is compared \nwith outlet catch from nearby irrigation pumps or channel diversions, it can provide an indication of how \nsusceptible different species and different sizes classes of fish may be to entrainment . For example, some \nfish common in the reference site catch may be only rare in the outlet catch, indicating they are not highly \nsusceptible to entrainment or vice-versa. Evaluating abundance of fish at reference sites also allows for \nmore equitable comparisons of the different types of irrigation infrastructure when reference site catch is \nused as a covariate in statistical analyses. \nSampling locations \nReference sites were located as close as possible to pump intakes. The nearest possible access site on the \nriver where an electrofishing boat could be safely launched and operated was used. Sites were used in the \nNogoa, Mackenzie and Comet Rivers, and in Fairbairn Dam. The Fairbairn Dam site was close to the dam \n\n \n10 \n \nwall and the diversion channel intakes. Most reference sites were sampled either on the same day as the \nassociated pump outlet (or outlets) or within one day of outlet sampling, to reflect as closely as possible the \nrelative abundance of fish in that reach of the river during water extraction. On one occasion, sampling at a \nreference site (during data collection for Hutchison et al. 2022) had to be delayed by one week due to \nexceptionally high flow rates leading to safety concerns and road access difficulties.  \nBoat electrofishing \nElectrofishing is an active form of sampling that uses a pulsed DC electric current to stun fish. Anodes are \nset on booms on the front of the boat and lowered to the water during electrofishing (Figure 5), while the \nmetal hull acts as a cathode. An electric field is set up around the boat between the anod es and cathode. \nFish within two to three metres of the boat are temporarily stunned by the current. Stunned fish are dip-\nnetted from the water for identification and measurement. After processing, the fish are released back \nunharmed into the river.  \nFive electrofishing shots were conducted at any given reference site, with each shot consisting of 300 \nseconds of power on time, applied over a 50 m x 15 m area. Most shots were conducted around bankside \nand instream structure, sampling representative habitat for the site.  \n       \nFigure 5: Electrofishing boat in operation on the Mackenzie River. \nFyke netting \nFour fyke nets were set in back-to-back pairs in the late afternoon and cleared the next morning. The fykes \neach had 2 x 5 metre wings, leading to funnels that led into a cod-end. The nets were constructed from 2 \nmm knotless mesh. The entrance to each fyke was fitted with a turtle excluder, consisting of 10 cm wide \nstainless steel wire grills. The turtle excluders prevent large turtles from entering the fyke net and preying on \ntrapped fish. A float was placed in the cod-end of each net to provide an air pocket for air breathing aquatic \nanimals that might pass through the turtle excluder. Fyke nets were set out of the main current in sheltered \nedge areas or backwaters (Figure 6). Fykes are a passive sampling method and rely on fish moving for \nforaging or migration. The wings guide the fish into the net, where they are then trapped in the cod-end by a \nseries of funnels. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFigure 6: A fyke net set along a bank. Note wings leading to an entrance and a float in the cod end to \nprovide an air pocket should any air breathing animals pass the turtle excluder.  \nLarval netting \nIf sufficient current velocity was present, larval nets were set in the river using the same methodology as in \nthe irrigation channels. When flow was slower, larval nets were slowly towed behind the electrofishing boat \nfor 10 min or approximately 600 m. Samples from Fairbairn Dam were always collected by towing. A flow \nmeter set in the mouth of the net enabled calculation of the volume of water sampled. The larval net samples \nwere processed the same way as those from larval nets set in the irrigation channe ls. \nIdentifying larval samples \nIn the laboratory, larvae were viewed through a binocular microscope fitted with a camera linked to a \ncomputer monitor. Larvae were identified to species level where possible using descriptions and images \nfrom the published literature. Those that could not be identified to species level had their size recorded and \nwere photographed for later identification. Newly hatched yolk-sac larvae or damaged larvae were \nsometimes difficult to identify to species level, but most advanced larvae were able to be identifi ed to the \nspecies or family. Fish eggs were also recorded. Without the aid of genetic sampling eggs could not be \nidentified to species, but the size of the eggs can give some indication as to what species groups the eggs \nmay have belonged to. Larval and egg catches were standardised to catch per unit volume sampled. \nData management and susceptibility indices \nData entry and management \nData was entered into an Excel spreadsheet, with tables for shot details, site characteristics, fish catch and \nfish size. Species specific tables were constructed to export the data into Genstat for analyses (see \nstatistical analyses below). Additional tables were established for calculation of susceptibility indices for fish, \nlarval fish and eggs (see methods below). \n\n \n12 \n \nSusceptibility indices \nSusceptibility indices were calculated for each species present in the reference site adjacent to irrigation \ninfrastructure intakes. For larger species, separate indices were calculated for fish ≤100 mm in fork length \nand >100 mm in fork length. The index was calculated from the catch per megalitre entrained through the \ninfrastructure divided by the total catch of that species or size class from the reference site , as collected by \nstandardised electrofishing and fyke netting. For example, if the entrainment  rate for a given fish species and \nsize class was 5 per megalitre and the total catch from the reference site for the same species and size class \nwas 10 fish, then the susceptibility score would be 0.5. If the species was present in the reference site, but \nnot entrained through the infrastructure, then it was given a susceptibility score of zero. Occasionally a \nspecies would be found entrained in the irrigation infrastructure but was not captured in the reference site. \nTo have been entrained through the infrastructure the species must have been present in the reference site, \nso in this scenario the reference site was given a count of 0.5 to enable calculation of an index score. The \narbitrary count of 0.5 was to indicate rarity, but not absence. If for example 5 fish of that species were \nentrained, and none caught in the reference site, then the susceptibility score would have been calculated as \n5/0.5 =10. If a species was not encountered in either the reference site or the outlet site, then no score was \nrecorded for that occasion. As catch per megalitre is generally lower than the standardised river catch, most \nindex values were <1.  The rank order of the indices gives an indication of the relative susceptibility of the \ndifferent species. \nTo calculate susceptibility for fish larvae (or fish eggs) entrained through irrigation infrastructure, the catch of \nfish larvae per cubic metre (m3) was divided by the catch per cubic metre from the reference site. If the \nlarvae of a species were present in the reference site, but not entrained, then a susceptibility score of zero \nwas recorded. If the larvae of a species were entrained, but not detected in the reference site, the river catch \nper cubic metre was designated as 0.01. Note 0.01 larvae per cubic metre is equivalent to 10 larvae per \nmegalitre. This is approximately half of the lowest (non-zero) count recorded for larvae of any species during \nthis project. This figure was to represent presence, but rarity and to enable calculation of a susceptibility \nscore. If the larvae of a species were recorded neither in the irrigation infrastructure nor in the reference site \nduring a sampling event, then no susceptibility score was calculated. Therefore, if the catch of larvae in the \nirrigation infrastructure was 0.06 per cubic metre and the catch rate in the reference site was 0.08 per cubic \nmetre, then the susceptibility score would be 0.06/0.08 =0.75. If the same catch rate was detected in the \ninfrastructure, but no larvae were detected in the river, then the score would be 0.06/0.01 = 6.   \nStatistical analyses \nKey variables analysed \nFor each species and size class (>100mm and ≤100mm) the catch of fish per 100 min of sampling and per \nmegalitre (ML) were evaluated as the dependant variables. The following factors: pump rate (ML pumped \nper day), pump location and depth, and flow type were assessed as explanatory variables. Additional \ncontinuous explanatory variables considered in the statistical analyses were water temperature, turbidity \n(Secchi depth) and conductivity. Pump intake depth was recorded as the depth of the top of the intake pipe \nfrom the surface during normal allocated flow levels and this depth was fixed across all flow types. Intakes \nless than 1 m below the surface were classed as shallow and intakes over 1 m below the surface were \nclassed as deep. The reason for using a fixed rather than a variable depth method is that it is an easier \nvariable to measure for site assessments when collecting information for prioritisation of irrigation \ninfrastructure for mitigation actions. River or impoundment catch of the same species and size class of fish \nwas included as a covariate (Table 2). The same factors and explanatory variables were used for larval fish \nand fish egg entrainment data respectively, but larval river catch and larval entrainment rates were \nexpressed as catch per unit volume sampled only. \n \n  \n \n13 \n \nTable 2: Factors and variables considered for inclusion in statistical models of entrainment through irrigation \ninfrastructure. \nDependent variables \nanalysed \nFactors Continuous explanatory \nvariables \nCovariates \n• Catch per 100 min \n• Catch per ML \n• Pump location and \ndepth \n• Flow type \n• Season \n• Pump rate (outlet \nflow rate) ML per \nday \n• Water temperature \n• Secchi depth \n• Conductivity \n• Impoundment \ncapacity % (for \nSelma and \nWeemah channels \ndata only) \n• River or \nimpoundment \nreference site \nbackground fish \ncatch  \nGeneralised linear models \nGeneralised linear models (GLMs) (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) were used to analyse the catch rate data \nfor adult, juvenile and larval fish in GenStat® (22nd edition, VSN International UK) . A model was generated \nfor each species and size class for which there was sufficient catch data. The Poisson distribution with the \nlog-link function was adopted for catches (discrete counts), with over-dispersion where warranted. The \nNormal distribution with the identity-link function was used for catch rates (catches per ML). Residual plots \nwere used to check the assumptions of homogeneous variances and low skewness. Alternate models were \ntrialled and simplified as appropriate for the somewhat-limited numbers of observations in some analyses. \nThe primary fixed effects were pump location and depth, and flow-type. Season, pump-rate (on a log-basis), \nbackground fish levels at reference sites, temperature, salinity, Secchi-depth and conductivity were also \nconsidered. Season was split into two categories, cool season and warm season. The cool season was \nwinter and early spring when temperatures were 20⁰C or less and the warm season was late spring through \nto autumn when temperatures exceeded 20⁰C. If temperature was run as a variable, season was dropped \nfrom the model. For the diversion channels exiting Fairbairn dam, “dam capacity %” was also considered as \na fixed effect. \nInteractions between the fixed effects were screened but proved to be non-significant. However, dam catch \nrate and dam capacity % were correlated for some species of fish, so these variables were not included in \nthe same model. Adjusted means (and their standard errors) were estimated and subjected to unprotected \npost-hoc pairwise testing with a Fisher’s protected least significant difference test. \nSome species were only recorded infrequently at pump outlets, and some species or size classes that were \nrecorded in the adjacent waterway were never recorded at pump outlets. These fish could not be analysed \nby GLM. However, all species recorded in either adjacent waterways or at irrigation outlets were tabulated. \nModels run for the channels exiting Fairbairn Dam were over-paramatised if both impoundment level and \nbackground fish catch were run in the same model. These were therefore run separately in diff erent models. \nPump our outlet flow rate was dropped for most models for the Fairbairn Dam outlet channels as extremely \nhigh catch rates for some species on one sampling occasion for flow rates of 100 ML per day meant there \nwas no relationship between flow or pump rate for most species, and other parameters were more important \nfor explaining entrainment rates. See the Results section for more details. \nSimilar approaches were used for larval fishes. Model. For larvae entrained from Fairbairn dam, most \nspecies were detected too infrequently for any analyses. A combination of all larvae detected was analysed \nby GLM using a Poisson distribution and Log link function. Terms included in the model included dam \ncapacity, temperature, natural log (ln) of channel inlet flow rate and dam catch of fish larvae as a covariate. \nTemperature was not significant and was dropped from the model. There was some correlation b etween \ndam catch of fish larvae and dam capacity, so these terms were run in alternative models.  \n \n14 \n \nComparison of mean susceptibility indices scores \nSusceptibility indices were designed to enable comparisons between species and size classes, and to adjust \nfor localised species abundances when comparing different infrastructure sizes and configurations. The \nindices can also be used to rank the susceptibility of different species to entrainment. Those species present \nin the river but never entrained received equal low-ranking scores of zero. A species had to be encountered \nin the adjacent river or coming through the pump for it to receive a count for the calculation of “n” for the \nestimation of the mean. The value of “n” refers to the number of occasions a species or size class was \ndetected at a reference site, or if not at the reference site, entrained through a pump adjacent to that \nreference site, as these were occasions when a susceptibility score could be calculated. Absence from both \nthe reference site and pump on a pumping event did not contribute to estimation of the mean value.  Very \nrarely encountered species (n<5) were not included in statistical comparisons of the mean susceptibility \nscores. For those species and size classes with five or more susceptibility scores , analyses were completed \nusing Genstat®. Analyses were by one way ANOVA of Log10 +1 transformed data, followed by a post-hoc \npairwise comparison of the means using a Fisher’s protected least significant difference test. \nResults \nTo make the results more user friendly to the reader, many of the statistical models have been placed in the \nappendices. This section focuses on the key patterns detected and highlights factors or results that were \nstatistically significant. For the GLM outputs, the predicted mean value outputs were presented rather than \nthe tabulated model outputs which can be found in the appendix. Predicted means (also known as adjusted \nmeans) are determined from the actual patterns in the data and hold other factors in the model constant for \nthe prediction. They make it easier to visualise and interpret what the data is showing. \nSpecies caught  \nTable 3 shows the range of species and size classes captured at riverine reference sites and whether these \nspecies and size classes were ever found entrained during the study. Some species and size classes were \nonly rarely detected in the reference sites, so it was to be expected that they may not be detected at \nirrigation outlets. Table 4 shows species and size classes found in the Fairbairn Dam reference site and \nwhether those species or size classes were ever found entrained in the Fairbairn Dam irrigat ion diversion \nchannels. Species for which no size class is indicated are all ≤100 mm in fork length  (for round tailed species \nsuch as gudgeons and juvenile golden perch this measure is equivalent to total length).  \nSpecies or size classes commonly recorded in the river reference sites but not found entrained through \nriverine pumps were saratoga >100 mm, and golden perch ≤ 100 mm. Juvenile golden perch were present in \nrelatively low numbers at riverine reference sites compared to sites the authors have sampled previously in \nthe northern Murray-Darling Basin. Fish entrained during the supplementary data collection period that were \nnot found to be entrained during the original data collection period included golden perch  >100 mm, saratoga \n≤100 mm, barred grunter >100 mm and freshwater catfish ≤100 mm. These fish were not a common catch in \npump outlets in the supplementary data collection period and juvenile freshwater catfish were also rare in the \nriver sites. \nIn contrast to the riverine pumps, golden perch were entrained in both the pumped Selma Diversion Channel \nand the gravity fed Weemah Diversion Channel. Juvenile golden perch were relatively common in Fairbairn \nDam during the original data collection period, with good recruitment evident from an upstream flow event. \nHowever, they were less common in the dam during the supplementary data collection period . \nTable 5 shows detection of fish larvae and fish eggs in irrigation pump outlets and their river reference sites \nand Table 6 shows detection of fish larvae and fish eggs in impoundment diversion channels and the \nFairbairn Dam reference site. Fewer larvae and fish eggs were detected at the impoundment site and the \nassociated diversion channels than were detected in riverine sites and riverine pump outlets. Larvae were \ntypically only seasonal in occurrence, with most larvae being detected in warmer months.  \n \n \n \n15 \n \n \n \n \nTable 3: Fishes (excluding larval stages) recorded either entrained through riverine irrigation pump outlets or \nfrom surveys of the adjacent river reference sites.

On a per unit volume basis, catches ranged from 7.114 fish per ML to 35.37 \nfish/ML, with a mean catch of 13.326 fish per ML. Based on prevailing pumping rates, extrapolated \nentrainment rates per day ranged from 806 to 14,501 fish per day. Larval entrainment rates ranged from 0 to \n128.9 larvae per ML. Based on pumping rates the highest extrapolated daily entrainment of larvae reco rded \nwas 52,849 larvae per day (range 0 to 52,849). \nEntrainment rates in the gravity fed Weemah diversion channel ranged from 237 fish per 100 min sampled to \n4,351 fish per 100 min sampled. On a per unit volume basis catch rates ranged from 27.304 fish per ML to \n626.950 fish per ML, with a mean catch of 143.29 fish per ML. Based on diversion rates, extrapolated \nentrainment rates ranged from 3,413 to 62,695 fish per day. The maximum entrainment rate of larval fish \nrecorded was 38.68 larvae per ML (range 0 to 38.68 larva per ML). Based on prevailing diversion rates, the \nhighest extrapolated daily entrainment rate for fish larvae was 4,641 larvae per day (range 0 to 4,641 larvae \nper day). \nRiverine pumps \nSampled riverine pumps varied considerably in size, with pumping rates ranging from 14 ML per day to 164 \nML per day. Across all riverine pumps, catch rates ranged from 0 fish per 100 min sampled to 793 fish per \n100 min sampled. On a per unit volume basis, catch rates ranged from 0 fish per ML to 137.233 fish per ML, \nwith a mean of 22.658 fish per ML. Extrapolating catch per unit volume figures showed potential daily fish \nentrainment rates through riverine pumps ranging from 0 to 5,794 fish per day. Entrainment rates of larval \nfish through riverine pumps ranged from 0 per ML to 1,028 per ML. Based on daily pumping rates, \nextrapolated daily entrainment rates for fish larvae ranged from 0 to 102,790 fish larvae per day. If fish eggs \nentrained are added to the totals, then combined fish egg and fish larval entrainment rates ranged from 0 per \nML to 2,056 per ML. More detailed breakdowns of entrainment rates by species are provided in the GLM \nresults below. \nGeneralised linear model outputs \nThis section focuses on the predicted (adjusted) means generated by the GLMs and the role of key factors \nand covariates in the models. Tabulated outputs of the various GLM models are in the Appendix.  \nAdult and juvenile fish entrainment in impoundment diversion channels \nIntake type (pumped or gravity fed) \nFor most groups or size classes of fish analysed, intake type was a factor that partially explained variation in \nentrainment rates. Several species and size classes of fish exhibited significant differences in entrainment \nrates per 100 min between the Selma (pumped) Diversion Channel and the Weemah (gravity fed) Diversion \nchannel, with entrainment rates for most species being greater in Weemah Channel  (see Figure 7).  \n \n18 \n \nInstances where mean entrainment rates were higher in the gravity fed Weemah Channel included \nRendahl’s tandan (p<0.05), the combined catch of all fish ≤100 mm (p=0.016), the combined catch of all fish \n(p=0.017), carp gudgeon spp. (p=0.008), bony bream ≤100 mm (p=0.006), barred grunter >100 mm (p< \n0.05).  In the case of barred grunter <100 mm, significantly more fish were captured per 100 min in the \nSelma Channel (p=0.002).  For most other species or size classes no significant differences between the \npumped and gravity fed channel were detected. \n \nFigure 7: Examples of significantly different (P<0.05) entrainment rates per 100 min between pumped and \ngravity fed diversion channels leading from Fairbairn Dam. Entrainment rates are shown for (A) bony bream \n≤100 mm, (B) All fish ≤100 mm, (C) barred grunter ≤100 mm, (D) barred grunter >100 mm, (E) golden perch \n≤100 mm, and (F) carp gudgeon spp. Values shown are adjusted means. Error bars show one standard error \nof the mean. Note vertical scales are different on each graph, and in most cases, values are significantly \nhigher in the gravity fed channel. \n \nPump rate  \nThe influence of pump or diversion flow rate on entrainment rates showed no consistent patterns. A high \nspike in catch rates for several species and size classes in February 2022, when inlet flow rates were 100 \nML per day, meant for most species there was no discernible pattern between pump rate and entrainment \nrate. Therefore, pump or inlet flow rate was dropped as a factor from most models, except for golden perch \n≤100 mm. For this species, a significant correlation (p<0.001) existed between intake or pump flow rate and \nentrainment rate (Figure 8). \n \n\n \n19 \n \n \nFigure 8: Adjusted mean entrainment rates by channel inlet flow rate for golden perch ≤100 mm. Error bars \nshow one standard error of the mean. Means were estimated by holding other factors in the model constant. \nTemperature, dam catch rates and dam capacity (per cent full) \nAs noted above, the pump or inlet flow rate did not explain entrainment rates for most fish in the \nimpoundment diversion channels. For several species or groups of fish, temperature and catch rates in the \nimpoundment (an indicator of fish abundance in the dam) or a combination of both parameters explained \nmuch of the variation. Dam capacity (per cent full) also explained some variation in entrainment rates, but \nthis factor could not be run with the background catch rates in the impoundment due to over -\nparameterisation of the models. Catch rates and dam capacity had some correlation for some species or \ngroups of fish. \nSpecies and groups of fish where temperature was shown to have a significant positive effect included the \ncombined catch of all fish ≤100 mm (p=0.003), combined catch of all fish of all sizes (p=0.003), carp \ngudgeon spp. (p=0.004), flathead gudgeon (p=0.011) and bony bream ≤100 mm (p<0.001) (see Figure 9). \nFor some other species the temperature effect was not statistically significant, but there was still a positive \ntrend for increasing entrainment rates with increasing temperature. This included bony bream  >100 mm. \nOther species such as eastern rainbowfish and barred grunter >100 mm had a no relationship between \nentrainment rates and temperature, whereas golden perch ≤100 mm had a non-significant (p=0.061) \nnegative relationship between the two variables. \nSpecies and groups of fish where the impoundment catch rate covariate had a significant (p<0.05) positive \ninfluence on entrainment rates included bony bream ≤100 mm, flathead gudgeon ≤100 mm, barred grunter \n≤100 mm, barred grunter >100 mm, and golden perch ≤100 mm. For other species and size classes \nabundant enough for the covariate impoundment catch rate to be included in the model, there was no \nsignificant effect, but for most the trend was positive. \n0\n \n \n \n \n10\n1 \n1 \n1 \n  100 1  1 0 1   00      0     00      0     00\n  lden  er h  100 mm entra ned \n er 100 m n\n hannel  nlet     rate\n \n20 \n \n \nFigure 9: Relationship between entrainment rates per 100 min and temperature in diversion channels \nleading from Fairbairn Dam.

Note vertical scales are different on each graph.  \n \nDam capacity was found to have a significant (p<0.05) positive effect on entrainment rates of flathead \ngudgeon (Figure 10), but there was a significant (p<0.05) negative relationship between dam capacity and \nentrainment rate for golden perch ≤100 mm, barred grunter ≤100 mm (Figure 10) and barred grunter >100 \nmm. The relationship between dam capacity and entrainment rates was also negative (but not statistically \nsignificant) for bony bream ≤100 mm and carp gudgeon spp. The relationship between dam capacity and \nentrainment rates for eastern rainbowfish was positive but not statistically significant. Most other \nrelationships between entrainment rates and dam capacity were non-significant with essentially no trends. \n \n \n \nA B\nC D\n \n21 \n \n \nFigure 10: Examples of significant relationships between dam capacity and entrainment rates.

Note vertical scales vary between graphs.  \n \nLarval fish entrainment in impoundment diversion channels \nLarval catches were irregular and infrequent for most species in Fairbairn Dam and impoundment diversion \nchannels. Most species of larvae were detected too infrequently to develop reliable models. Results for \ncombined catches of all larvae are presented below. \nInlet flow rate was found to be significant (p<0.001) with a trend for increasing entrainment rates per day with \nincreasing flow rates (Figure 11). There was no significant difference between the gravity fed Weemah \nChannel and the pumped diversion Selma Channel (p=0.357) but the adjusted mean entrainment rate in the \ngravity fed Weemah Channel was triple that of the pumped Selma Channel. Variability in catch rates was \nhigh, leading to large error bars (Figure 12). Entrained larval numbers were higher when the dam capacity \nwas higher (p=0.004) (Figure 13). The catch rate of larvae in the dam reference site (covariate)  also had a \nsignificant positive effect on larval entrainment rates (p<0.001). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n100\n1 0\n1  0    0    0\n lathead   d e n entra ned \n er 100 m n\n am  a a  ty  \n0\n \n10\n1 \n 0\n  \n 0\n1  0    0    0\n  lden  er h  100 mm entra ned \n er 100 m n\n am  a a  ty  \n0\n0  \n1\n1  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n1  0    0    0\n arred  r nter   100 mm entra ned \n er 100 m n\n am  a a  ty  \nA\nB C\n \n22 \n \n   \nFigure 11: The relationship between impoundment diversion channel pump-inlet flow rate and number of \nlarvae entrained per day.

However, for some species, where appropriate, a normal distribution \nmodel was used. The covariate riverine catch was retained in models if positive in effect, and pump rate was \nretained throughout as natural log (ln) transformed data. Intake location and depth, and flow type were \nretained in all models as factors. Season (warm or cool) was also retained in models for some of the more \ncommonly entrained species and size classes (see original report by Hutchison et al. 2022). Some species \nand size classes entrained (see Table 3) were detected too infrequently to be evaluated by any GLMs at all. \nFor some species with reduced frequencies of capture some simplified GLM models without pump rate were \nrun to see if any trends in the effect of flow type, intake position and depth, and season could be detected.   \nRiverine catch rates had a positive relationship to entrainment rates for blue catfish ≤100 mm, eastern \nrainbowfish, olive perchlet, spangled perch and bony bream ≤100 mm, but it was only significant for \nspangled perch >100mm (P<0.001) and bony bream ≤100 mm (P=0.01).  \nGLMs for fish entrainment per unit volume pumped were also run. Entrainment rates per megalitre generally \nshowed flatter trends than entrainment rates per 100 min, but the overall patterns for the effects of the \ndifferent variables in these models were similar to those for catches per 100 min. However, the focus is on \nfish entrained per 100 min, as this was found to be more useful for detecting trends. The per unit volume \nentrainment models are not presented in this results section, except for modelled entrainment rate per \nmegalitre across all fish and all fish >100 mm. GLM models used to produce the outputs in this results \nsection can be found in the Appendix.  \nPump rate \nPump rate had a significant (P<0.025) positive relationship with the number of species of native fish \nentrained per 100 minutes. For most species, the general trend was for increasing numbers of fish to be \nentrained per 100 minutes as pump rate increased. Although this trend was consistently positive it wasn’t \nsignificant for most species, probably due to variability in catch rates between flow event s. Pump rate had a \nsignificant (P<0.001) positive impact on entrainment rates for eastern rainbowfish and it appears that at \npump rates less than 80 ML/day entrainment of this species is low. Some species, such as spangled perch \nand carp gudgeons, exhibited little change in entrainment rates as pump rates increased. For carp gudgeons \nthe trend was weakly negative.  \nPlots of adjusted mean entrainment rates for the number of native fish species entrained, and adjusted mean \nentrainment rates for various species and size classes of fish are shown in Figure 14.  As noted above, \nentrainment rates per unit volume pumped were just weakly positive as pump rate increased, although for \n0\n1000\n 000\n 000\n 000\n 000\n 000\n 000\n 000\n1  0    0    0\n ar ae entra ned  er day\n am  a a  ty  \n \n24 \n \nfish >100 mm in length the positive trend was more evident.

Other factors in the model were held constant for \nestimation of adjusted means. \nFlow type \nThere was a general trend across most species and size classes of fish for adjusted mean entrainment rates  \nper 100 minutes to have higher values during natural within bank flows than for allocated (supplemental) \nwithin bank flows and natural overbank flows. Entrainment rates were generally lowest on natural overbank \nflows (flood events). Flow type wasn’t always statistically significant, but it was significant for some species \nand size classes. The number of native species of fish entrained was also significantly higher on natural \nwithin bank flow events (P=0.004). \nFlow type was significant when considering all fish entrained (P=0.043). The adjusted mean entrainment rate \nfor all fish during natural within bank flows was approximately double that of the adjusted mean entrainment \nrates during allocated (or supplemental) flow events and nearly eight times the adjusted mean entrainment \nrate of fish during overbank flow events. Flow type was also significant for spangled perch >100 mm \n(P<0.001) and blue catfish (P<0.001), with entrainment being most prevalent on natural within bank flows. \n0\n \n \n \n \n10\n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\ns an led  er h   100 mm  er 100 m n\n  m  rate    day\n0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n100\n1 0\n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n ar    d e n  er 100 m n\n  m  rate     er day\n0\n10\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n l  e  er hlet  er 100 m n\n  m  rate     er day\n0\n10\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0\n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n astern ra n    sh  er 100 m n\n  m  rate     er day\n  \n  \n0\n \n10\n1 \n 0\n  \n 0\n  \n 0\n  \n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n  sh entra ned  er   \n  m  rate     er day\n0\n0  \n1\n1  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n  sh  100 mm entra ned  er   \n  m  rate     er day  \n \n26 \n \nThere were two species (olive perchlet and eastern rainbowfish) where entrainment rates tended to be \nhigher on allocated flows, but not statistically significant. In the case of eastern rainbowfish, the adjusted \nmean entrainment rate was less than 0.5 fish per 100 minutes across all flow types, so the impact was \nrelatively low. Note, other parameters in the model such as pump rate and inlet type were held constant to \nestimate the adjusted means for the different flow types. \nThe adjusted mean entrainment rates per 100 minutes for the number of native species entrained and for \nseveral different species and size classes are presented in Figure 16.  \nInlet location and depth \nInlet location and depth was a significant factor in several of the GLM models. For example it was significant \nfor all species (combined, P <0.05), spangled perch >100 mm (P< 0.001), or carp gudgeon spp. (P=0.005),  \neastern rainbowfish (P=0.002), barred grunter ≤100 mm (P=0.01), blue catfish ≤100 mm (P=0.039) and in \npost-hoc pairwise comparison tests for bony bream >100 mm (P<0.05).  The combined species data also \nincludes the rarer species for which it was not possible to run a GLM. Across most species, even for those \nwhere intake location and depth was not statistically significant, shallow bankside intakes tended to have the \nlowest or one of the lowest two mean entrainment rates (Figure 17). Across all species combined, including \nwhen split by size class, the shallow bankside intakes also showed this trend. There were some species and \nsize classes within species where shallow bankside intakes tended to have higher entrainment rates than \nother inlet and depth combinations. This included eastern rainbowfish (which had very low adjusted mean \nentrainment rates across all intake types), sleepy cod ≤100 mm and blue catfish ≤100 mm. With regard to \nthe number of species entrained per 100 min, shallow bankside intakes also tended to entrain the least \nnumber of species (Figure 17). \n \n \n \n27 \n \n \nFigure 16: Adjusted mean entrainment rates per 100 min for different flow types across different groups of \nspecies and size classes.

The models included the factors ln pump rate, flow type, and inlet \nlocation and depth. Temperature in lieu of season was trialled but was not significant in any model, so was \ndropped. Catches of larvae in the river were run initially as a covariate in the models, but the covariate was \nnever significant and was partly aliased with flow type, so was dropped from the mod els. The final models \ncan be found in the Appendix. \nPump rate \nPump rate was not significant, but there was generally a slight positive trend for increasing numbers of \nlarvae to be entrained per unit time as pump rates increased. Figure 18 shows the trend across all larvae \ncombined. No positive trend was detected for fish eggs with increasing pump size , so pump size was \nexcluded from the model for fish eggs. \n \n\n \n31 \n \n \nFigure 18: Adjusted mean entrainment rates of all larvae combined (larvae per day) by pump (rate ML per \nday). Other factors in the model were held constant to estimate the adjusted means. Error bars show one \nstandard error of the mean. \nFlow type \nEntrainment of fish larvae tended to be greatest on natural within bank flows and least on natural overbank \nflows (Figure19). For species of larvae and larvae combinations for which there were enough data points to \nrun the GLM, flow type was always significant (p<0.05). Golden perch larvae were only ever entrained on \nwithin bank natural flows (P<0.001). In the case of carp gudgeon larvae, entrainment was more prevalent on \nwithin bank allocated flows and this was statistically significant (P=0.011). Fish egg entrainment was most \nlikely to occur on natural flow events, especially during within-bank natural flows. Eggs tended to be >2 mm \nin diameter and pelagic. Eggs were least likely to be recorded on allocated (supplemental) flow events \n(Figure19). \nIntake position and depth \nIntake position and depth showed similar patterns for entrainment rates to those for non -larval fishes (Figure \n20). The bankside shallow intakes generally had the lowest or second lowest entrainment rates. This was \nstatistically significant for golden perch larvae (P<0.05). Pelagic fish eggs showed a different pattern, with \nentrainment rates tending to be higher in bankside deep and bankside shallow intakes compared to the other \nintakes (P<0.05).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n 000\n 000\n 000\n 000\n10000\n1 000\n1 000\n1 000\n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 100 110 1 0 1 0 1 0\n  m  ned lar ae entra ned  er day\n  m  rate     er day\n \n32 \n \n \nFigure 19: Adjusted daily mean entrainment rates of fish larvae and fish eggs for different flow types.

Numerous lower ranked species and size \nclasses were not significantly different to each other. Several species and size classes were detected or \nentrained too infrequently for statistical analyses. Rankings of all species and size classes by their me an \nsusceptibility score are shown in Table 7. However, for those species caught too infrequently for statistical \nanalyses, their position in the rankings needs to be treated with considerable caution, as it could change up \nor down with further detections. \nLarval fish were found too infrequently in the diversion channels for any statistical comparisons to be made. \nOnly bony bream larvae were sampled on at least five occasions in the channels. The mean susceptibility \nscore for bony bream larvae was 6.397, for flathead gudgeon larvae it was 0.699, for sleepy cod larvae it \nwas 0.340 and for carp gudgeon larvae it was 0. Carp gudgeon larvae were detected in the dam, but never \nin the channels when present in the dam.

This current study combines data from the work \nby Hutchison et al. (2022) and data collected in 2023-24. This combination of data has enabled comparison \nof entrainment rates through multiple irrigation intake types to develop generalisations which can be used to \nprioritise where mitigation measures should be undertaken. Not all the previous studies in Australia directly \nquantified rates of entrainment, but of those that did, Norris et al. (2015) found maximum entrainment rates \nof 3,293 fish per ML (94,838 per day) through a pumped diversion on Oakey Creek in the Condamine \ncatchment, whilst Baumgartner et al. (2009) recorded a maximum entrainment rate of only 232 fish per day \nthrough a pumped diversion. Some of the variation between these past studies is probably due to factors \nsuch as the local abundance of fish in the river system, the diversion type, position and depth of the intake, \npumping rate and the flow event type being monitored. The current project recorded entrainment rates \nthrough riverine pumps ranging from 0 fish/ML to 137.23 fish/ML equating to 0 to 5,794 fish per day. In a \npumped diversion from an impoundment this study recorded entrainment rates of 7.11 fish/ML to 35.37 \nfish/ML (806 to 14,501 fish per day). The impoundment diversion pumped at a considerably higher maximum \nrate (420 ML/day) than any of the riverine pumps examined (maximum 164 ML/day) but still had a lower \nmaximum rate of entrainment than the riverine pumps.  \nIn the current study the highest entrainment rates were recorded in the gravity fed Weemah irrigation \nchannel. Entrainment rates ranged from 27.30 fish/ML to 626.95 fish/ML. Extrapolated entrainment rates \nranged from 3,413 to 62,695 fish per day. O’Connor et al. (2008) also monitored a gravity fed diversion, and \nalthough they did not but did not quantify entrainment rates per unit time or per unit volume, electrofishing \nsurveys indicated high abundance of native and introduced fish species in the diversion channel . Jones and \nStuart (2008) have also indicated that gravity fed diversions can entrain high numbers of fish .  \n \n37 \n \nIt appears that non-larval fish are more susceptible to entrainment through gravity fed diversions, than \nthrough pumped diversions, although it should be noted this study only compared one gravity fed diversion \nwith an adjacent pumped diversion. Gravity fed diversions should probably be a high priority for mitigation, \nbut it would be worth doing more research comparing gravity fed with pumped diversions in other river \nbasins, especially where both pumped, and gravity fed diversions share the same river chan nel. Pumped \ndiversions can subsequently be prioritised based on criteria developed in this study. Gravity fed diversions \nand prioritisation of pumped diversions will be elaborated on further in sections below.  \nLarval fish \nLarval fish and fish eggs were detected far more intermittently than non-larval fish. This is to be expected as \nfish spawning tends to be cued by various environmental factors, including temperature, flow, and day length \n(King et al. 2016, Lintermans 2023, Šmejkal et al. 2023), thus larvae and fish eggs are present in the \necosystem intermittently. Therefore, entrainment rates of zero were frequently recorded in riverine pumped \ndiversions, in an impoundment pumped diversion and, in an impoundment,-based gravity diversion. The \nmaximum entrainment rate recorded from the pumped diversion from Fairbairn Dam into the Selma c hannel \nwas 128.9 larvae/ML and the maximum daily entrainment rate was estimated to be 52,849 larvae per day. \nThe maximum entrainment rate recorded in the gravity fed Weemah diversion channel was 38.68 larvae  per \nML Based on prevailing diversion rates the highest extrapolated daily entrainment rate for fish larvae was \n4,641 larvae per day. The maximum larval entrainment rate was therefore recorded from a pumped, rather \nthan gravity fed diversion. However, occurrence of fish larvae and fish eggs in the Fairbairn Dam was \nirregular. More frequent sampling for larvae across the year is probably required to detect irruptions of larvae \nand develop a more informative indication of trends in entrainment of fish eggs and fish larvae. Such an \nundertaking would be time consuming and therefore expensive. \nThe maximum recorded rate of larval fish through riverine pumps was 1,028 larvae per ML, generating a \ndaily maximum extrapolated entrainment rate of 102,790 larvae per day. If fish eggs entrained are added to \nthe totals, then the maximum combined fish egg and fish larval entrainment rate was 2,056 per ML. Pelagic \neggs and larvae drift on flow events. Thus, it is not surprising that riverine pumps had a higher maximum \nlarval entrainment rate than pumped and gravity diversions from Fairbairn Dam. The general lack of currents \nin the Fairbairn Dam would require active swimming by larvae or wind generated water movements to put \nlarvae in proximity of irrigation inlets. Spawning events for most species tend to occur in the warmer months \nof the year, which is often the time when demands for water for irrigation are also at their highest . It is \ntherefore likely that some riverine pumping events will coincide with pulses of larvae. The maximum recorded \nloss of 102,790 larvae from the river through one pump on a single day does not equate to the loss of \n102,790 mature fish, because larval mortalities are naturally high for many species, but even if just 1% of \nlarvae made it through to the adult stage, then the loss of so many larvae would equate to the loss of over \n1,000 adult fish, and if survival is just 0.1% from larvae to adult, then the loss of so many fish from the river \nequates to 100 adult fish per day through a single pump. Fortunately, modern self-cleaning fish screens can \nsubstantially reduce loss of fish larvae (Stocks et al. 2024).   \nSpecies entrained \nCompared with the findings of Hutchison et al. (2022), some additional species and size classes were \nrecorded to be entrained through riverine pumps in the current project. This included golden perch >100 mm, \nsaratoga ≤100 mm, barred grunter >100 mm and freshwater catfish ≤100 mm.  These fish were not a \ncommon catch in pump outlets in the supplementary data collection period and juvenile freshwater catfish \nwere also rare in the river sites. Juvenile saratoga were not captured in the river during the origina l sampling \nfor this project, but small numbers were found in the 2023-2024 sampling period. This probably explains why \nthey were only recently detected being entrained through riverine pumps. Adult saratoga have been detected \nat riverine sites throughout both periods of this project but have not yet been found entrained. Despite \ndetecting golden perch >100 mm being entrained through riverine pumps; this project did not detect any \nentrainment of juvenile golden perch through the same pumps. This is possibly due to the relatively low \nabundance of golden perch fingerlings in the adjacent river, which suggests recent recruitment has been \npoor. Larval golden perch were detected on some flow events in 2021-2022 and pelagic eggs (possibly \ngolden perch eggs) were also detected in both stages of the project, both in the river and entrained through \npumps. Hutchison et al. (2022), found juvenile golden perch were entrained through offtakes from Fairbairn \n \n38 \n \nDam. This coincided with high numbers of juvenile golden perch in Fairbairn Dam in the first phase of this \nproject.   \nThe detection of juvenile freshwater catfish entrained through a riverine pump is significant. Only adults of \nthis species were detected in the river, suggesting juvenile freshwater catfish were in low abundance. This \nspecies is threatened in the Murray-Darling Basin (Lintermans 2023). Juvenile catfish have also been found \nto be entrained through pumps in the Condamine catchment (Norris 2015, Norris et al. 2020). Olive perchlet \nand purple spotted gudgeon were also entrained through riverine pumps across bot h phases of this project \nand these species are also threatened in the Murray Darling Basin (Lintermans 2023).  Additionally, olive \nperchlet were detected for the first time below outlets from Fairbairn Dam, although entrainment of this \nspecies through the dam diversion channels was less frequent than through riverine pumps. \nSome fish present in dam or river sites were not observed to be entrained. This included freshwater long \ntom, Murray cod, adult saratoga and barramundi. Freshwater longtom and adult saratoga are both surface \nspecies and this behaviour may keep them away from most riverine pump intakes . The smallest Murray cod \nsampled in reference sites were beyond fingerling size, and no fingerling size barramundi were detected in \nreference sites during sampling. Most barramundi detected were large fish. None of our sampling events \ncoincided with recent releases of stocked barramundi fingerlings. The juvenile stages of both Murray cod and \nbarramundi can be expected to be more vulnerable to entrainment. Experiments and sampling in the Murray-\nDarling Basin have shown that juvenile Murray cod can be vulnerable to entrainment (O’Connor et al. 2008, \nStocks et al. 2024).   \nThe diversity of larval fish species found entrained in both riverine and impoundment offtakes is relatively low \n(Tables 5 and 6) compared to the range of non-larval species entrained (Tables 3 and 4). This probably in \npart reflects the smaller windows of time that fish larvae are in the system. The range of species of larvae \nentrained was higher in the riverine pumps than in the impoundment diversions. This is most likely because \nlarvae are washed past pump intakes during flow events in a riverine environm ent, whereas in the \nimpoundment, where there are generally no currents, larvae would need to actively swim past intakes or be \nmoved there by wind generated currents when the wind is blowing in the right direction. A greater diversity of \nlarvae was also detected in riverine reference sites compared to Fairbairn Dam and some species of larvae \ndetected in the river sites were not recorded being entrained. \nFactors influencing entrainment rates \nDiversion type \nHutchison et al. (2022) noted that the pumped Selma diversion and the gravity fed Weemah, diversion \noriginating from the same water body, consistently showed less fish in total being entrained through the \npumped diversion than the gravity fed diversion. This trend continued with the addition of supplementary \ndata. For the combined totals of all fish species and for all fish ≤100 mm this was statistically significant \n(P<0.05). This trend was also statistically significant for several small bodied species and for smaller size \nclasses of several species. The one exception was barred grunter ≤100 mm, which were entrained at a \nsignificantly higher rate per unit time into the pumped diversion. In the case of fish for which there were no \nstatistically significant differences, the trend was generally for the adjusted mean value to be higher for fish \nentrained through the gravity fed diversion. Entrainment rates of larger fish in impoundment diversions were \ngenerally much lower, suggesting these fish may be better at avoiding entrainment. As noted by Hutchison et \nal. (2022) some of the differences between the two diversions might be explained by the rocky channel \nleading to the Selma intake, compared to the more open water around the Weemah intake. The rocks \npotentially could offer refugia from the intake current. However, the Selma inta ke channel was a highly \nproductive area for sampling fish by electrofishing both in phases one and two of this project, suggesting fish \nwere numerous near the intake point. Even when the water extraction rates were much higher in the Selma \nChannel than in the Weemah Channel, the Weemah Channel entrained more fish per unit time. Pump noise \nmight deter some fish from approaching the Selma intake, whereas the gravity fed Weemah diversion would \nonly have natural sounds related to flow akin to that of a natural entrance to an anabranch or a cascade. As \nnoted in the original report (Hutchison et al. 2022), the sampling location in the Selma channel had to be set \nbelow a section of rock lined channel for safety and logistical reasons. It is possible that some entra ined fish \ninjured or killed passing through the Selma pump may have settled in rock crevices before reaching the \nsampling net and this may have biased catch rates downwards. Adjusted mean entrainment rates for larvae \n(all larvae combined) was three times higher in the gravity fed Weemah channel than in the pump fed Selma \n \n39 \n \nchannel. Although not statistically significant, due to high variability in catch rates between events, this trend \nis consistent with that for most of the non-larval fishes sampled.  \nWhilst not originating from the same waterbody as the Weemah Channel, at comparable intake flow rates, \nthe riverine pumps monitored in this study generally had lower entrainment rates per volume of water \npumped compared to the Weemah Channel. This suggests gravity fed diversions may be a higher priority for \nmitigating fish entrainment. Comparative studies of other pumped and gravity fed diversions, especially \ngravity fed diversions leaving from river channels are required to support this concept.  \nOther researchers have also suggested that gravity fed diversions leading off rivers have the potential to \nentrain large numbers of fish (e.g., Jones and Stuart 2008; O’Connor et al. 2008). Fish are known to make \ndownstream migrations (e.g. O’Connor et al. 2003, Hutchison et al. 2008,). In coastal rivers this includes \ncatadromous species of fish like Australian bass, sea mullet and barramundi (Allen et al. 2002). Juvenile fish \nhave been shown to make downstream movements in the Murray-Darling Basin, and adult fish after heading \nupstream on rising flows often head back downstream on falling flows (Hutchison et al. 2008). It is plausible \nthat these fish could swim downstream into a diversion channel. In these situations, downstream migrating \nfish, including juveniles and drifting larvae would be highly susceptible to entrainment in gravity fed \ndiversions (Boys et al. 2021), which would behave much like an anabranch channel and therefore potentially \ndivert many fish from the river.  \nIt would be informative to see if entrainment rates are increased in the Selma Channel when it operates as a \ngravity fed diversion during higher lake levels but unfortunately dam levels did not reach the critical level of \n60% capacity during this study. \nDam capacity \nDuring the original phase of this project the level of Fairbairn Dam ranged from 14% to 26% and when \ncollecting the supplementary data, it ranged from 35% to 42%. As the increased depth would alter the depth \nof the intakes, dam capacity (used as a substitute for depth) was tested as a factor in the GLM models for \nentrainment rates through the channel inlets. Our hypothesis was that if the intake was located below the \nthermocline in a hypoxic layer of water, then entrainment rates would be low due to the abs ence of fish in the \nzone from which water was drawn. However, the results suggest that neither intake was below the \nthermocline during the extended study period, as fish continued to be entrained through both inlets.  \nDam capacity explained some variation in entrainment rates of non-larval fishes but was partially aliased with \ndam catch rates of various size classes and species of fish. Therefore, it is difficult to draw any conclusions \non the direct influence of dam level. Similarly for entrainment rates of larval fish, dam capacity  seemed to \nhave an influence on entrainment rates. The catch rates of fish larvae from the dam were also positively \ncorrelated with the dam capacity and larval entrainment rates were higher when the dam capacity was \nhigher. It seems likely that dam capacity may have had an indirect influence on entrainment rates by \ninfluencing the abundance or density of fish in the dam. Higher water levels may have favoured recruitment \nof some species (e.g. flathead gudgeon), leading to increased entrainment rates, or led to production of \nlarvae which increased their entrainment rates. However, for some species of fish (e.g. golden perch ≤100 \nmm and barred grunter ≤100 mm), increases in dam levels led to decreases in entrainment. This could \npossibly have been due to the dilution effect of the increased volume of water in the dam, or alternatively as \nthe intakes became deeper below the surface, they may have entered a zone these fish did not occupy as \nfrequently. \nTemperature \nWithin the diversion channels exiting from Fairbairn Dam, temperature was shown to have a significant \npositive effect on the entrainment rates of various non larval fishes. These included the combined catch of all \nfish, combined catch of all fish ≤100 mm, carp gudgeon spp., flathead gudgeon and bony bream ≤100 mm. \nFor some other species the temperature effect was not statistically significant, but a positive trend for \nincreasing entrainment rates with increasing temperature was present. Golden perch ≤100 mm exhibited a \nnon-significant negative relationship between temperature and entrainment rates.  \nIn general, as temperatures increase, feeding activity levels and metabolic rates of fish tend to increase, \nalthough there is a point where temperatures can become too high, and fish become stressed (Volkoff and \nRønnestad 2020). Dissolved oxygen levels also decline with increasing temperatures. As the Fitzroy \n \n40 \n \ncatchment occupies the tropics and sub-tropics, most species of native fish in the system would be well \nadapted to warm waters. Therefore, it can be expected that most fish in this catchment would be more active \nin the warmer months of the year. Increased activity levels are more likely to lead to increased probability of \ninteraction with irrigation intakes, and therefore entrainment rates can be expected to be higher when waters \nare warm. In static waters such as Fairbairn Dam, activity levels of fish activated by temperature are \nprobably more significant for bringing fish into contact with an intake, compared to within a river, where cues \nsuch as flow may trigger movements provided temperatures are above a critical threshold, and where flows \ncan result in passive movements of larval fish, fish eggs and small juveniles through downstream drift.  \nFor non-larval fishes, no significant effect of season on entrainment rates through riverine pumps was \ndetected for any of the size classes or species for which this factor was run in GLMs. However, most \npumping events were sampled in the warmer months of the year, as this tended to be the peak irrigation time \nfor cotton. Thus, it is possible that under-representation of cool season events may have masked any trends. \nTemperature was also not found to be significant for entrainment of fish larvae through riv erine pumps. \nAgain, this is probably the result of too few samples being collected in the cooler months. Most native \nlowland non-diadromous species of fish in Australia tend to spawn in the warmer months (spring -summer). \nTherefore, it would be expected that entrainment of larvae should be higher in the warmer times of the year. \nA combination of too few cool season samples and only patchy spawning events in the warmer months \n(resulting in some zero entrainment results) could mask the importance of temperatur e or season for rates of \nentrainment of larval fish in a river system. \nReference site catch rates \nThe catch rate of larvae in the dam reference site was significantly correlated with larval entrainment rates. \nIncreased density of larvae in the dam increased the probability of larvae being entrained in the Selma and \nWeemah Channels. Similar trends occurred for non-larval fishes in Fairbairn Dam. Species and groups of \nfish where the covariate impoundment catch rate had a significant positive influence on entrainment rates \nincluded bony bream ≤100 mm, flathead gudgeon ≤100 mm, barred grunter ≤100 mm, barred grunter >100 \nmm, and golden perch ≤100 mm. For other species there was no significant effect, but for most the trend \nwas still positive.  \nRiverine catch rates had a positive relationship to entrainment rates for blue catfish ≤100 mm, eastern \nrainbowfish, olive perchlet, spangled perch and bony bream ≤100 mm, but it was only significant for \nspangled perch >100mm and bony bream ≤100 mm). For most other fish there was no apparent relationship \nbetween catch in the riverine reference site and entrainment rates. The reason for this is uncertain. One \npossibility is that the riverine sampling methods used may not have adequately detected certain spec ies. Our \nfyke nets were generally set in less than one metre depth and electrofishing is usually not very effective in \ndepths greater than two to three metres, especially in turbid waters. Thus, relative abundance of some \nspecies occupying deeper waters may have been an underestimated. There also could be behavioural \ndifferences driving these changes in entrainment rates. For example, some species may be in low \nabundance, but their behaviour in a riverine environment, may make them more likely to approach an \nirrigation inlet. Other species, although quite abundant may have behavioural traits that make them less \nlikely to approach intakes and thus be entrained, Behaviour within species groups and size classes may also \nvary seasonally or with various environmental factors, so this could potentially break down relationships \nbetween abundance in the river and entrainment rates. \nPump rate \nImpoundment diversion channels \nFor both the pumped and gravity fed diversions originating from Fairbairn Dam, pump rate (or gravity fed \nextraction rate) was not always positively correlated with entrainment rate. There were some instances of \nnegative relationships. It is likely that factors other than pump rate were contributing more strongly to the \nentrainment of fish. Water temperature, dam level and abundance of fish in the reference site have all been \ndemonstrated to influence entrainment rates, and for many species and size classes in the impoundment this \nmay have had a greater influence than the water extraction rate. Golden perch ≤100 mm were an exception \nto this trend and there was a significant correlation between intake or pump flow rate and entrainment rate \nfor this species. \n \n41 \n \nInlet flow rate was found to be significantly correlated with larval fish entrainment rates into the channels \nleading from Fairbairn Dam. The trend was for increasing entrainment rates per day with increasing flow \nrates. Given larval fish have poor swimming abilities, if larvae are within the proximity of an irrigation inlet, \nthey are highly likely to be entrained. Thus, for a static waterbody like Fairbairn Dam, provided larvae are \npresent in the dam, as intake flow rates increase, the number of larvae entrained per unit time can also be \nexpected to increase.  \nRiverine pumps \nFor many species and size classes of fish, there was a positive relationship between fish entrained per unit \ntime and pump rates. However, for most fish this was not statistically significant. Pump rate had a significant \npositive effect on the number of different species entrained per unit time and for the number of eastern \nrainbowfish entrained per unit time.  For some species of fish, there was no relationship, or it was weakly \nnegative. For those species with very weak trends, other factors must be influencing entrainment rates to \nbreak down the relationship between pump rate and entrainment. Some of these factors were discussed in \nthe original report for this project (Hutchison et al. 2022) and included the possibility that some species may \nactively swim into intakes. Other species may also be very good at avoiding intakes. \nWhen entrainment rates were considered per unit volume of water pumped, a weak positive relationship was \nevident for many individual species of fish and overall, when they were pooled. This suggests that the \nnumber of fish entrained per megalitre only increases slowly as pump rates increase. The trend was a little \nstronger for larger size classes (fish >100 mm) of fish. Entrainment patterns suggested larger fish were \ngenerally capable of avoiding entrainment at lesser pumping rates but become more likely to be entrained at \nhigher pumping rates.   \nPooled data for all riverine larvae showed a weak positive (but not statistically significant) relationship \nbetween entrainment rates per unit time and pump rate. For fish eggs, no relationship was detected. This \nwas unexpected. For eggs and larvae which can be expected to drift passively on river flows, you would \nnormally expect a positive relationship between pump rate and entrainment rate per unit time. There must be \nother factors at play in the river which have reduced the intensity of this relationship.  The sporadic nature of \nlarval entrainment, which is linked to timing of spawning events, probably meant there was less statistical \npower to demonstrate the effect of pump rate on this life history stage.  \nOverall, when pooling data for all species, and considering the weak positive relationship between fish larvae \nentrainment and pump rates, it seems that pumping rate does have an influence on entrainment rates, but \nthe impact of pumping rate may be less important than other factors and this needs to be considered when \napplying weightings to a prioritisation matrix. \nFor most species entrainment rates per unit volume of water pumped increased only marginally with \nincreasing pump rate. Generally, farms with larger pumps have larger storages and are therefore likely to \npump greater total volumes of water. Given entrainment rates increase per unit time as pumping rates \nincrease, it can be expected that the total number of fish entrained will be greater on farms with larger \npumps, although intake position and depth, and flow type may have a greater influence on the total number \nof fish entrained than pump rate (see below). \nFlow type \nFlow type was statistically significant for several species, including the pooled entrainment catch across all \nspecies and size classes. It was quite clear from the results that fish and larvae are less likely to be \nentrained through riverine pumps on overbank flow events. This trend for low catches on overbank flows was \nconsistent across multiple species and size classes, providing some confidence that the effect is real.  \nEntrainment rates as low as zero fish per 100 min were recorded on some overbank even ts.  Fewer species \nwere likely to be entrained on overbank flow events. Variability in catch rate was low on overbank flows, but \nthe considerable variability in entrainments rates with the other flow types made it difficult to show a \nstatistically significant difference across all species.  \nThere could be at least two reasons for reduced entrainment rates on overbank flows. Firstly, the greater \nvolume of water on overbank flows compared to within bank flows means that the density of fish per unit \nvolume of water would be reduced. Secondly, during overbank flows it is likely that most fish will avoid the \nstrong currents of the main river channel and will be sheltering or moving through the quieter water on the \nvegetated margins, which would be located behind or well above any riverine irrigatio n intake. On overbank \n \n42 \n \nflows our fykes were set in these areas and they caught good numbers of fish.  It is unlikely that irrigators \nextract water from rivers solely on overbank flows. However, if they do extract water when the flow is over \nthe riverbank (i.e., during flood flows), then this activity will have low direct impact on fish through \nentrainment. \nPrior to this work it was expected that more non-larval fish would be entrained on within bank natural flow \nevents than on allocated flow events. Previous work by Hutchison et al. (2008) found that most non-larval \nfish were more likely to move up or downstream during natural flow events than during allocated flow events. \nMurray-Darling rainbowfish were an exception to this rule. Therefore, it would be expected that most non-\nlarval fish could be more vulnerable to entrainment during natural within bank flows. Analyses using the \nadditional data collected now confirm that expectation. In the original study by Hutchison et al. (2022), within-\nbank natural flows were only marginally higher in adjusted mean entrainment rates than within bank \nallocated flow entrainment rates. However, the addition of extra data has demonstrated that entrainment on \naverage is twice as likely on within-bank natural flow events than it is on within bank allocated flow events. \nThis trend was reversed for eastern rainbowfish, which were much more likely to be entrained on allocated \nflow events than natural flow events. This result aligns with the observations of Hutchison et al. (2008) for \nMurray-Darling rainbowfish. Olive perchlet had a similar pattern to eastern rainbowfish, although variability \nwas very high for olive perchlet. \nOlive perchet, although still relatively common in coastal catchments, has declined significantly in the \nMurray-Darling Basin and is absent from large parts of its former range (Lintermans 2009) . Based on these \nresults their recovery could be at risk from pumping on allocated flows in parts of the Murray-Darling Basin \nwhile pumps remain unscreened. There was a tendency for fish of various species greater than 100 mm in \nlength to be entrained more readily on natural within bank flow events than on allocated flow events. This \nincluded spangled perch and bony bream. It is possible that some of these fish could have been undertaking \nmovements related to spawning when entrained. From a biological perspective, entrainment of fish \nundertaking spawning movements could be considered more significant than entrainment of juveniles.  \nData for fish larvae and eggs generally matched the trend for non-larval fishes. Golden perch larvae were \nonly entrained on natural within bank flow events. Golden perch are known to spawn on natural flow events \nbut have also been recorded breeding on environmental flow releases (Stuart and Sharpe 2020). Their \nbuoyant eggs and larvae then drift downstream (Stuart and Sharpe 2020) and at this stage they would be \nhighly vulnerable to entrainment. Golden perch are of significant social and economic value. Entrained \npelagic eggs were most prevalent on natural within bank flows. Of the more commonly entrained larvae, only \ncarp gudgeon spp. larvae were entrained more frequently of allocated flow events. Carp gudgeon guard and \nfan their eggs (Lintermans 2023), so spawning is most likely to occur in low flow periods, which would \nexplain why carp gudgeon larvae are more prevalent on allocated flow events, than during natural flow \nevents. \nIt appears that flow type is more significant than pumping rate and that pumping on overbank flows has little \ndirect impact on fish via entrainments. Overall, entrainment rates are approximately doubled (across all \nspecies pooled) when pumping from natural-within-bank flows, compared to pumping from allocated within-\nbank flows. \nIntake position and depth \nThe current work (including that by Hutchison et al. 2022) is the first to look in detail at the effect of riverine \npump intake position and depth on entrainment rates. Previous work by Norris et al. (2015) monitored two \npumps of similar capacity on opposite banks of the same river reach. Catch rates varied considerably \nbetween the two intakes. Comparison of intake position and depth was not the objective of Norris et al. \n(2015) but the observations did suggest that intake position and depth might have an influence on \nentrainment rates.  \nThe current study strongly supports the concept that intake position and depth can influence entrainment \nrates. With the addition of the supplementary data from this project’s extension, the general trends observed \nfor pump intake position have remained consistent with the original findings . However, with the additional \ndata several more species, size classes or species combinations were found to be statistically significant for \nthis factor. For example, it was significant for all species (combined) entrained, for spangled perch >100 mm, \nfor carp gudgeon spp., eastern rainbowfish, barred grunter ≤100 mm, blue catfish ≤100 mm and it was also \n \n43 \n \nsignificant in post-hoc pairwise comparison tests for bony bream >100 mm. The combined species data also \nincludes the rarer species for which it was not possible to run a GLM model.  \nThere were some exceptions to the overall trend for less entrainment through bankside shallow intakes. For \nexample, eastern rainbowfish were significantly more likely to be entrained through shallow bankside intakes \nthan other intakes. Sleepy cod ≤100 mm and blue catfish ≤100 mm also tended to be entrained more \nfrequently through bankside shallow intakes, but entrainment rates of these species were relatively low. On \nbalance, shallow bankside intakes have the lowest risk of entraining native fish.  \nThe trend for relatively low entrainment rates through bankside shallow intakes was also reflected in the data \nfor larval fishes, but pelagic fish eggs had higher adjusted mean entrainment rates through bankside shallow \nand bankside deep intakes. \nThe differences between the other intakes varied between species. Considering all species and size classes \npooled, there was little difference between the other three intake types.  \nMost of these differences in entrainment rate between intake types are probably related to behavioural traits \nof the different species of fish, which would determine how likely they are to encounter the location of a \nparticular intake type. For example, the higher entrainment rates of olive perchlets from mid-river channel \nintakes, suggests that during flow events that a significant number of olive perchlets are likely to be moving \nmid-river channel, perhaps migrating with the flow. The high prevalence of spangled perch >100 mm in \nbankside deep intakes and mid-river channel deep intakes, suggests that adult spangled perch may migrate \nduring within bank flow events reasonably deep in the water column. The prevalence of bony bream \nentrainment through side channel intakes may indicate bony bream seeking shelter from the river currents.  \nSusceptibility of different species and size classes to entrainment \nAs the susceptibility index was calculated from a relationship between the number of fish entrained per \nmegalitre and the number of fish of the same species and size class captured by standardised sampling in \nthe river or impoundment reference site, it could be prone to some biasing by the catchability of that species \nor size class by electrofishing and fyke netting. In general, the combination of electrofishing and fyke netting \nshould give a reasonable estimate of relative abundance, but it is still possib le that some fish species may be \nover or under-represented by these sampling methods.  \nIf the standardised sampling methods give reasonable representation of relative abundance, then within the \nirrigation channels exiting Fairbairn Dam, Flat-headed gudgeon, carp gudgeon spp, bony bream ≤100 mm \nand golden perch ≤100 mm appear to be the most vulnerable to entrainment. These represent small species \nof fish or small size classes of larger fish. Thus, some of their vulnerability may be due to swimming ability. \nSmaller fish may have more difficulty avoiding the approach velocities within the vicinity of pumps (Boys et \nal. 2013). This result is closely aligned to the result reported by Hutchison et al. (2022). Most other species \nand size classes were not significantly different to each other, although some fish species or size classes \nwere sampled too infrequently to be included in the statistical analysis.  \nFor riverine pumps, olive perchlet, spangled perch >100 mm and spangled perch ≤100 mm appear to be the \nmost vulnerable to entrainment. All other species and size classes sampled frequently enough for statistical \nanalyses were not significantly different to each other. It is possible that these fish were entrained at high \nrates relative to their abundance because of migratory behaviour. Both species are known to move laterally \ninto wetlands during flow events (Hutchison et al. 2008).  Entrained olive perchlets and spangled perch were \nalso found to have a significantly different size distribution to fish captured in adjacent riverine reference sites \n(Hutchison et al. 2022). This suggests that these fish could be mature fish undergoing a spawning migration. \nTheir migratory behaviour on flow events may make them more vulnerable to entrainment in a riverine \nsituation. As olive perchlet are threatened in the Murray-Darling Basin, entrainment during a spawning \nmigration could impact on recovery of this species. \nLarval fish entrained in irrigation channels exiting Fairbairn Dam were encountered too infrequently to \nwarrant any discussion. Within riverine offtakes, unidentified larvae were the most vulnerable to entrainment. \nMostly these larvae were early-stage larvae, which is why identification was difficult. Early-stage larvae are \nlikely to be poorer swimmers than more advanced larvae, which may explain why they are entrained more \nfrequently. \n \n44 \n \nPrioritising mitigation \nThe evidence from this study suggests that gravity fed diversions could have a higher impact than pumped \ndiversions. Based on this current work and some observations published in the literature, gravity fed \ndiversions are likely to be a high priority for mitigation actions in a catchment.  Further studies in catchments \nwhere gravity fed diversions are more prevalent are required to compare entrainment rates between pumped \nand gravity fed diversions to confirm this. Depending on the size of the gravity fed diversion, they could be \nscreened with a bank of cone screens or by a large vertical panel, self-cleaning wedge wire screen \nincorporating a bypass channel back to the river as is commonly done in the USA. Screening gravity fed \ndiversions may be very expensive, but as these diversions generally service multiple irrigators , the cost per \nindividual user may not be that high. For example, in the Emerald irrigation district, it is not just cotton \ngrowers who are serviced by a gravity fed diversion, but also citrus, grape and cereal producers. \nAlternatively, government grants may be able to fund or subsidise some mitigation projects. \nPumped diversions also have significant impacts on fish, but the impact is highly variable. Combining the \ndata from Hutchison et al. (2022) with the supplementary data from the current study, an evidence-based \nprioritisation matrix has been developed that can help community groups, NRM groups, government \nagencies and irrigators prioritise mitigation of pumped irrigation infrastructure within a catchment or across \nmultiple catchments. As many of the species of fish used to generate this data also occur in the Murray-\nDarling Basin, the prioritisation matrix should have applicability across a wider geographical area than just \nthe Fitzroy Basin. The results should be applicable to the Murray-Darling Basin, Burnett River Basin, and \nBurdekin River Basin in addition to the Fitzroy Basin. Overall, this prioritisation matrix is very similar to that \npresented by Hutchison et al. (2022), but some adjustments to the weightings of flow type have been made \nto reflect the findings from the additional data collected.  \nIt is anticipated that some of the future fish entrainment mitigation will be funded by government or not -for-\nprofit grants. It is important that the funding is used wisely so that the greatest benefit can be achieved for \nthe available investment. There is limited benefit in screening infrastructure that is currently having a minimal \nimpact on fish or expending large amounts of resources on a logistically difficult site, when the same funding \ncould achieve a better outcome for fish at either higher priority or more logistically feasible sites. Some \nirrigators may opt to self-fund installation of fish screens on their properties for reasons other than fish \nentrainment mitigation, such as achieving a more reliable flow of water, reducing pump maintenance. or \ncleaner water that does not clog sprinkler or centre pivot systems. \nModern self-cleaning screens currently available in Australia have been demonstrated to substantially \nreduce fish and fish larvae entrainment (Boys et al. 2021a; Stocks et al. 2024), while maintaining pumping \nefficiency. The Fishscreens.org website features some of the screening options available and case studies of \nthe current fish-screening sites around Australia (https://fishscreens.org.au). Additionally, two useful \npublications available for irrigators considering screening intakes are. “The practical guide to modern fish-\nprotection screening in Australia” (https://fishscreens.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/A-guide-to-modern-\nfish-protection-screening-in-Australia_FINAL_WPA.pdf)  compiled by Boys et al. (2021b) and “Design \nspecifications for fish-protection screens in Australia” (https://fishscreens.org.au/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/11/Design-specifications-for-fish-protection-screens_FINAL_WPA.pdf) compiled by \nBoys (2021).   \nPrioritisation matrix \nThe prioritisation matrix for identifying pumped water offtakes likely to be having the greatest impacts on fish \nis based on a scoring system derived from the trends observed in the data presented in this report. The aim \nof the matrix is to assist with deciding which pumped irrigation infrastructure should be the highest priority for \nmitigation of fish entrainment within a particular irrigation district. Potential options for prioritising between \ndistricts are also discussed. Potential users of the matrix may include state and federal government \nagencies, community groups (e.g., Landcare) and NRM groups, irrigators, agricultural companies, and peak \nbodies representing irrigators. \nThe scoring system relies on four main parameters: \n1)  the type of flow or flows the irrigator is licensed to pump  \n2)  the pump size or capacity in ML/day  \n3)  the pump intake location and depth \n \n45 \n \n4)  the maximum annual allocated volume the irrigator is licensed to take from that pump.   \nShallow intakes are considered those where the top of the intake pipe sits less than 1 metre below the \nsurface when measured during base flow events or typical allocated flow events (they may be further below \nthe surface in bank full flow events). Deep intakes have intake pipes where the top of the intake sits more \nthan one metre below the surface on a baseflow or typical allocated flow event. \nScoring for the flow type, pump rate and intake position and depth focusses around the total number of fish \nentrained. Individual species impacted were a lesser consideration, as these may vary between catchments \nand this matrix is intended to have cross catchment application. However, some consideration was given to \nimpacts on larger fish, as some of the fish larger than 100 mm (especially among the small to medium sized \nspecies) could represent fish in breeding condition or on spawning migrations. These d ifferences were most \nevident for intake location and flow type. Entrainment rates of pelagic larvae were also considered. Pelagic \nlarvae frequently belong to recreationally or socio-economically important species such as golden perch, or \nsome of the terapon perches, which outside the Fitzroy catchment may include species like silver perch. \nPelagic larvae tended to be more prevalent on natural flow events. More generalist common species like \ncarp gudgeon spp and bony bream tended to have larvae present on all pumped flows, as they may spawn \nreadily even in non-flowing conditions. \nThe scores reflect the general trends observed in the data to enable separation of the scoring categories . \nLarger differences between categories are reflected where they exist. For example, to mimic the trends \nobserved in entrainment rate (fish per megalitre) data by pump rate, the increments between categories \nexpanded as the score increased gradually to represent the asymptotic curve of the entrainment rate/ML \ndata. In contrast the total allocated volume scores are strictly linear, reflecting how total vo lume taken will \ndirectly influence the number of fish entrained in a linear fashion for a given pumping rate.  \nThe lowest impact score in each category is scored as a 1. As the categories are cross multiplied to derive a \nfinal score, this ensures that the lowest impact score in each category categories does not lead to any \nincrease in the final score. The weightings of the maximum score are similar across the three categories \nbased on the field-derived data, although the maximum for pump rate is lower than the other two field \ncategories, to reflect the lesser impact of this category identified in the research findings. However, volume \nallocated was given a higher maximum score than the other categories because the variations in total \nallocations are extreme. Extraction of very large volumes will still entrain many fish, even if the rate entrained \nper megalitre is low. The final score is derived from multiplication because of the way each category interacts \nhas a multiplier effect in the field, rather than an additive effect.  \nFlow type the irrigator is licensed to harvest  \nThe following weightings are given to different flow types: \n• Overbank natural flows only = 1  \n• Allocated flows only = 2 \n• Natural flows only = 4  \n• Both natural and allocated flows = 2.5, 3 or 3.5.  \nFor predominantly allocated (supplemental) flows by volume use 2.5, predominantly natural flows by \nvolume use 3.5, approximately equal amounts of allocated and natural flows pumped by volume use \n3. \nJustification: It is unlikely that any irrigator is licensed to take just overbank flows. However, fish and larval \nfish entrainment rates from overbank flows were used a baseline to help derive the scores for allocated flows \nand natural within-bank flows. The low probability of entrainment during overbank flows, means this flow type \nis given a rating of 1. Higher weighting has been given to natural within bank flows than to allocated within -\nbank flows, because on average the survey data found twice as many fish were entrained during natural \nwithin bank flows than during allocated within-bank flows. A similar pattern was also recorded for \nentrainment of fish larvae. Therefore, the weighting for within-bank natural flows is double that for allocated \nwithin-bank flows. In Hutchison et al. (2022) natural flows were weighted slightly higher than allocated flows, \nbut with the collection of additional data and evidence of statistically significant differences, this weighting \nhas been increased. \n \n46 \n \nMost irrigators that pump on natural flow events would pump on both within-bank and overbank flows, with \nmost pumping occurring from within-bank flows. If the irrigator is not located on a river reach with allocated \nflow releases from a dam or weir, then they would only be taking natural flows. Irrigators located downstream \nof weirs and dams that allocate water for pumping may be licensed to take allocated flows only, or they may \nbe licensed to take both natural and allocated flows. Dual access pumps can be  scored 2.5, 3 or 3.5 \ndepending on the approximate proportions of allocated versus natural flows harvested by volume (see \nabove). \nPump rate ML/day   \nThe following weightings are given to different pumping rates: \n• ≤ 30 ML/day = 1.0  \n• 31-60ML/day = 1.5  \n• 61-120ML/day = 2.0  \n• ≥121 ML/day =2.5 \nJustification: Pump rate scoring has been left unchanged from the scoring used in Hutchison et al. (2022). \nPump rate was found to have a positive relationship with number of fish entrained per unit time across \nmultiple species. There was slight positive trend for fish pumped per megalitre, and this was more notable for \nfish > 100 mm. However, error bars were quite large, especially for the higher pumping rates. When \ncalculating annual impacts, the number of fish pumped per megalitre is more important than fish entrained \nper unit time if considering the total amount of water pumped.  The score increases with increasin g pump \nrate to reflect the positive trends observed, but the maximum score is relatively low , to reflect the lesser \nimpact of pump rate compared to the other factors in the prioritisation matrix (flow type, pump intake location \nand depth, and total volume extracted per annum). The width between categories of pumping rates \nincreases as the score rises which reflects the asymptotic curve of entrainment rates by pump rate.  \nMany farms operate twin pumps (or more pumps) in tandem from the same extraction point and these twin \npumps normally have a common outlet point. In scoring these pumps the combined pumped volume is used. \nA farm operating widely separated pumps on different sections of the river with separate outlet points can \nconsider those pumps independently. \nIntake position and depth \nThe following weightings are given to different intake positions and depth combinations:  \n• Bankside shallow = 1  \n• Mid-river channel deep = 3  \n• Bankside deep = 3  \n• Side channel = 3 \nJustification: The weightings for this factor have not changed from those used by Hutchison et al. (2022). \nThe additional data collected in the current project confirmed the trend for bankside shallow intakes to have \nthe lowest impact. Intake position and depth was statistically significant for several species and size classes \nof fish. Just as outlined in Hutchison et al. (2022) the relative impacts of the other intake types were difficult \nto separate. For mid-channel deep, bankside deep and side channel shallow intakes, there were frequently \nno statistically significant differences between these three categories, whereas bankside shallow intakes \nwere often significantly different to one or more of these three categories. Which of these three categories \nhad the greatest impact was highly variable between species. This was also true for fish larvae. When data \nare pooled across species of fish and size classes the entrainment rates for these three cat egories were very \nsimilar.  \nAnnual pumping allocation \nThe following weightings are given to different annual pumping volumes: \n \n47 \n \n• ≤1500 ML/annum = 1  \n• 1501-3000 ML/annum = 2  \n• 3001-4500 ML/annum = 3  \n• 4501-6000 ML/annum = 4  \n• 6001-7500 ML/annum = 5  \n• 7501-9000 ML/annum = 6  \n• 9001-10,500 ML/annum = 7  \n• 10,501-12,000 ML/annum = 8 \n• 12,001-13,500 ML/annum = 9  \n• 13,501-15,000+ ML/annum = 10 \n \nJustification: The matrix scores used for annual pumping allocation remain unchanged from Hutchison et \nal. (2022). The justification also remains unchanged and is repeated here. The figures used are based on \nannual supplemented (allocated flows) and unsupplemented (natural flows) amounts of water able to be \ntaken by irrigators using pumps from rivers in Queensland. The larger totals are generally pumped from \nunsupplemented (natural) flows in Queensland, and it is probably the same in other states. Some properties \nhave volumetric limits well above 25,000 ML per annum. Most growers should have good knowledge of h ow \nmuch water a particular pump takes per year. For properties that have pumps at several locations, the \nannual pumping rate metric needs to be applied to the pump in question and not to the property’s overall \nvolumetric limit. Pump intake location will have a bearing on entrainment of fish, thus pumps on a property \npumping from separate locations need to be considered separately. Whereas twin or multiple pumps \nextracting from the same intake location will need to be considered as one unit. Most growers sho uld know \nwhat the annual pumped amount is for each pump location. The greater the amount of water pumped per \nannum, the greater the number of entrained fish will be, but the total number of fish and the biological impact \nwill be influenced by the pump size, pump intake location and depth and the flow type from which the water \nis pumped. For variable use of twin pumps see other considerations below.  \n \n  \n \n48 \n \nTable 10: Scoring metrics for the different pump intake prioritisation categories  \nFlow type pumped Intake position and \ndepth \nPump rate Annual pumping rate \n(licensed take) \nOverbank only  1 Bankside shallow  1 ≤ 30 ML /day 1 ≤ 1500 ML/annum 1 \nAllocated flows only  2 Bankside deep  3 31-60 ML/day 1.5 1501-3000 ML/annum 2 \nMixed: Mostly allocated by \nvolume, some natural  2.5 Mid- river channel \ndeep  3 61-120 ML/day 2 3001-4500 ML/annum 3 \nMixed: Approx. equal \nvolumes of natural and \nallocated flows  \n 3 Side channel \nshallow  3 ≥121 ML/day 2.5 4501-6000 ML/annum 4 \nMixed: Mostly natural flows \nby volume, some allocated \nflows  \n3.5     6001-7500 ML/annum 5 \nNatural flows only:  within \nand overbank  4     7501-9000 ML/annum 6 \n      9001-10,500 ML/annum 7 \n      10,501-12,000 \nML/annum 8 \n      12,001-13,500 \nML/annum 9 \n      13,501-15,000+ \nML/annum 10 \n \nScore calculations \nTo calculate the final score for a particular pump, the score from each category is cross multiplied. Referring \nto the score metrics for each category in Table 10 use the following procedure to derive the score : \nTotal pump prioritisation score = flow type score x intake position and depth score x pump rate score x \nannual pumped volume score \nBased on the assumption that no grower pumps solely from overbank flows, then the lowest score that can \nbe achieved using the four-step prioritisation matrix will be 2, and the highest possible score that can be \nachieved is 300. The score achieved can be used to rank pumps from least concern (lowest score) to the \ngreatest concern (highest score) \nA grower who pumps only from allocated flows (2) with a bankside deep intake (3), with a 50 ML/day pump \nrate (1.5) and less than 1500 ML annual allocation (1) would receive a score of :   \nTotal pump prioritisation score = 2 x 3 x 1.5 x 1  \n          = 9.0 \n \n49 \n \nA grower who uses a pump for a mixed take of natural and allocated (supplemented) flows, but mostly \nnatural flows by volume (3.5), with a bankside shallow pump intake (1), a 100 ML/day pump rate (2) and an \nannual allocation of 3,100 ML (3) would receive a score of  \nTotal pump prioritisation score = 3.5 x 1 x 3 x 3  \n          = 31.5 \nIf the grower had a side channel shallow intake, then their score would be  \nTotal pump prioritisation score = 3.5 x 3 x 3 x 3  \n          = 94.5 \nOther considerations \nThe following information was also presented in Hutchison et al. (2022). It is re-presented here, with some \nminor updates to reflect the revised scoring system. \nVariable use of twin and multiple pumps at intake points \nIt has already been noted that some irrigators use twin pumps or multiple pumps at a single intake location, \nand it has been recommended above to consider their combined pumping rate for the prioritisation process. \nHowever, there may be some flows where only one pump is operated and other occasions where all pumps \nare operated.  These twin or multi-pump units can be scored using a two-step process.  Most growers should \nhave a good knowledge of the average annual total volume they pump using a single pump or  multiple \npumps at a site.   \nThe worked example below shows how to come up with a prioritisation score in such situations. In this \nexample the farmer has four 100ML/day pumps that he operates together on natural flow events to fill a large \nirrigation storage. (i.e., the farmer pumps at a rate of 400 ML per day). The farmer’s total annual allocation \nfor pumping from natural flows is 4,000 ML.  The farmer can also pump from allocated (supplementary \nflows), but to pump from these flows the farmer uses only one of the 100 ML/day pumps. The ir total annual \nallocation for allocated flows using the single pump is 1,000 ML. All the intakes are bankside deep intakes. \nReferring to Table 19, the score for the four pumps operating together on natural flows is therefore  \nTotal pump prioritisation score = 4 x 3 x 2.5 x 3  \n          = 90 \nThe score for the single pump operating on allocated flows is  \nTotal pump prioritisation score = 2 x 3 x 2 x 1  \n          = 12 \nSumming the two gives a score of 102.    \nIf we had just considered the total allocated volume pumped (5,000 ML), which is mostly natural flow, and \njust treated all four pumps as a single unit, whether all were in use all the time or not, then the default score \nwould have been  \nTotal pump prioritisation score = 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 x 4  \n          = 105.   \nThe combined score of 102 is smaller than the default score and provides a more realistic assessment of the \noverall impact of the use of the combined pumping system in a year. Should the combined score exceed the \ndefault score, which is extremely rare, then the default score can be used.  \nFeasibility \nThe score achieved from the prioritisation matrix will identify pumps as the highest priority for mitigation as a \nfirst step, but as outlined in Hutchison et al. (2022), the feasibility of screening pumps identified as a high \npriority still needs to be considered. Other factors such as accessibility, available power supply, and how the \nexisting infrastructure is configured (for example the intake may be contained within some underwater \nconcrete structure) that could affect how feasible it is to screen an intake need to be considered. Site \ninspections should be undertaken by a screening expert to evaluate the feasibility and cost of screening a \nparticular intake. Some locations may end up being prohibitively expensive to screen ; in which case the \n \n50 \n \nfunding available for mitigation may be better spent at two or more slightly lower priority locations where it is \nmore cost effective install a screen. This would achieve a better overall outcome for the same cost. It can be \ncheaper to install screens when a new pump is installed, rather than try to retrofit a screen to an existing \nsystem. When existing pumps reach the end of their useful life and require replacing, this would be an \nopportune time to consider installing a screen. Modern self-cleaning fish screens can reduce debris \nproblems and the need for back flushing that are experienced by many current trash racks or trash screen \nsystems, so there can be operational advantages to fitting modern self-cleaning fish screens. \nBetween catchment prioritisations \nThe above four-part matrix is designed for prioritisation within an irrigation district or single catchment. When \nprioritising within a particular irrigation area, consideration of individual species impacted is not generally an \nissue because all pumps in an area are likely to be exposed to the same suite of species. The current project \nwas not able to produce susceptibility scores for all species likely to be exposed to entrainment in Australia \nbut has identified olive perchlet as a species highly susceptible to entrainment. This species has declined or \nbecome regionally extinct in parts of the southern Murray-Darling Basin. In catchments of the Murray-Darling \nBasin where recovery programs for this species are underway, special consideration could be given to the \nimpacts of pump entrainment of this species. In such cases, perhaps a higher weighting could be given to \nmid-river channel irrigation intakes, where higher numbers of this species were found entrained in the current \nproject. \nIf prioritising pumps between catchments, consideration may also be given to the species composition of the \ndifferent catchments being considered. For example, catchments might be scored based on the number of \nendangered species present in the reaches where water extraction is taking place or the  number of \nrecreationally or economically important species present in the pumped reach. As knowledge grows on the \nsusceptibility to entrainment of different species, some species may eventually be able to be weight ed more \nhighly than others during inter-catchment prioritisation. Species scores could be used as additional \nmultipliers to the overall prioritisation model or simply used to derive a priority score for catchments and then \npump mitigation work can be directed to catchments in priority order. Alternatively, catchments could be \nclassed as high, medium, or low priorities, which could then be used to generate a 3-, 2-, or 1-times multiplier \nto be applied to the overall model. \nRecommendations \n1. Data from this project suggests that gravity fed diversions have a high impact, but only one such \ndiversion was monitored. Further investigations into impacts of riverine gravity fed diversions are \nrecommended.  \n2. Pumped diversions can be prioritised using a four-part scoring system that considers flow type being \npumped, intake configuration (location and depth), pump rate and total volume pumped per annum. \nConsideration also needs to be given to the costs and feasibility of screening a site as part of the \nprioritisation process. \n3. Future pumped irrigation developments should consider factoring in screening at the design and \nconstruction phase when it will be most cost-effective to install screens, compared to retrofitting them \nlater. When existing pumps reach the end of their useful life, screening of the replacement pump \nshould also be considered because it will be more cost effective. \n  \n \n51 \n \nAcknowledgments \nThanks to the Cotton RDC for providing funding for this work.

Some pumps entrain very \nfew fish, whereas others can entrain high numbers of \nfish and larvae. Recent research has shown that the \nposition and depth (configuration) of the pump intake \nand type of river flow that is being pumped from have a \ngreater influence on the number of fish entrained than \nthe pumping rate. \nIn the research, the position of pump intakes assessed \nwere categorised as: bankside (A), mid-river channel \n(at least several metres from the bank edge) (B), and \nwithin an excavated side channel (C) perpendicular to \nthe river (see diagram). During normal allocated or \nbase flow levels, if the top of the intake was less than 1 \nm below the water surface, pumps were classified as \nshallow, whilst if the top of the intake was greater than \n1 m below the surface they were classified as deep. \n \n                          \n \n \n \n \nBankside shallow intakes generally entrain far fewer \nnative fish than other pump intake configurations. \nEntrainment rates of the other intake configurations \nvary between species, but overall, they have similar \ntotal impacts to each other. \nFlows in the river can be classed as natural within-\nbank, natural overbank (floods) or allocated \n(supplemental) within bank. Pumping from flood flows \nentrains very few fish, but pumping from natural within \nbank flows tends to entrain more fish, more fish larvae \nand more large fish. Pumping from allocated within \nbank flows still entrains fish, but at about half the rate \nof pumping from equivalent natural flows. \nPumping rate has some influence on the number of fish \nentrained per unit time, but the number of fish \nentrained per unit volume of water only increases \nmarginally as rate of pumping increases. The volume \nof water extracted by a pump in a year also influences \ntotal fish entrainment, with higher native fish impacts \noccurring at higher total extraction volumes. \nThis knowledge can be used to score and compare \ndifferent irrigation intakes within a catchment or within \na business. The process can be used to help direct \ninvestment on mitigating impacts to native fish to where \nit will have the greatest impact. \nQueensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries \nresearchers have developed a scoring matrix (next \npage) to assist with identifying which pumps should be \nprioritised for mitigation actions to reduce their impacts \non native fish populations. \n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndaf.qld.gov.au                                  \n \nScoring metrics for the different pump intake prioritisation categories \nFlow type pumped Intake position and \ndepth Pump rate Annual pumping limit \n(licensed take) \nOverbank only 1 Bankside shallow 1 ≤ 30 ML /day 1 ≤ 1500 ML/annum 1 \nAllocated flows only 2 Bankside deep 3 31-60 ML/day 1.5 1501-3000 ML/annum 2 \nMixed: mostly allocated by \nvolume, some natural 2.5 Mid- river channel \ndeep 3 61-120 ML/day 2 3001-4500 ML/annum 3 \nMixed: approx. equal volumes \nof natural and allocated flows 3 Side channel \nshallow 3 ≥121 ML/day 2.5 4501-6000 ML/annum 4 \nMixed: mostly natural flows by \nvolume, some allocated flows 3.5     6001-7500 ML/annum 5 \nNatural flows only: within and \noverbank 4     7501-9000 ML/annum 6 \n      9001-10,500 ML/annum 7 \n      10,501-12,000 ML/annum 8 \n      12,001-13,500 ML/annum 9 \n      13,501-15,000+ \nML/annum 10 \n \nScore calculations \nThe following procedure will enable the total pump \nprioritisation score to be derived. The total pump \nprioritisation score for a particular pump is calculated \nby multiplying the score from each category in the \nabove table.  \nTotal pump prioritisation score = flow type score x \nintake position and depth score x pump rate score x \nannual pumped volume score \nBased on the assumption that no-one pumps only from \noverbank flows, the lowest score that can be achieved \nusing the four-step prioritisation matrix will be 2, and \nthe highest possible score achievable is 300. The total \npump prioritisation scores can be used to rank pumps \nfrom least concern (lowest score) to greatest concern \n(highest score) \nExamples: \nA grower who pumps only from allocated flows (2) with \na bankside deep intake (3), at a rate of 50 ML/day (1.5) \nwith less than 1,500 ML annual limit (1) would receive \na score of:   \n2 x 3 x 1.5 x 1 = 9.0 \nA grower who uses a pump for a mixed take of natural \nand allocated flows, but mostly pumps from natural \nflows by volume (3.5), with a bankside shallow pump \nintake (1), 100 ML/day pump rate (2) and an annual \nlimit of 3,100 ML (3) would receive a score of: \n3.5 x 1 x 3 x 3 = 31.5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndaf.qld.gov.au                                  \n \nIf the grower had a side channel shallow intake, then \ntheir score would be:  \n3.5 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 94.5 \nOther considerations \nSome irrigators use twin or multiple pumps at a single \nintake location, and it is recommended to consider their \ncombined pumping rate for the prioritisation process. \nHowever, there may be flows where only one pump is \noperated and other occasions where all pumps are \nutilised. These multi-pump units can be scored using a \ntwo-step process. Most growers should have a good \nknowledge of the average annual total volume they \npump using a single pump or multiple pumps at a site.   \nThe worked example below shows how to calculate a \nprioritisation score in such situations. In this example \nthe farmer has four 100ML/day pumps that are \noperated together on natural flow events to fill a large \nirrigation storage. (i.e., the farmer pumps at a rate of \n400 ML per day). The farmer’s total annual limit for \npumping from natural flows is 4,000 ML. The farmer \ncan also pump from allocated flows, but in these \ninstances, they only use one of the 100 ML/day pumps. \nTheir total annual limit for allocated flows using the \nsingle pump is 1,000 ML. If all the intake configurations \nare bankside deep, then the score for the four pumps \noperating together on natural flows is: \n4 x 3 x 2.5 x 3 = 90 \nThe score for the single pump operating on allocated \nflows is  \n2 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 12 \nSumming the two gives a score of 102.    \nIf we had just considered the total volume limit pumped \n(5,000 ML), which is mostly natural flow, and treated all \nfour pumps as a single unit, whether all were in use all \nthe time or not, then the default score would have \nbeen: \n3.5 x 3 x 2.5 x 4 = 105   \nThe combined score of 102 is slightly less than the \ndefault score and is a more realistic assessment of the \noverall impact of the use of the combined system in a \nyear. Should the combined score exceed the default \nscore, which is extremely rare, then the default score \ncan be used. \nFeasibility \nThe score achieved from the prioritisation matrix will \nidentify the highest priority pumps for mitigating fish \nentrainment, but the feasibility of screening those \npumps still needs to be considered. Factors such as \naccessibility, available power supply, and the existing \ninfrastructure configuration can affect how feasible it is \nto screen an intake. Site inspections by a screening \nexpert would be needed to evaluate the feasibility and \ncost of screening a particular intake. Some locations \nmay end up being prohibitively expensive to screen. In \nwhich case the funding available for mitigation may be \nbetter spent at two or more slightly lower priority \nlocations where it is more cost effective to install \nscreens to achieve a better overall outcome for the \nsame investment.  \nIt is typically more cost-effective to install screens when \na new pump is installed, rather than try to retrofit a \nscreen to an existing pump. An opportune time to \nconsider fitting a screen is when existing pumps \nrequire replacing. There can be advantages to fitting \nmodern self-cleaning fish screens beyond the benefits \nto fish. Modern self-cleaning fish screens can reduce \ndebris problems and the frequency of back flushing, \ncompared to many current trash racks or trash screen \nsystems. More information on self-cleaning screens \ncan be found on the Fish Screens Australia website. \nhttps://fishscreens.org.au\n  \nFor further information on how the prioritisation matrix \nwas developed, refer to “Impacts and solutions: A \nscoping study on relative impacts of irrigation \ninfrastructure on fish.

Mapped area as a \npercentage of total cotton area was 77% for the 2023/24 season and 63% for the 2024/25 season. Unfortunately, we were unable to \nachieve 80% coverage of the total crop which was our original aim. The commencement of the cotton industry data platform project \npresents an ideal opportunity to re-assess the scope of Satacrop and to explore ongoing funding options. \nObjectives: \n \n Operation of Satacrop platform for 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons \n Advance discussions about the future role of Satacrop, including \n Investigation of alternative funding arrangements \n Automation of data collection \n Expansion of functionality for the platform \n Promote the ongoing use of the platform and achieve 80% of total area mapped for each season \nBackground: \n \nSatacrop has proven to be a valuable tool for cropping industries that allows farmers to log the location of various crop types each \nyear. This allows other farmers and spray operators to determine the location of sensitive crops when they are conducting spray \noperations. Apiarists can also log the location of hives which allows farmers to advise them about farming operations when \nnecessary. \nOngoing maintenance of Satacrop is funded by Cotton Australia. The platform has been expanded to include other cropping \nindustries, in particular grains and horticulture. There has been limited interest in adopting Satacrop from these other industries and \nthere is no appetite from RDC's or peak industry bodies to promote it within those industries. \nThe costs of maintaining the Satacrop platform will continue to be borne by the cotton industry, and this project has provided the \nopportunity to discuss the scope of Satacrop and to investigate alternative funding models for the future. This process is ongoing \nand no definitive path forward has been established as yet. \nResearch \nActivities: \n \nThe research activity consisted of the provision of the Satacrop platform for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons and the investigation \nof alternative funding models and expansion of the scope for the platform. \nOutputs: \n \nThe platform was maintained for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons, with 77% of the total crop mapped in 2023/24 and \n63% mapped in 2024/25. Coverage varies widely between regions and this is detailed in the report attachments. \n \nImpacts: \nCotton crops continue to suffer  the effects of off -target movement of phenoxy herbicides each season. A suite of initiatives are used to \nmitigate the risk of crop damage and it is difficult to separate the degree of impact achieved with each of these. A survey was conducted \nat the Cotton Australia General Meeting in June 2025 that indicated most people believe industry initiatives are having a positive impact, \nand that Satacrop is one of the most important tools assisting in the reduction of spray drift damage in cotton. \nDetailed results for t\n his survey are provided in the attachments. This suggests an ongoing need for Satacrop and we should continue \nto seek out ways to maximise engagement with the platform and to optimise the benefits from ongoing investment in this technology.", "meta": {"filename": "30bea8211057_CA%2010895%20Final%20Report%20Executive%20Summary%20%282%29.pdf", "path": "data/raw/30bea8211057_CA%2010895%20Final%20Report%20Executive%20Summary%20%282%29.pdf", "size_bytes": "152445", "mtime": "2025-08-22T17:04:32.097154", "source_url": "https://www.insidecotton.com/sites/default/files/article-files/CA%2010895%20Final%20Report%20Executive%20Summary%20%282%29.pdf", "source_page": "https://www.insidecotton.com/categories/2025-final-reports", "title": "SataCrop maintenance and hostingMcCollum, D (Cotton Research & Development Corporation (CRDC), Cotton Australia, 2025-06-30)Satacrop continues to be well supported by cotton growers as a valuable tool for mapping sensitive crop areas.", "year": "2025"}}

This cross-sectoral, challenge-based program \nprovides participants with immersive experiences designed to build essential skills, foster strategic thinking, and \nenhance collaboration.\nTailored for individuals recently stepping into leadership roles or seeking to expand their leadership practice, TRAIL focuses \non the following objectives: \nEnhancing self-awareness through the ARLF’s six \ncore areas of leadership practice.\nEstablishing structured pathways for ongoing \nleadership growth.\nExploring leadership enablers such as values, social \nresponsibility, negotiation, critical thinking and \nleading in complexity.\nDeveloping adaptable leadership practices \nresponsive to complex community, workplace, \nsectoral or regional challenges.\nProvide opportunities to build lasting personal and \nprofessional relationships with the ARLF’s network \nof alumni.\nCentral to TRAIL is the development of personal leadership action plans, participation in scenario-based exercises and \nfostering effective communication through courageous conversations. This experiential approach, grounded in Kolb’s \nlearning theory, equips participants to confidently lead with integrity, authenticity and purpose in an increasingly dynamic \nand changing world.\n1\nProgram overview\nThis year, participants began their journey in \nCanberra, starting with a Welcome to Country \nby Paul House outside the National Gallery, \nwho also took the opportunity to share stories \nof his lifelong advocacy work and the ways he \nhas influenced change.\nThe cohort then gathered at Old Parliament \nHouse for a fireside yarn with leaders from \nfour advocacy groups shaping rural, regional, \nand remote Australia. This session featured \nSuzi Tegen (National Rural Health Alliance), \nNatalie Collard (Farmers for Climate Action), \nTroy Williams (National Farmers’ Federation) \nand Ken Dachi (Welcoming Australia). \nTogether, they explored the critical role \nadvocacy plays in shaping policy and driving \nmeaningful change across rural, regional, and \nremote Australia.\nFollowing this session, participants engaged \nwith political staffers at Parliament House, \ngaining firsthand insights into government \nadvocacy processes. These discussions \nprompted deep reflection on contemporary \nleadership amidst complex challenges and \nopportunities within their own sectors and \ncommunities, laying a solid foundation for \nself-advocacy.\nNext, participants moved into the challenge-\nbased outdoor phase of the program, set \nwithin the stunning Namadgi National Park. \nThrough a series of outdoor challenges which \nincluded bushwalking, abseiling, caving \nand raft building, participants engaged in \nthought-provoking discussions, reflecting \non their behaviours, mindsets and values. \nThese activities encouraged them to explore \nalternative perspectives on leadership and \nchallenges, deepening their understanding of \nhow others navigate complexity.\nThe final stage of the program featured ARLF \nFellow Dan Bourchier (ABC journalist) and \nJonothan Watchman from Rabbit and Lion, \nwho led a series of practical workshops on \ncrafting and delivering messages effectively. \nParticipants learned how to communicate \nwith impact across diverse audiences and \nmedia platforms, aided by applying their \nunderstanding of DISC behavioural profiling \nto their messaging, equipping them with the \nskills to engage stakeholders with confidence.\nAs the program drew to a close, participants \ngathered around the fire for an evening with \nHer Excellency the Governor-General, Sam \nMostyn AC, where she shared her personal \nleadership journey, the challenges she has \nfaced and how she has created meaningful \nimpact throughout her career.\nThe experience concluded with participants \ndeveloping and sharing personal leadership \naction plans, affirming their commitment to \ncontinued growth and their future leadership \nimpact within their industries, communities \nand beyond.\n“I would definitely \nrecommend it for \nother people that are \nhands on learners. \nCouldn’t fault \nanything I enjoyed all \nmy time there”\nJesse Janes \nTRAIL 2025 Participant\n2025 TRAIL: Emerging Leaders Program Report Australian Rural Leadership Foundation\n2\nTRAIL 17 (2025) cohort \nParticipant State Organisation\nAmy Hunter WA CBH Group\nAndric Lu QLD Queensland Health \nAngus Dunne ACT SNSW Innovation Hub \nBonnie Armour SA Hills and Fleurieu Landscape Board \nBrittany Bickford VIC Rural Bank (Bendigo Bank) \nCharlene Cressbrook QLD Cape York Natural Resource Management \nChristine Plummer NSW LLS NSW\nDale McDonald NSW Base Five Co - Health\nDimity Betts NSW Hunter New England Primary Health Network (The PHN) \nEmma Frankel-Vaughan SA Viterra \nEmma Wostear QLD Pakaderinga Feedlot\nFrances Kirby SA Australian Migrant Resource Centre \nGabrielle Chaffey NSW Syngenta\nJesse Janes VIC Kinross Farms (Sponsored by Australian Eggs)\nJoe Gibson Vic goFARM\nJohn Butler SA Hills and Fleurieu Landscape Board \nJoshua Petty QLD Whyalla Beef\nKelsie Prowse SA The Apple Farm \nKimberley Kunde QLD Red Earth Community Foundation \nKrystie Bremer WA Gascoyne Catchments Group Inc \nLinda Vernon WA North Eastern Wheatbelt Travel Association \nLucy Gallagher NSW Tarrabah Pastoral Co. \nMadison Tims NSW Thoroughbred Breeders Australia (Sponsored by AgriFutures Australia)\nMichelle Ware QLD Torres Strait Regional Council (Sponsored by Torres Strait Regional Authority)\nRebekah Haase QLD Grey Galah Bed and Breakfast \nRemy Malet WA Carbon Sync \nRenee Bester QLD Etheridge Shire Council \nSarah Tsai NT Northern Territory Government \nSharna Holman QLD Queensland Department of Primary Industries (Sponsored by Cotton Research & \nDevelopment Corporation)\nTammy O’Malley SA Coorong District Council \n2025 TRAIL: Emerging Leaders Program Report Australian Rural Leadership Foundation\n3\nParticipant feedback\nAt the conclusion of the program, we ask \nparticipants to provide feedback on various \naspects, including their registration and \nonboarding experience, as well as the \nprogram itself. \nBelow are some key metrics from this \nfeedback process: \n » 100% of participants were satisfied or very \nsatisfied with the program, with an average \nscore of 4.89 on a scale from 1-5.\n » 89% of TRAIL participants would \nrecommend the program to a friend \nor colleague, which reflects the strong \npositive impact and value that participants \nattribute to the program. (NPS score = 89 \non scale from -100 to 100, as there were no \ndetractors).\n » 96% of participants rated the connections \nmade with other participants as being very \nor extremely meaningful.\n » 100% of participants expressed an interest \nin further leadership development through \nthe ARLF.\n“Learning has really been a constant \nin my life, and this experience was a \nchance to both gain the insight and \nexperience as a leader and a follower. \nThe program set all of us up with \nopportunities to test and explore \ndifferent ways of being in a leadership \nrole, or to flesh out what leadership \nactually meant for us as individuals.”\nDale McDonald \nTRAIL 2025 Participant\nAs part of the program’s debrief, facilitators \nwere also asked about their insights into the \nprogram and the cohort. Simone Carroll-\nGermech, TRAIL Program Manager and \nfacilitator, commented on the cohort’s ongoing \nimpact: \n“The TRAIL participants are always a pleasure to  \nwork with, bringing an open mindset and a  \nwillingness to identify blind spots early in their  \nleadership journey. However , this year’s cohort was truly exceptional. \nFrom the very first day, they gave their all, fully embracing both the \nexperience and the strength of their network. Their depth of thinking, \nadaptability and engagement were remarkable, instilling in me a deep \nconfidence that the future of leadership in rural, regional and remote \nAustralia is in excellent hands.”\nOur TRAIL participants spoke of the ‘life-\nchanging’ nature of the program; facilitators \nwere commended on their caring and \nnurturing attitude and their effectiveness \nin adapting their style to suit different \npersonalities in the group. Many also spoke \nof the richness and impactful nature of the \nprogram and experience, where they learned \nmore about self and others due to the physical \nnature of the program design and related \nactivities. \nOne participant described the program’s \nongoing impact vividly: “…I was looking for a \nwater shed moment, and I found a tsunami.” \nOthers spoke of a perfect storm, with the \ncontent, the cohort, their own lives and \nbusyness coming together to create a life-\nchanging experience.\n2025 TRAIL: Emerging Leaders Program Report Australian Rural Leadership Foundation\n4\nProgram evolution\nDrawing upon the insights gathered from our \nTRAIL participants and facilitators we have \nidentified the following key areas for ongoing \nconsideration:\n » Consistent messaging regarding program \nrequirements and expectations.\n » User-friendliness of systems used for \nregistration. \nWe are very grateful for all the feedback we \nhave received from this year’s TRAIL cohort \nand are working to implement the following \nin response to ensure we continue to deliver \nan excellent and impactful experience for all \nparticipants:\n » We are working to ensure a more unified and \nconsistent user experience for registrations, \nand to make sure the information provided is \nsimilar regardless of what platform is used \nto share that information (email, Mighty \nNetworks social media platform, etc.). \n » Continuing to review our program schedule \nto allow for more time for reflection, \ngrounding and connecting. \n“The TRAIL program \nnot only gives you those \ntechnical capabilities, but it \ngives you the safe space to \npush outside your comfort \nzone around people that you \nhaven’t known for very long, \nbut you’re all there for the \nsame reason.”\n Renee Bester \nTRAIL 2025 Participant\n“I’ve realised I don’t have to know \neverything. I really learned that this \nweek, knowledge is one thing, but having \nthese leadership skills is so much more \nimportant, because we’ll never stop \nlearning, and everybody has knowledge and \nexperiences to share, and we can all grow \nfrom the connections we make because of \nthat.”\nLucy Gallagher, \nTRAIL 2025 Participant\n2025 TRAIL: Emerging Leaders Program Report Australian Rural Leadership Foundation\n5\nA message for our 2025 TRAIL partners\nWe extend our sincere thanks to all our TRAIL partners. Without your support, TRAIL and our continued work and impact \nin regional, rural and remote Australia would not be possible. Future businesses, industries and communities will benefit \ngreatly from this exceptional cohort of emerging leaders. We look forward to seeing the lasting legacy these graduates \nwill create through their collective leadership.\n  \n“Mel, Benny and Lauren were the \nmost incredible people to have \nalongside us in our journey. They all \ntaught me a huge amount as a person \nand as a leader. The people in our \ngroup and the connections we have \nall built with each other is a reflection \non the leaders that our mentors and \nfacilitators are.”\nTRAIL 2025 Participant\n“The experience was definitely one of \ndeep learning.

This is a long-term project \naimed at gathering Cotton Production Data and seasonal trends for the Australian Cotton Industry and spans a period of \n25 plus years.  \n \nOver the years the process has graduated from being paper based forms filled out throughout the seasons to delivery and \nquality checking on platforms including: \n• Excel as a base template \n• Agworld \n• C-vent – the platform used for the qualitative survey, and \n• A data management platform (DMP) developed by Morgan Rural Tech for CCA as a means of ensuring that the \nquantitative data can be collated in one format, despite how it is received by CCA.  \n \nThe most recent project term, covering cotton growing seasons ending 2022 – 2024, has seen good average coverage - \naround 40% of the cotton growing area. Significant changes in this phase of the project are: \n• An increase in the number of regions in Australia where cotton is grown consistently – extending to Northern \nAustralia and the Wide Bay/Fraser/Burnett regions of Queensland \n• Transitioning of the qualitative survey report from a printed publication to an electronic, online publication and \n• The inclusion of ‘extended’ data in the quantitative survey to ensure that data is being collected on inputs that are \nconsidered significant for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions for the cotton industry.  \n \nThe categories of ‘base’ data collected in the quantitative survey include; \n• Variety \n• Herbicides \n• Insecticides \n• Plant Growth Regulators \n• Defoliants \n \nThe categories of ‘base’ data collected in the quantitative survey include; \n• Applied nutrient (ground and foliar applied fertiliser) \n• Production (yield) \n• Irrigation, (water use, type of irrigation, energy source for pumps, water source) \n• Tillage operations (tillage in crop and the preceding fallow, type of operation, date of operation)  \n• and miscellaneous data including previous crop, length of fallow, distance to nearest gin. \n \nIncreased rewards have been offered to survey participants in this iteration of the project to encourage the submission of \nbase and extended data. The tables in Appendix 1 of this report show that the percentage area of extended data \ncontributions has increased over the three-year term, particularly nutrient and tillage data. \n \nFor the qualitative component of the project, survey questions encompassing the following topics have been consistently \nasked during this phase of the project; \n• demographic makeup of the consultancy business and team \n• Number of clients and regions in which they work \n• Planting and farming system  \n• Crop protection (pests and diseases) \n2 \n \n• Weed management \n• Spray applications \n• Nutrition management \n• Water management \n• Factors affecting yield \n• Helicoverpa survival rates \n• Sustainability \n• CRDC and Cottoninfo program recognition. \n \nCoverage and response rates for the qualitative survey are summarised in the table below.  \n \nCCA 2202 Quantitative Survey Coverage figures \nSeason No of \nconsultants \nNo of cotton \ngrowers \nNo of hectares \n(Not adjusted \nfor row \nspacing) \nPercentage of \ncotton production \narea \n2021/22 60 413 285,723 52% \n2022/23 60 393 291,583 43% \n2023/24 54 328 202,774 37% \n \nLimited rewards have been offered to participants for completing the qualitative survey – and the participation rate has \ndecreased over the past three years of the project.  \n \nImplications for the next phase of the project \n \nCRDC and CCA are continuing to work together to undertake the Cotton Consultants’ qualitative and quantitative surveys \nbeyond the 2023/24 season and making some changes and adaptations to work with evolving data collection systems for \nthe industry as well as encouraging continued participation and coverage. Some of the changes that are being considered \nfor the next phase of the project are: \n• Increasing focus on the qualitative survey as this is the component of the project that has more long-term \napplication. This includes refining the questions and offering more incentives to participate \n• Areas that have evolved with farming systems and technologies where questions will be introduced are the use of \nprecision agriculture tools (optical spray technology) and the use of organic fertilisers \n• After the second year of the new project – there is potential to look at undertaking some trend analysis of the \nrepeated questions/topics in the qualitative survey \n• The quantitative data will continue to be collected, however as CRDC is working on systems to collate this data on \na larger scale, this component will be phased out into the future \n• Rewards/incentives will continue to be offered for this data however more focus will be on more complete sets of \nextended data. \n \nAppendix 1 attached illustrates the geographic coverage of the quantitative survey as well as the amount of extended data \ncontributed of the past three seasons on the project (CCA 2202) \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCCA Cotton Market Audit 2021/22 - Data Coverage\nSource: 2021/22 Australian Cotton Production Forecast (Cotton Australia).

Weeds are constantly evolving, and \nchanges in weed types and their characteristics require ongoing \nadaptation of management. Farming systems also evolve, \nintroducing new weed management challenges and opportunities. \nThis dynamic nature of weed management often leads to shifting \ndemands for research, development and extension specific to \nweeds and local farming systems. This study, funded by the \nGrains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) and \nCotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC), aims to \ninform R&D investment priorities and industry at a broader scale. \nGiven the wide range of weeds, agroecological zones (AEZs), \nimpacts and management demands across variable seasons, it \nis not simple to identify where and in what form the largest costs \nare incurred. \nThe last major study of the distribution and economic impact \nof weeds in Australian cropping systems (Llewellyn et al., 2016) \nbegan more than a decade ago and drew upon data from the \nperiod 2010 to 2014. The study focused only on grain production, \nand the overall cost of weeds to Australian grain growers was \nestimated to be $3300 million.\nThe results of this new study represent the most comprehensive \nnational analysis of the cost of weeds to Australian broadacre \ncrop production. The study covers the 14 major GRDC-defined \nagroecological zones across the western, southern and northern \nregions, and the major crop types of wheat, barley, oats, canola, \npulses, grain sorghum and – new to this study – cotton. This \nreport outlines the study methods and then presents the results \nfor the cost of weeds in grain crops, cotton crops and, finally, the \ncost for grain and cotton crops combined.\nThe analysis is based on a modified, broadened and updated \nversion of the national weed impact model used in the 2016 study. \nIt includes the costs of yield loss due to in-crop weeds, water \nand nutrient use by fallow weeds, weed contamination, off-target \nherbicide impacts and weed control. Weed control costs, such as \nherbicide and non-herbicide practices, include seed technology \ncosts attributable to weed control. \nInputs used to represent cropping and farms in each AEZ have \nbeen informed by newly available data sources, including the \nGRDC Farm Practice Survey results; national herbicide resistance \npaddock survey data, including weed presence and density \nassessments; proprietary Kynetec annual herbicide farmer panel \ndata; Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) production data; GRDC \nNational Variety Trial yield results; Australian Pesticides and \nVeterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) herbicide sales values; \nregional crop planning guides; and a panel of regional agronomy \nand weed management advisers, including cotton weed \nmanagement experts.\nKey annual results at a national level include:\n ■ The overall cost of weeds to Australian grain and cotton \ngrowers is estimated to be $4434 million (an average of  \n$206 per hectare) in weed control and crop losses. \n ■ Expenditure and losses in grain crops is $4289 million \n(average $203/ha), while in cotton crops it is $145 million \n(average $445/ha).\n ■ Expenditure on weed control in grain and cotton crops, \nincluding herbicide and non-herbicide practices, is estimated \nto average $180/ha. Average expenditure is $176/ha in grain \ncrops and $387/ha in cotton.\n ■ Yield losses due to weeds amounted to 1.2 million tonnes  \nof grain.\n ■ Nationally, in terms of cost, the major weeds in grain crops are \nryegrass, brome grass, sow thistle, wild radish and wild oats. \nThese results demonstrate the ongoing dominance of ryegrass \nas the most costly weed to Australian broadacre cropping.\n ■ The study estimates $637 million is spent on fallow weed \ncontrol through herbicide application: $611 million in grain crops \n($29/ha) and $26 million in cotton ($80/ha).\n ■ Weeds in fallows are still estimated to be costing more than \n$261 million through reduced crop yields ($111 million) and extra \nfertiliser requirements ($150 million). \n ■ Nationally, the fallow weeds most costly to grain production are \nmelons, heliotrope / potato weed and fleabane, while in cotton \nthey are heliotrope / potato weed, wild turnip and windmill grass.\n ■ Overall, in-crop residual weed densities were found to be \ntypically low due to the major investment in managing weeds \nand maintaining low-weed seedbanks. Average revenue loss \ndue to weed populations reducing crop yields (in-crop and \nfallow) was $24/ha.\n ■ Notable similarities and differences between these results and \nthose found a decade earlier include the following: \n ☐ Expenditure dominates the overall cost of weeds relative \nto the costs incurred through yield loss.\n ☐ Herbicide use contributes to more than 70 per cent of  \nall expenditure. \n ☐ Revenue losses due to yield reductions from fallow \nweeds are lower than in the 2016 study, reflecting \nincreasing management attention to fallow weed control.\n ☐ Top fallow weeds are similar and include melons, \nheliotrope / potato weed and fleabane.\n ☐ The top residual weed in grain crops is annual ryegrass. \nBrome grass was a weed of rising importance in 2016 \nand has now become the second-costliest weed.\nAustralian grain and cotton growers continue to invest heavily in \nweed management, mostly through herbicide-based methods, \nand continue to minimise yield losses due to in-crop weed \npopulations. Yield loss costs due to in-crop weed competition \n($516 million) are much lower than total weed management costs \n($3857 million). This is despite increasing herbicide resistance \nand major shifts in cropping systems in many regions, such as \nincreased early and dry seeding that does not allow for substantial \npre-crop weed control. Increased investment in the widened \nrange of pre-emergent herbicides and, in some cases, herbicide-\ntolerant crops has been an enabling factor.  ☐\n10\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \nWeeds present one of the largest costs to broadacre crop \ngrowers. As climate, cropping systems, weeds and weed \nmanagement options change, understanding the relative costs \nand benefits of different weed problems and practices can help \nto identify future research, development and extension priorities \nand opportunities. \nSeveral studies have quantified the cost of agricultural weeds \nin Australia (for example Combellack, 1987; Jones et al., 2000; \nSinden et al., 2004). Llewellyn et al. (2016) was the most \ncomprehensive analysis of weed management and costs \nin Australia’s grain-growing regions and a basis for broader \nassessments of agricultural and non-agricultural national weed \ncost assessment (McLeod, 2018). To estimate the cost of weeds, \nmost of these studies developed an economic model that \nconsiders residual losses and control costs as expenditure. \nThe model used in this report quantified the cost of weeds due \nto direct yield loss, management and other indirect costs. This \napproach was taken in the Jones et al. (2000) model, which \nevaluated yield losses and weed control expenditure in major \ngrain crops (excluding fallow weeds) over one growing season. \nThey found that in 1998-99 the financial cost of weeds was  \n$1182 million (or $2616 million in terms of 2020-21 dollars). \nIn that study, expenditure dominated the total cost of weeds \nwith herbicides accounting for 73 per cent of all expenditure. \nCultivation was the only non-herbicide management option \nconsidered. The costliest weeds nationally were annual ryegrass, \nwild oats and wild radish. Earlier, Combellack (1987) found \ncultivation costs to be more than four times greater than estimates \nof herbicide costs, with total weed management costs amounting \nto 57 per cent of the estimated total cost of weeds. \nLlewellyn et al. (2016) evaluated yield losses and expenditure \nin grain crops in a similar manner to Jones et al. (2000). They \nreported a cost of weeds in Australia totalling $3300 million  \n(or $3997 million in terms of 2020-21 dollars). As in the 2000 \nstudy, expenditure made up most of the total costs of weeds  \n(78 per cent). This study considered a wider range of control \npractices but still found that herbicide weed control practices \naccounted for 74 per cent of all expenditure. In both studies, \nresidual weed populations were determined by a survey of \ngrowers. The costliest weeds nationally were annual ryegrass, wild \nradish and wild oats. The 2016 study identified key fallow weeds, \nincluding melons, heliotrope / potato weed and fleabane.\nMore recently, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource \nEconomics and Sciences (ABARES) commissioned a report on \nthe cost of established pest animals and weeds to Australian \nagricultural growers (Hafi et al., 2023). The study looked at animal \npests and weeds in multiple industries and drew on a variety of \ndata sources, including the Llewellyn et al. (2016) report. Nationally, \nthe average estimated total cost of weeds in coarse grains, \noilseeds, pulses and cotton was $3580 million; estimates ranged \nfrom $3013 million to $4049 million to account for uncertainty in \nthe model. The total costs are dominated by private control cost \nwith residual losses contributing to about one-quarter of the  \ntotal costs. \nIn this study, we broadened the scope of the Llewellyn et al. (2016) \nstudy, modifying the national weed impact model to evaluate the \ndistribution and economic importance of weeds to Australian \ngrain and cotton growers. Including cotton is an important \nconsideration when evaluating the overall impact of weeds in \ncotton-growing regions, especially where cotton is part of the \nlocal cropping system alongside grain crops. This report presents \nimpacts on production and costs, and it breaks down the use of \nweed management practices at the agroecological zone (AEZ), \ngrain-growing region and national levels. Notably, in the 2016 \nnational weed impact model, managing herbicide-resistant weeds \nwas considered an additional cost above a grower’s everyday \nweed management practice. Since then, herbicide-resistant \nweeds have become more prevalent, and managing common \nforms of herbicide resistance has become part of standard \nfarming management. With this shift in management approach, \nthe model no longer considers herbicide resistance as an \nidentifiable ‘additional’ cost. The revised model also accounts for \nadditional factors such as yield damage due to off-target herbicide \napplications, integrated weed management (IWM) practices that \nwere not extensively used a decade ago (such as harvest weed \nseed mills) and technology costs associated with herbicide-\ntolerant crop options. \nNew elements in this study include:\n ■ cotton crops;\n ■ break crops used specifically for weed management;\n ■ seeding strategies used specifically for weed management;\n ■ the cost of managing herbicide-resistant weeds being included \nin the standard weed control program;\n ■ seed technology costs in canola and cotton crops;\n ■ three residual weed types being used to estimate in-crop yield \nlosses; and\n ■ yield damage and revenue loss associated with off-target \nherbicide damage.\n1 Introduction\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n11\n2.1 Data\n2.1.1 Geographical regions for survey\nThe study covers the major grain and cotton production areas \nof Australia. The survey’s geographical units are based on the \nGrains Research and Development Corporation’s (GRDC’s) AEZs \nfrom the three GRDC regions, including the northern region, \nwhich produces both cotton and grain crops (Figure 1). As in the \n2016 study, some AEZs lacked sufficient data and were merged. \nIn this study, WA Sandplain and Mallee were included in the one \nAEZ. We define the northern, southern and western regions as \nregions that include a subset of AEZs. We do not refer to GRDC-\ndefined subregions, which generally have a larger boundary area \nthan that represented by the included AEZs. The western region \nincluded the following AEZs: WA Northern, WA Eastern, WA \nCentral and WA Sandplain/Mallee. The southern region includes \nSA Mid/Y orke/Eyre, SA/Vic Mallee, SA/Vic/Bordertown/Wimmera, \nTas, Vic High Rainfall. The northern region includes Qld Central, \nNSW NE / Qld SE, NSW NW / Qld SW, NSW/Vic Slopes and  \nNSW Central. Cotton crops are included in the NSW NE / Qld SE, \nNSW NW / Qld SW AEZs.\n2 Method\nSource: supplied by Kynetec\n0 500 1000 1500km\nNT\nWA\nQLD\nNSW\nVIC\nACT\nTAS\nSA\nNorth\nQld Central NSW NE/Qld SE NSW NW/Qld SW  \nNSW Vic Slopes NSW Central Vic High Rainfall \nWA Mallee WA Eastern WA Central\nWA Northern Tasmania Grain\nSA Midnorth-Lower Yorke Eyre WA Sandplain\nSA Vic Bordertown-Wimmera SA Vic Mallee\nFigure 1: The agro-ecological zones (AEZs) included in GRDC regions .\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n12\n2.1.2 Crop production \nThe scope of the analysis was restricted to major Australian grain \nand cotton crops, based on available national Australian Bureau \nof Statistics (ABS) production figures. Crops selected were wheat, \nbarley, oats, canola, grain sorghum, pulses and cotton. Pulses were \ndefined to include legume grain crops like chickpeas, field peas, \nlupins, lentils, faba beans, mungbeans, navy beans and vetch.\nFor the AEZs where cotton is grown, the majority (70 per cent) is \nirrigated, with QLD Central and NSW Central growers frequently \ngrowing more irrigated than dryland cotton. It should be noted that \nthis is an average over all AEZs for the study period, and the amount \nof dryland cotton fluctuates depending on the season. Furthermore, \ncotton production data is often reported by cotton valleys that do \nnot align with AEZs.\nBased on ABS and ABARES data for each AEZ, Kynetec assembled \ngrain crop production figures for the period 2018-19 to 2020-21 \n(Table 1) to help address production volatility. Figure 2a illustrates the \nnational values of grain, oilseed and pulses over time, and Figure 2b \nillustrates that of cotton. The green-shaded areas highlight the study \nperiod, which was characterised by high volatility. To address this, \nwe used average values from these years in our analysis to smooth \nout the fluctuations. Due to a lack of detailed data for pulse crops, \nthis crop grouping was evaluated by using a weighted average \nand estimated tonnages at a local level. Although crop production \nwas lower for all crops during the period 2018-19 to 2020-21, cotton \nproduction over these study years was much lower than the long-\nterm average, with 2019-20 recording the lowest cotton production \nin 37 years. Therefore, the model used five-year production \naverages for cotton crops. The Kynetec-assembled crop production \nfigures for the period 2017-18 to 2020-21 are shown in Table 1. \nTo estimate a ‘weed free‘ yield potential from which weed-related \nyield losses are deducted for each crop type for the study period, \nthe model used a midpoint between ‘actual’ recorded yield data \nfrom the ABS and National Variety Trials (NVT) data compiled from \nwithin each AEZ (Table 25 to Table 30, pages 35 to 38). Using \nmodelled yield potential was not an option as not all crop types \nrepresented in the study can be adequately modelled using the \nsame modelling method. The crop production data area was used \nto set the lower bound of weed-free yield, and the NVT results \ninformed the upper bound. We used weed-free yields in the \nmodel to represent potential yield in the absence of weeds that \nmay affect crop yield through in-crop competition and the use of \nresources during a prior fallow. \n2.1.3 Representative farm\nEach ‘representative farm’ reflects the average cropping mix and \nfarm area and reflects the ABARES and/or ABS total areas. These \nvalues were obtained from the most recent GRDC Farm Practices \nSurvey (FPS) conducted in 2021 (Table 2 – page 13) (Umbers, \n2021). The farm practice use was applied to a representative farm \narea informed by a mix of data sources.

The cost \nof weeds in grain and cotton production is a function of crop yield \nlosses arising from a reduction in yield from weeds (in-crop and \nfallow), off-target herbicide damage, cleaning costs from grain \ncontamination and expenditure for weed control. Weed control \ntreatments considered in this study include herbicides applied \nin-crop (which includes pre-emergence herbicides and pre-\nseeding knockdown) and during the fallow period, the use of seed \ntechnology (such as GM crops), crop topping (in broadleaf and \ncereal crops), narrow windrow burning, seed milling, chaff lining \nand chaff tramlining, chaff cart, bale direct, tillage prior to sowing, \ndelayed seeding with knockdown, double knock, burning stubble \nfor weed control, the use of manure crops, competitive crop \nseeding, break crops and chipping (in cotton crops). The total cost \nof weeds (C) is broken down simply into categories of loss (L) and \nexpenditure (E), as follows: \nC = L + E\nAs per Llewellyn et al. (2016), we restricted loss (L) to the yield \neffects caused by weeds in crops (e.g. yield loss due to in-crop \nweeds or weeds in preceding fallows, plus some consideration \nof off-target herbicide damage in the new study). The inputs used \nto control weeds, including labour and application costs (e.g. fuel \nuse), are included in expenditure (E). The influence of weeds on \ncrop choice (e.g. growing a less profitable break crop due to the \nneed for weed control relative to what might have been a more \nprofitable crop option) has been included in the analysis. This \nrepresents a form of opportunity cost attributable to weeds.\n2.2.1  Crop yield and revenue losses  \ndue to weeds\nResidual weeds and fallow are used in the model to calculate yield \nlosses associated with the presence of weeds. Residual weeds can \nbe defined as weeds that are growing after typical in-crop control \nefforts. Weed profiles, data on weed density and distribution, and \nyield loss coefficients underpin the resulting yield and revenue loss \nassociated with weed presence. The model uses the most common \nresidual weeds (late in the season) in cereal, broadleaf, sorghum and \ncotton crops and common weeds in fallow. The model also requires \nthe weed occurrence (which is defined as the percentage of the \ncropped area in which the weed occurred) and its typical density \nnear harvest time. Density is categorised as very low (occasional \nplant), low (<1 plant/m2), medium (1 to 10 plants/m2), high (>10 plants/m2) \nand very high (>50 plants/m2 and dominating the crop). \nWeed profile, density and distribution data were estimated using \na range of sources, including the advisory groups and workshops. \nWhile in-paddock occurrence and density data did exist, this was \nonly for a single season during the study period, so particular \nseasonal effects needed to be considered. To reach consensus \non weed occurrence and density assumptions for grains crops in \neach AEZ, the advisory groups were initially presented with results \nfrom the 2016 study for each AEZ and crop type. These results \ncame from grower assessments via 600 phone interviews and \nfrom the 2020 random paddock survey involving more than 2000 \npre-harvest paddock visits detailing weed species for each AEZ, \nbut not specific to crop type (Broster et al., 2024). As confirmed \nby the cotton advisory groups, residual weeds in cotton generally \noccur at exceptionally low densities, and the impact on cotton \nyield is recognised as being generally very low (Cameron et al., \n2016; Koetz et al., 2023; Werth et al., 2013). \nGRDC agrocological zones and grain growing regions: northern, southern, western.\nFigure 3: Conceptual framework for the cost of weeds.\nSources: Regional advisory workshops, Kyenetic herbicide panel data, ABS, ABARES, GRDC farm practice survey, National Variety Trials, random paddock survey, Weed Wizard,\nsummer weeds tool, World Bank for urea price, Planfarm, PIRSA gross margin guides, APVMA herbicide sales, journal articles on weeds, industry and government reports\nCrops include \nwheat, barley, \noats, canola,\npulses, sorghum \nand cotton Yield and \nrevenue loss\nCost of weed \nper rep farm\nCost of weeds \nper AEZ\nExpenditures on \nweed control\nChaﬀ \nlining/tramlining, \nseed milling, \ncrop topping, \nchaﬀ cart, bale \ndirect. delayed \nseeding, burn \nstubble, manure \ncropping, \ncompetitive \ncrop seeding, \nbreak crops, \nchipping in \ncotton, tillage.\nHebicide \nin-crop\nHebicide in \npreceding \nfallow\nSeed \ntechnology\nIntegrated \nweed \nmanagement \npractices\nYield and \nrevenue loss \nin-crop\nYield and \nrevenue loss \nin preceding \nfallow\nRevenue \nloss due to \ngrain \ncleaning \ncost\nYield and \nrevenue loss \ndue to \noﬀ-target \nherbicide \ndamage\nThree most \ncommon weeds \nin-crop and \nfallow based on \narea of \ninfestation, yield \nloss and \nrevenue loss\nPre-emergentKnockdown Post-emergent\nScaled up based\non production\nstatics\nFigure 3: Conceptual framework for the cost of weeds .\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n15\nAnalysis of the 2020 random weed survey (Broster et al., \n2024) indicated that growers typically have multiple residual \nweed species (most commonly three or fewer species) in many \npaddocks. Practices will often control more than one weed, and \ninter-weed competition plays a role in weed management when \nmultiple weeds are present (Monjardino et al., 2003). The model \nconsiders the three most common weeds in-crop and also during \nfallow. In each representative farm the three in-crop weeds \nidentified generally include at least one grass weed (for example, \nannual ryegrass) and one broadleaf weed (for example, wild \nradish). Exceptions were NSW NE / Qld SE AEZs, where the most \ncommon residual weeds identified in broadleaf crops were all \nbroadleaf weeds, and in WA Eastern AEZ broadleaf crops, where \nall of the most common weeds identified were grass weeds.\nRESIDUAL CROPPING WEEDS\nRevenue losses were calculated using the three common residual \nweeds identified in the grower advisory workshops, with information \non their occurrence and density, as well as weed-free yield and \ncrop competition factors (detailed in Table 32 – page 39, and based \non competition factors from the Weed Seed Wizard database and \noutputs (Charles et al., 1998, 2019a, 2019b; Manalil et al., 2020; \nPeltzer et al., 2012; Renton et al., 2008, 2017)). Yield losses were \nspecific to the weed identified for a certain crop and the density \nspecified for a representative set of conditions for each AEZ. Loss in \nrevenue due to in-crop weed competition from residual weeds was \ncalculated first as yield loss and then as a revenue loss:\nYLcw = Areaw × Wfyc × Ylcw\nWhere YLcw represents yield loss for crop c and weed w, Areaw is \nthe area of weed as per representative farm, Wfyc is the weed-free \nyield for crop c and Ylcw  denotes yield loss coefficient for weed w. \nAs the pulse category represents a range of possible pulse \nspecies across the regions, a common standard pulse crop \n(lupins) was assumed for determining yield loss coefficients in the \nsouthern and western regions. In the northern region, we assumed \nchickpeas represented the pulse category (with weed yield loss \ncoefficients 20 per cent higher than those assumed for lupins). \nThe revenue loss is calculated as:\nRLcw = YLcw × Prc\nWhere RLcw represents revenue loss for crop c and weed w, YLcw \nis the yield loss for crop c and weed w, and Prc  denotes crop \nprice ($ per tonne). \nThe revenue loss in the first instance is calculated for each \nrepresentative farm. This is then ‘grossed up’ to represent the \nproduction data by crop type collated by Kynetec using Kynetec, \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics and Australian Bureau of Agricultural \nand Resource Economics and Sciences data (note the grossed-up \nvalue is calculated from production area divided by the representative \nfarm crop area based on GRDC Farm Practice Survey).\nFALLOW WEEDS\nCosts in fallow weeds were calculated in a similar way to costs \nof residual weeds in crops except that the area sprayed was \nconsidered along with costs associated with replacing nitrogen \n(N) used by the fallow weeds. The yield loss was calculated \nby splitting the fallow area into sprayed and unsprayed areas. \nBoth cropping areas attracted a yield loss for the subsequent \ncrop; however, the sprayed area had 25 per cent less yield \ndamage than unsprayed areas. The model estimates the area of \nsprayed and unsprayed cropping land by considering the weed \noccurrence on the representative farm as well as the area of \ncropping land receiving fallow herbicide. It also considers several \nrules to ensure fallow spraying is not overestimated.\nThe yield loss in the following crop was calculated using the area \nof crop type multiplied by the fallow yield loss coefficient. The \nmodel calculates the revenue loss by multiplying the yield loss by \nthe crop price and adding the extra nitrogen fertiliser applied. \nYLcw(sprayed fallow) = Areac × Area%sprayed × Ylcw × 0 .25\nWhere YLcw(sprayed fallow) represents sprayed fallow yield loss for crop \nc and weed w, Areac is the area of crop as per representative \nfarm, Area%sprayed is the proportion of sprayed area, Ylcw is the \nyield loss coefficient for weed w, and 0.25 denotes yield loss net \npercentage after spraying. \nYLcw(unsprayed fallow) = Areac × Area%unsprayed × Ylcw\nWhere YLcw(unsprayed fallow) represents unsprayed fallow yield loss for \ncrop c and weed w.\nRLylcw\n = YLcw(sprayed+unsprayed) × Prc\nWhere RLylcw\n represents revenue loss due to yield loss (t/ha) \nfor crop c and weed w, YLcw(sprayed+unsprayed) is the sprayed and \nunsprayed yield loss (tonnes) for crop c and weed w, and Prc \ndenotes crop price ($/t). \nCN = C(fert.) × N_replace(kg/ha) × Areaw\nWhere CN represents cost of extra N fertiliser, C(fert.) is the cost of N \n($ per kilogram), N_replace(kg/ha) is the amount of N to be replaced \nin kilograms per hectare (half of what was lost), and Areaw is the \narea of weed as per representative farm. \nThe fallow yield loss coefficient is based on the weed density and \narea of infestation surviving at the end of the fallow. Unlike the \nresidual weeds in-crop, the fallow yield loss coefficient is based \non weed density rather than a specific weed at a given density, \nand the model has used the $ummer Weed Tool (research.csiro.\nau/summer-weed-tool) (Oliver et al., 2021, 2022), derived from the \nAgricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), to estimate the \nfallow yield loss coefficients (Table 33). \nThe fallow yield loss coefficients represent the yield loss in \nthe subsequent crop due to changes in resources in the soil \nprofile (Osten et al., 2006; Hunt et al., 2011). To estimate this \ncoefficient, a comparison was made using APSIM-modelled yields \nat different weed densities with non-limiting N. To estimate the \nfallow yield loss, a subset of the tool’s outputs were used. The \nselected simulations included deep-rooted weeds to reflect \nthe root structure of the fallow weeds used in the model, while \nrepresenting low, medium and high weed densities. Different \nsoil types were represented for different regions, including clay \nsoil for Northern AEZs and duplex soil for Southern and Western \nAEZs. The simulations were run for wheat crops, and the yield \nloss for broadleaf crops (oilseed and pulse crops), sorghum and \ncotton were extrapolated from this. The yield loss coefficient for \nbroadleaf and sorghum crops was 0.5 that of wheat and for cotton \nwas 0.25 that of wheat. Other winter cereal crops had the same \ncoefficient as wheat.\nFallow weeds reduce soil water available to the subsequent \ncrop and reduce yields; however, loss of soil N also affects the \nsubsequent crop. The $ummer Weed Tool (Oliver et al., 2021, 2022) \nwas used to estimate the N used by fallow weeds (Table 33 –  \npage 41). Nitrogen use by summer fallow weeds often means \nthat initial available soil N levels are reduced and growers will \napply more early-season nitrogen, either guided by soil testing or \nintuitively based on paddock and crop observation. The model \ncalculates average revenue loss associated with fallow weeds  \nby considering both potential yield revenue losses due to reduced \nsoil water and the additional cost of applying extra  N, and is  \nbased on a large number of simulations from possible (historical) \nseason types. \nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n16\n2.2.2 Grain cleaning\nResidual weeds in crops can result in weed contamination and \ntherefore generate additional cleaning costs. Many participants \nconsulted in the advisory workshops suggested that growers \ngenerally clean grain before selling it rather than accepting a \ndowngrade, so the model only considers cleaning costs. The \naverage cost of crop cleaning is $43/t of grain; however, the \nproportion of crops that requires cleaning is generally low and \nvaries between AEZs (Table 43 – page 46). The model considers \ngrain cleaning for all crops excluding cotton as participants in the \nadvisory workshops confirmed that weed contamination in cotton \ncrops is very low. Costs are calculated for each representative \nfarm by:\nRLcleancw\n = Yc × Ccleanc\n × Cleaned%c  \nWhere RLcleancw\n represents revenue loss due to contamination for \ncrop c and weed w, Yc is the average yield (t/ha) for crop c, Ccleanc\n is \nthe grain cleaning cost ($/t) for crop c, and Cleaned%c denotes the \npercentage of crop cleaned. \n2.2.3 Off-target herbicide damage\nApplying herbicides may result in off-target application. This \ncan potentially damage crops, depending on the crop, growth \nstage, herbicide and rate. Off-target herbicide damage is a new \nintroduction to the 2025 model which now also includes cotton. \nThis damage is difficult to quantify and is conservatively assumed \nto only contribute to a small yield loss, despite being highly variable \nacross AEZs and crop types. For example, the area of off-target \ndamage (due to spray drift) varies with seasons. In the 2019, 2022 \nand 2023 CRDC growers surveys (Sparks, 2019, 2022, 2023), \n19, 22 and 48 per cent of growers, respectively, reported being \naffected by spray drift, with the 2022-23 season having particularly \nhigh levels. According to official spray drift reports published in \nCotton Australia annual reports, spray drift ranged from 9.5 per \ncent of the crop in 2018 to 0.31 per cent in 2022 (the annual report \ndid not publish the 2023 values). Cotton Australia annual reports \nsuggested that the damage caused was highly variable but could \nnot be quantified (Cotton Australia, 2019, 2020, 2021). The cotton \nindustries Crop Consultants Australia qualitative report collects \nlongitudinal data on on-farm practices and attitudes regarding the \nimpact of spray drift on yield. On average, across all years (2019 \nto 2023), eight per cent of cropping land reported less than 10 per \ncent yield reduction. Higher losses were reported in some years: \nin 2020, 2021 and 2023, three per cent of cropping land reported \nabout 10 to 20 per cent yield reduction, and in 2023, eight per cent \nof cropping land reported about 20 to 40 per cent yield reduction. \nDue to the highly variable nature and lack of data, the model has \nconservatively set no yield damage in wheat, barley and oat crops. \nBroadleaf and sorghum are assumed to have a 10 per cent yield \ndamage on one per cent of the cropping land, while cotton has  \n10 per cent yield damage on eight per cent of the cropping land. \nRLoff targetcw\n = ( Areac × Impact%c ) × Yc × Ydamage%c\nWhere RLoff targetcw\n represents revenue loss due to off-target \nherbicide damage for crop c and weed w, Impact%c is percentage of \ncrop impacted, and Ydamage%c\n denotes percentage of yield damaged. \n2.2.4 Weed control expenditure\nFarming practices associated with weed control are used in the \nmodel to calculate weed management expenditure. These include \nherbicide and non-herbicide practices used in-crop and during the \nfallow period, costs associated with seed technology, and a range \nof IWM practices, including ‘break’ crop choice where reduced \ncrop revenue is a result. \nThe model used herbicide inputs by crop type and AEZ for \nherbicide groupings, including fallow, knockdown, pre-emergent \nand post-emergent for every representative farm. Herbicide \ninput assumptions were derived from data from regional advisory \nworkshops, proprietary Kynetec annual herbicide farmer panels \ndata and regional annual crop input guides, and they were aligned \nwith available Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines \nAuthority (APVMA) national herbicide sales statistics (Table 41 \n– page 44). Kynetec data were sourced from Kynetec annual \nfarmer panels, and information was collected through a blended \napproach of farmer personal interviews and electronic data \ntransfer from spray diaries with a sample size of approximately \n10,000 farms. \nOther weed control measures considered in this study include the \nuse of seed technology (such as herbicide-tolerant GM crops) and \na range of IWM practices such as crop topping (in broadleaf and \ncereal crops), narrow windrow burning, seed milling, chaff lining \nand chaff tramlining, chaff cart, bale direct, tillage prior to sowing, \ndelayed seeding with knockdown, double knock, burning stubble \nfor weed control, the use of manure crops, competitive crop \nseeding and break crops and chipping in cotton crops. Where use \nand costs of a practice may not be entirely attributable to weed \ncontrol (for example, tillage prior to sowing, burning stubble for \nweed control and the technology fee for cotton varieties), only a \nproportion is attributed to weed control costs (Table 42 – page 45).\n2.2.5 In-crop herbicide costs\nHerbicides used and their costs for each AEZ and crop type \nare based on information gained from advisory workshops in \neach region, Kynetec data and gross margin guides (Tables 35 \nto 39 – pages 42 to 43). The model calculates in-crop herbicide \ncosts – based on the area of herbicide use, the number of \nherbicide applications, the cost per application, and the cost of \nother chemicals (including adjuvants) – in three herbicide groups \n(knockdown, pre-emergent and post-emergent) per representative \nfarm. Results are expressed as total value and per hectare value. \nNote that per hectare values presented are averages across all \nparticular crop hectares, including hectares that do not receive \nthat particular type of application each year. \nCHerbicide = Areacrh × Cherbcide/ha\nWhere CHerbicide represents herbicide cost, Areacrh is the crop area \nreceiving herbicide, and Cherbcide/ha denotes cost per hectare. \nCapplication = ( Applicationn × Capplication/pass) × Areacrh\nWhere Capplication represents application cost, Applicationn is \nthe number of applications, and Capplication/pass is the cost per \napplication pass. \nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n17\nBased on data from the grain advisory workshops, on average \n93 per cent of cropping land is assumed to receive knockdown \nherbicide, 87 per cent to receive pre-emergent herbicide and \n90 per cent to receive post-emergent herbicide. Herbicide \napplications in all three classes are higher in cotton crops, with 100 \nper cent of cotton cropping land receiving each of these herbicide \nclasses. Excluding application costs, average knockdown herbicide \ncosts $21/ha for cereal crops, $19/ha for broadleaf crops, $28/ha \nfor sorghum and $47/ha for cotton. The definition of knockdown \nprior to seeding and herbicide use in the fallow period can be \nhard to determine, and the timing of these herbicide applications is \nsubjective. For example, the AgEcon Cotton industry gross margins \n2018-19 guide (AgEcon, 2019) estimates knockdown at $45/ha and \nin the fallow period at $57/ha. In contrast, the 2025 weed model \ninputs knockdown at $78/ha and fallow at $46/ha. Pre-emergent \nherbicide costs $25/ha for cereal, $22/ha for broadleaf, $26/ha for \nsorghum and $41/ha for cotton, and post-emergent herbicide costs \n$20/ha for cereal, $18/ha for broadleaf, $25/ha for sorghum and \n$36/ha for cotton. \nThe number of herbicide applications varies between crop and \nherbicide class (Tables 35 to 39 – pages 42 to 45). Cereal crops \nreceive on average two herbicide applications for knockdown and \npost-emergent herbicide and one for pre-emergent herbicide. \nBroadleaf and sorghum crops also receive two herbicide \napplications for knockdown while on average only receive one \napplication of pre and post-emergent herbicides. Cotton receives \nmore applications, with an average of four knockdown applications \nand two pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicide applications. \nThe cost of application (excluding chemical costs) also varies with \ncrop type and AEZ but is generally $8/ha in grain crops. Application \ncosts in cotton are higher at $8/ha to $15/ha (AgEcon, 2019). \n2.2.6 Fallow herbicide costs\nLike in-crop herbicide use, the use and costs of fallow herbicides \nin each AEZ are based on information gained from advisory \nworkshops in each region and Kynetec data (Tables 35 to 40 \n– pages 42 to 44). The model calculates fallow herbicide costs \nbased on the area of herbicide use, the number of herbicide \napplications, the cost per application and the cost of the chemical \nper representative farm.\nCHerbicide = Areacrh × Cherbicide/ha\nWhere CHerbicide represents herbicide cost, Areacrh is the crop area \nreceiving herbicide, and Cherbcide/ha denotes cost per hectare. \nCapplication = ( Applicationn × Capplication/pass) × Areacrh\nWhere Capplication represents application cost, Applicationn is \nthe number of applications, and Capplication/pass is the cost per \napplication pass. \nOn average, 97 per cent of grain and 99 per cent of cotton land \narea receives some fallow herbicides. Average fallow herbicide \ncosts are $20/ha for grain crops and $46/ha for cotton. Grain \ncrops on average receive two fallow applications and cotton \nreceives three. On average, the cost of applying the herbicide is \n$8/ha in grain crops and $15/ha in cotton crops (AgEcon, 2019). \nThe use of precision spray application (for example, camera \nspraying) by some growers is incorporated in the average \nassumed application and herbicide costs (and also the cost \nof ‘doubleknock’ chemical application described under IWM \npractices in Section 2.2.7). Insufficient available data on the \nextent of use of camera sprayers and associated chemical use \nreductions prevents a more detailed breakdown.\n2.2.7 Integrated weed management \ncosts\nThe model considers a wide range of practices under the banner \nof IWM. The areas of IWM practice use per representative farm \nwere obtained from advisory workshops in each region, the \nGRDC FPS (for a subset of practices), and the Integrated pest \nmanagement guidelines for cotton production in Australia \n(Table 42 – page 45) (Deutscher, 2005). Advisory groups \nand annual input budgeting guides were used to inform cost \nassumptions (Table 42). When calculating the costs and benefits of \nthese practices, the model considers additional factors such as the \nlevel of attribution and yield loss associated with some practices. \nFor example, some benefits of IWM practices extend beyond \nweed control, so only a portion of the costs associated with these \npractices can be attributed to weed control. \nCiwm = Areaiwm × Ciwm/ha × Attributioniwm%weedcontrol\nWhere Ciwm represents the cost of a specific IWM practice, \nAreaiwm is the percentage of the crop area where the practice \nis used, Ciwm/ha is the cost of the practice per hectare, and \nAttributioniwm%weedcontrol is the percentage cost attributed to  \nweed management. \nYLiwmcw\n = Yc × Areaiwm × Ylcw × Prc\nWhere YLiwmcw\n represents the cost of a specific IWM practice from \nyield loss.\nAll other terms as defined above.\nHarvest weed seed control (HWSC) practices in the model include \nseed impact mills, chaff lining, chaff carts, chaff tramlining, bale \ndirect and narrow windrow burning. These practices aim to collect \nweed seeds at harvest, to either destroy them or deposit them in \na known location where they can be monitored and controlled. \nThese practices are only used on a small portion of cropping land, \ncommonly less than six per cent, although chaff tramlining is more \nwidely used in the northern region. \nOther IWM practices included in the model are crop topping in \nbroadleaf and cereal crops. These practices attract two costs, one \nassociated with reduced yield (two to five per cent of crop yield) \nand the other cost associated with implementing the practice  \n($14/ha to $16/ha). Delayed seeding with additional knockdown  \nis another practice that incurs an average yield penalty and cost  \nof implementing the practice (seven per cent of crop yield and \n$30/ha).\nDouble knockdown is another herbicide-based practice, typically \ninvolving two applications of herbicides sequentially. Conventional \ndouble knockdown practices often use a more expensive herbicide \nmix for the second pass, with many growers using paraquat; \nhowever, as camera spraying and similar targeted technology \nbecome more popular, the chemical cost associated with this \nsecond pass could be lower (detailed data of usage patterns are \nunavailable). As it is difficult to quantify the area of cropping land \nreceiving camera spraying and identify the associated herbicide \nuse, the model used a double knockdown treatment cost of \n$25/ha in grain crops (approximately 20 per cent higher than an \naverage knockdown application) and $30/ha in cotton. The double \nknockdown practice occurs on 12 to 73 per cent of cropping land in \ngrains (based on the GRDC FPS) and 25 per cent in cotton. \nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n18\nOther common practices in grain crops include competitive crop \nseeding and break crops specifically for weed management. \nCompetitive crop seeding occurs on 18 to 60 per cent of cropping \nland, based on GRDC FPS data, and is assumed to cost $15/ha. \nBreak crops for the predominant purpose of weed control occur \non 16 to 14 per cent of cropping land and cost $80/ha (based on \nforegone revenue relative to what would have been the optimal \ncrop choice in the absence of weed considerations). \nLess common practices include burning stubble, the use of \nmanure crops, and chipping in cotton. Burning stubble on average \noccurs only on three per cent of cropping land (not including \nnarrow windrow burning) and is assumed to cost $1/ha, of which \nonly a proportion is attributable to weed control. Manure crops \n(pulses) only occur in a few AEZs on a very small amount of \ncropping land and cost an average $213/ha (estimated revenue \nloss relative to growing and harvesting a pulse crop and including \nconsideration of improved yields in future crop/s). Chipping only \noccurs in around five per cent of cotton crops and costs $5/ha. \nAlthough tillage prior to sowing has become much less popular \nas growers have shifted to no-tillage systems (tillage was the only \nnon-herbicide weed control cost considered in the Jones et al. \n(2000) study, although more were included in the 2006 update), \nthis practice still occurs on four to 17 per cent of cropping land in \ngrains and 50 per cent in cotton with a cost of $40/ha to $50/ha. \nSoil amelioration techniques, such as spading or deep ripping, \nhave become more popular in recent years and, although these \npractices are not considered in this analysis, changes in the soil \nprofile may present new weed management challenges.\nIt is worth noting that not all IWM practices have been included \nin the revised model. Through the regional advisory workshops, \nadditional practices that may have a weed management impact \nwere identified, including grazing, haying, clay spreading, cover \ncrops and inter-row cropping in cotton crops. However, many \nof these practices are difficult to quantify and generate multiple \nbenefits to the enterprise, so they are not included. The model \nalso did not include a range of emerging IWM practices, such \nas camera-assisted herbicide spraying or green-on-green \ntechnology, due to the lack of available data for each AEZ.\n2.2.8 Seed technology costs\nSeed technology includes a wide range of practices which focus \non seed quality and crop growth, but the model only includes the \ncosts of herbicide-tolerant seed technology in canola and cotton \ncrops. While 100 per cent of cotton growers use seed technology, \nthe proportion of genetically modified (GM) canola grown varies \nbetween AEZs, ranging from seven to 80 per cent (Table 44 – \npage 47) (CRDC and CottonInfo, 2022, 2023; OGTR, 2021, 2024a, \n2024b, 2021; AEGIC, 2014; Zhang & Flottmann, 2016; Norton, \n2003; Kirkegaard et al., 2016). \nIn cotton, the model estimates the cost of seed technology from \nthe licence fee. This licence fee is based on Roundup Ready \nFlex® at $75/ha. Although other more expensive products such as \nBollard ($390/ha) are more popular with growers, these products \nperform both weed and insect control. \nThe seed technology costs included in the analysis for canola \nare a combination of licence fees and extra seed costs. This is \nbased on the South Australian Department of Primary Industries \nand Regions (PIRSA) gross margin guide for Roundup Ready® \ncanola compared to conventional canola ($26/ha). For canola, \nthe model also included a yield loss of two per cent, a crop price \nreduction of four per cent and a herbicide saving of $46/ha.\nESeedTechc = ( Yc × Ylcw × Prc ) + ( Cs × Areast ) + ( –CH × Areast )\nWhere ESeedTechc represents expenditures on seed technology, \nCs is the cost of seed technology,  Areast is the area where seed \ntechnology is used, and –CH is the cost herbicide savings.  ☐\nWIld radish in wheat.

These revenue losses are made up \nof yield loss in crops, yield loss from fallow weeds, revenue \nlosses from crop cleaning due to weed contamination in crops, \nand revenue loss from yield damage associated with off-target \nherbicide application. Revenue loss due to residual weeds in \nall grain crops and fallow is estimated at $512 million (Table 3). \nRevenue losses occurring from fallow weeds ($257 million) are \nestimated to be close to the revenue losses from residual weeds \nin crops ($255 million).\n3.1.1 Residual cropping weeds  \nin all grain crops \nRESIDUAL WEEDS IN ALL GRAIN CROPS \nRevenue loss caused by residual weeds in all grain crops (wheat, \nbarley, oats), canola, pulses and sorghum was estimated at $255 \nmillion or $12/ha (Table 4). Loss from residual weeds competing \nwith wheat crops was the highest at $139 million or $13/ha  \n(Table 48 – page 48 and Table 49 – page 49). T otal yield losses \nwere 0.81 million tonnes or 2.0 per cent of production. \nThe top residual weeds in all grain crops based on the area of \ninfestation, yield loss and revenue loss nationally are presented in \n(Table 5 and Table 6).

(2025) on the changing ecology and biology of \nkey weed species affecting Australian grains due to climate and \nsoil factors identified six priority weed species nationally: annual \nryegrass, fleabane, brome grass, sow thistle, wild radish and \nfeathertop Rhodes grass. This shows good agreement between \nthe priority weeds identified in the Bajwa study and the most \ncommonly found weeds (by area of infestation) identified by the \nnational weed impact model.\nThe most costly weeds vary by region (Tables 55 to 57 – pages 51 \nand 52). In the northern region the highest-ranked weeds based \non total revenue loss are sow thistle, wild oats and barnyard grass. \nIn the southern region these are ryegrass, brome grass and \nsow thistle, and in the western region they are ryegrass, brome \ngrass and wild radish. The revenue loss totals reflect the extent \n(crop area with the weed) and yield damage due to density and \ncompetitiveness factors. \nNote that the focus of the methodology is on primary ‘driver’ \nweeds, and the analysis did not aim to represent the individual \ncosts of each of the many weeds present in Australian cropping. \nA list of the wider range of weeds reported as present through \nthe 2020 national random paddock survey can be found in the \nappendices (Table 34 – page 41).\nTable 4: Grain yield loss and revenue loss due to residual weeds in all grain crops, expressed as total  \nand average per hectare, by region and agroecological zone .\nYield loss \n(t)\nRevenue loss \n($)\nYield loss per hectare \n(t/ha)\nRevenue loss per hectare \n($/ha)\nNorthern 187,781 57m 0.03 8.88\nQld Central 31,826 12m 0.11 41.3\nNSW NE / Qld SE 91,063 26m 0.05 14.45\nNSW NW / Qld SW 36,409 10m 0.04 10.38\nNSW Vic Slopes 19,181 7m 0.01 3.48\nNSW Central 9303 3m 0.01 1.80\nSouthern 330,681 96m 0.05 14.46\nSA Midnorth-Lower Yorke Eyre 116,340 33m 0.07 19.28\nSA Vic Mallee 109,622 32m 0.04 11.34\nSA Vic Bordertown-Wimmera 85,690 26m 0.05 14.15\nTasmania Grain 770 248k 0.09 28.04\nVic High Rainfall 18,259 6m 0.05 17.08\nWestern 290,378 102m 0.04 12.59\nWA Central 161,867 59m 0.04 13.75\nWA Eastern 51,018 17m 0.04 13.59\nWA Northern 43,954 15m 0.03 9.91\nWA Sandplain/Mallee 33,539 11m 0.03 10.41\nTotal 808,840 255m 0.04 12.05\nSource: CSIRO\nTable 5: Area of residual weeds in all grain crops, winter cereals, broadleaf crops (oilseed and pulse)  \nand sorghum .\nRank\nGrain crops Winter cereal Broadleaf crops Sorghum\nWeed Area (ha) Weed Area (ha) Weed Area (ha) Weed Area (ha)\n1 Ryegrass 15,520,195 Ryegrass 12,502,436 Ryegrass 3,017,760 Feathertop Rhodes grass 163,942\n2 Wild radish 6,559,497 Wild radish 4,760,387 Wild radish 1,799,110 Barnyard grass 156,047\n3 Brome grass 4,392,853 Brome grass 3,989,120 Sow thistle 1,002,774 Fleabane 155,004\n4 Sow thistle 3,183,960 Wild oats 3,070,184 Wild turnip 693,324 Sweet summer grass 38,079\n5 Wild oats 3,116,226 Sow thistle 2,181,186 Brome grass 403,733\n6 Wild turnip 1,193,070 Barley grass 1,019,516 Brassica weeds 273,549\n7 Barley grass 1,019,516 Fleabane 649,609 Fleabane 146,953\n8 Fleabane 951,567 Wild turnip 499,747 Vetches 128,368\n9 Brassica weeds 273,549 Feathertop Rhodes grass 62,476 Blue lupins 112,739\n10 Feathertop Rhodes grass 257,934 Wild oats 46,042\n11 Barnyard grass 156,047 Feathertop Rhodes grass 31,517\n12 Vetches 128,368\n13 Blue lupins 112,739\n14 Sweet summer grass 38,079\nSource: CSIRO\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n21\nTable 6: Top residual weeds, yield loss and revenue loss in all grain crops, winter cereals, broadleaf crops \n(oilseeds and pulses) and sorghum nationally . \nRank\nGrain  Winter cereal Broadleaf crops Sorghum\nWeed\nYield loss (t)\nWeed\nRevenue loss ($)\nWeed\nYield loss (t)\nWeed\nRevenue loss ($)\nWeed\nYield loss (t)\nWeed\nRevenue loss ($)\nWeed\nYield loss (t)\nWeed\nRevenue loss ($)\n1 Ryegrass 289,712 Ryegrass  93m Ryegrass 219,842 Ryegrass 66m Ryegrass 69,870 Ryegrass 26m Barnyard \ngrass 27,426 Barnyard \ngrass 8m\n2 Brome \ngrass 130,198 Brome \ngrass 42m Brome \ngrass 119,966 Brome \ngrass 36m Wild \nradish 22,030 Wild \nradish 11m\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n15,375\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n5m\n3 Sow \nthistle 124,371 Sow \nthistle 37m Sow \nthistle 113,753 Sow \nthistle 32m Wild \nturnip 14,004 Brome \ngrass 5m\nSweet \nsummer \ngrass\n5678\nSweet \nsummer \ngrass\n2m\n4 Wild oats 86,106 Wild \nradish 28m Wild oats 85,924 Wild oats 24m Sow \nthistle 10,618 Sow \nthistle 5m Fleabane 941 Fleabane 293k\n5 Wild \nradish 75,298 Wild oats 24m Wild \nradish 53,268 Wild \nradish 17m Brome \ngrass 10,231 Wild \nturnip 4m\n6 Wild \nturnip 32,351 Wild \nturnip 10m Wild \nturnip 18,347 Barley \ngrass 6m Vetches 1,659 Blue \nlupins 451k\n7 Barnyard \ngrass 27,426 Barnyard \ngrass 8m Barley \ngrass 17,899 Wild \nturnip 5m Blue \nlupins 949 Vetches 368k\n8 Barley \ngrass 17,899 Barley \ngrass 6m\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n369\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n124k\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n286\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n182k\n9\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n16,030\nFeathertop \nRhodes \ngrass\n5m Fleabane 189 Fleabane 50k\n10\nSweet \nsummer \ngrass\n5678\nSweet \nsummer \ngrass\n2m Wild oats 182 Wild oats 33k\n11 Vetches 1659 Blue \nlupins 451k\n12 Fleabane 1161 Vetches 368k\n13 Blue \nlupins 949 Fleabane 351k\nSource: CSIRO\nRESIDUAL WEEDS IN WINTER CEREALS\nTotal yield loss due to weeds in winter cereal was estimated at \n0.63 million tonnes, resulting in a revenue loss of $187 million \n(Table 48 – page 48) or $11/ha (Table 49 – page 49). This \nrepresents a revenue loss of $11/ha of winter cereal cropping \nland in the western region, $15/ha in the southern region and  \n$7/ha in the northern region. Low and medium weed densities \nwere commonly reported for residual weeds in winter cereals \n(Table 50 – page 49).\nThe top residual weeds in winter cereals, based on the national \narea of infestation and associated yield loss and revenue loss, are \npresented in Table 5 and Table 6. The top weeds include winter \ngrasses such as annual ryegrass, brome grass and wild oats. \nOther weeds include sow thistle and wild radish. In the Southern \nand Western AEZs, annual ryegrass was the costliest weed in \nwinter cereal crops, while sow thistle was the costliest in the \nnorthern region (Tables 55 to 57 – pages 51 and 52).\nRESIDUAL WEEDS IN CANOLA AND PULSES \nTotal yield loss due to weeds in canola and pulses was estimated \nat 0.13 million tonnes, resulting in a revenue loss of $53 million. \nMost of the losses were in the southern and western regions \n(Table 51 – page 50). Nationally, revenue losses were $13/ha of \nbroadleaf crops (Table 52 – page 50). Residual weeds in canola \nand pulses, mainly annual ryegrass and wild radish, were most \ncommonly reported at low weed densities (Table 53 – page 51), \nresulting in relatively low yield losses (Table 5 and Table 6). \nRESIDUAL WEEDS IN SORGHUM \nResidual weeds in sorghum were found to cause a loss of $15 \nmillion in the northern region (Table 54 – page 51). The most \nimportant weeds in terms of revenue loss were barnyard grass, \nfeathertop Rhodes grass and sweet summer grass (Table 5 and \nTable 6). As for other residual weeds in crops, residual weeds in \nsorghum are commonly reported at low (56 per cent) and medium \n(44 per cent) densities.\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n22\n3.1.2 Fallow weeds\nYield loss due to weeds in fallow was estimated at 0.36 million \ntonnes, resulting in a revenue loss of $107 million (Table 7). The \nadditional fertiliser costs associated with fallow weeds were \nestimated at $150 million, taking the total to $257 million ($12/ha). \nMost fallow weeds were reported in low densities on average \n(Table 8). This average includes some seasons where there are \nextremely few summer weeds due to low summer rainfall. The \ntop weeds in fallow based on national area of infestation and \nassociated yield loss and revenue loss are presented in Table 9. \nNationally, the top-ranked weeds based on revenue losses were \nmelons, heliotrope / potato weed and fleabane. \nThe ranking of weeds by revenue losses varied by region  \n(Table 62 – page 56). The most costly weeds were panic grass, \nheliotrope / potato weed and melons in the northern region; \nheliotrope / potato weed, melons and fleabane in the  \nsouthern region; and fleabane, melons and caltrop/bindi  \nin the western region.\nTable 7: Fallow weeds result for yield loss and revenue loss, expressed as total value and per hectare, \nby region and agroecological zone .\nYield loss \n(t)\nYield loss  \nper hectare \n(t/ha)\nRevenue loss due \nto fallow weeds \n(soil water) ($)\nFertiliser cost due \nto fallow weeds \n($)\nTotal fallow  \nweed costs \n($)\nFallow weed costs \nper hectare \n($/ha)\nNorthern 166,123 0.03 49m 52m 101m 15.69\nQld Central 1425 0 556k 518k 1m 3.74\nNSW NE / Qld SE 17,094 0.01 5m 6m 11m 6.05\nNSW NW / Qld SW 4329 0 1m 2m 3m 2.84\nNSW Vic Slopes 74,560 0.04 23m 24m 46m 24.62\nNSW Central 68,715 0.05 20m 20m 40m 26.62\nSouthern 114,809 0.02 33m 46m 79m 11.89\nSA Midnorth-Lower Yorke Eyre 20,423 0.01 6m 8m 14m 8.13\nSA Vic Mallee 56,047 0.02 16m 22m 38m 13.78\nSA Vic Bordertown-Wimmera 34,053 0.02 10m 14m 24m 13.18\nTasmania Grain 106 0.01 34k 40k 74k 8.38\nVic High Rainfall 4180 0.01 1m 2m 3m 8.46\nWestern 78,223 0.01 25m 51m 77m 9.52\nWA Central 35,308 0.01 12m 23m 35m 8.11\nWA Eastern 13,222 0.01 4m 9m 13m 10.45\nWA Northern 13,216 0.01 5m 9m 13m 8.82\nWA Sandplain/Mallee 16,478 0.02 5m 11m 16m 15.37\nTotal 359,156 0.02 107m 150m 257m 12.14\nYield loss is due to soil water, while total revenue loss is due to yield loss and extra fertiliser.

Cleaning costs \ncontribute to one per cent of the total weed cost (yield loss \nand expenditure cost) and eight per cent of all yield loss costs, \nreflecting the low frequency of cleaning. \nThe results show major differences between regions with cleaning \ncosting an average of $3/ha in AEZs in the northern region, $2/ha in \nthe southern region and $1/ha in the western region. Note that the \ncost does not account for seed cleaning for retained crop seed as \nit was assumed that some cleaning process would still be required \nfor reasons other than weed removal.\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n23\n3.2  Expenditure costs due to \nweeds in grain crops\nNationally, weed control expenditure in grain crops makes up most \nof the total weed cost at $3732 million (Table 11) or $176/ha. This \nrepresents 87 per cent of all weed-related costs (grain yield loss \nand weed control expenditure) (Figure 5). All regions were found to \nspend similar amounts to control weeds in grain crops (Figure 6).\nExpenditure in grain crops is broken down into costs of individual \ncontrol measures, including in-crop herbicides, fallow herbicides, \nIWM and seed technology. Most expenditure costs arise from in-\nseason herbicide use, with IWM practices being next largest cost \n(some of which include herbicide use such as crop topping for \nweed seed control).

These practices were found to cost $1072 million \nnationally (Table 14) or $51/ha. Growers in the western region \ninvested the most in these practices at $461 million ($57/ha). The \ntop three IWM practices in terms of cost were break crops (which \nreduced revenue in that season due to weed control), double \nknockdown and crop topping. These practices accounted for 42, \n19 and 12 per cent of the total IWM costs, respectively. \nUse of HWSC practices that aim to control weed seeds at harvest \ncontributed only a relatively small total cost of $34 million nationally. \nHowever, data on the on-farm extent and intensity of use of these \npractices by users were limited, so conservative estimates were \nused (Table 14, Table 42 – page 45 and Table 78 – page 64). Crop \ntopping resulted in a total costs of $133 million (Table 14) or an \naverage of $6/ha (Table 14). Like crop topping, delayed seeding \nwith knockdown and double knockdown are herbicide-based IWM \npractices. Double knockdown costs $201 million (Table 14) and is \none of the most widely used IWM practices (Table 70 – page 61). \nOther major IWM practices in grain crops are break crops and \ncompetitive crop seeding specifically for weed management. \nNationally, break crops for the purpose of weed control cost  \n$452 million and competitive crop seeding (primarily for weed \ncontrol) costs $106 million (Table 14 and Table 70 – page 61). \nGrain growers are still investing in some tillage for weed control \npurposes despite the general shift to no-tillage. Nationally, the \nmodel estimates this cost at $85 million (Table 14 and Table 70 – \npage 61), with northern growers investing more in this practice. \nOnly a small proportion of whole-paddock stubble burning \nattributable to weed control occurs, and this is also assumed \nto be a low-cost practice. Narrow windrow burning is treated \nseparately. Manuring of crops was estimated to cost $3 million \n(Table 14 and Table 71 – page 61) and is treated separately to break \ncrops for weed control purposes. Hay crops for the purpose of \nweed control were not included in the costs as most estimates \nindicated that these were generally being used for non-weed \nreasons (mainly frost or as a profitable crop choice). \n3.3  Summary of cost of weeds  \nin grain crops\nThe total cost of weeds to Australian grain growers was estimated \nto be $4289 million ($203/ha). This cost was partly underpinned \nby grain yield losses of 1.2 million tonnes (three per cent of \nproduction) mainly due to in-crop and fallow weeds (Table 15). \nExpenditure on weed control ($3732 million or $176/ha) far \nexceeds revenue loss from the presence of weeds ($558 million \nor $26/ha). Although some costs vary between AEZs (and rainfall \nzones), the northern, western and southern regions were found to \nincur similar total weed control costs ($202/ha to $204/ha). \nThe average revenue loss of $26/ha is lower than the cost of \nmany herbicide treatment options, particularly when considering \nit includes yield losses from both residual in-crop weed control \nand fallow weeds. From an economic marginal cost–benefit \nperspective, the optimal level of weed control occurs when the \nmarginal benefit of investing in an additional unit of weed control \nno longer outweighs the marginal cost. When both the short-term \n(current-season) yield benefits and the long-term advantages \nof reducing the weed seed bank are taken into account, the \neconomically optimal weed density is often very low (Jones & \nMedd, 2000; Monjardino et al., 2005). The relatively low yield loss \nfrom in-crop weeds and the reported typically low weed densities \nalign with the idea that growers are aiming to maintain low in-\ncrop weed densities, reflecting a long-term, ‘seedbank aware’, \neconomically optimal strategy. \nNationally, the costliest residual weeds in all grain crops are annual \nryegrass ($93 million), brome grass ($42 million) and sow thistle ($37 \nmillion) (Table 6 – page 21). This is primarily due to the widespread \npresence of these weeds in crops across multiple AEZs. Yield loss \nin all grain crops from competition with annual ryegrass (289,712t) \nreduced grain production by 0.7 per cent of total grain production, \nwhile brome grass caused yield losses of 130,198t and sow thistle \n124,371t (Table 6 – page 21). Annual ryegrass and brome grass \ncontinue to be the costliest weeds in Australian winter cereals. \nBarnyard grass is the costliest weed in sorghum. Nationally, the \ncostliest weeds in fallow in terms of total revenue loss were melons, \nheliotrope / potato weed, and fleabane (Table 9 – page 23). \nAgain, this is primarily driven by the extent of the occurrence of \nthese weeds rather than just their relative level of herbicide use or \nparticularly high weed densities (when present). \nTable 14: Total and individual costs of integrated weed management practices, nationally and by  \ngrain-growing region .\nTotal IWM ($)\nBreak crops ($)\nDouble knock ($)\nCrop topping ($)\nCompetitive crop \nseeding ($)\nTillage prior to \nsowing ($)\nDelayed seeding \nwith knockdown ($)\nSeed milling ($)\nBale direct ($)\nChaff, lining and \nChaff tramlining ($)\nChaff cart ($)\nManure crops ($)\nNarrow windrow \nburning ($)\nBurn stubble ($)\nNorthern 294m 131m 50m 23m 28m 35m 19m 2m 2m 3m 385k 795k 739k 118k\nSouthern 316m 148m 45m 45m 29m 25m 14m 4m 3m 885k 1m 1m 573k 80k\nWestern 461m 173m 106m 65m 50m 25m 24m 7m 3m 4m 3m 601k 845k 144k\nTotal 1072m 452m 201m 133m 106m 85m 57m 12m 9m 7m 4m 3m 2m 342k\nPer hectare average 50.68 21.38 9.48 6.31 5.02 4.02 2.68 0.58 0.42 0.35 0.20 0.13 0.10 0.02\nSource: CSIRO\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n27\nThe study estimates $611 million is spent on fallow weed control \ncompared with $749 million on pre-emergent and $632 million  \non post-emergent herbicides for in-crop control. A further  \n$672 million is spent on knockdown herbicide treatments, some \nof which may also be controlling fallow weeds as well as newly \nemerged cropping season weeds. Based on the reported \ndensities of mature fallow weeds, weeds in fallows are estimated \nto cost more than $107 million through reduced crop yields and \n$150 million due to extra fertiliser applied, totalling $257 million.\nThe average costs of weed control, including herbicide and \nnon-herbicide practices, was $176/ha (Table 15). Herbicide-based \npractices during the growing season and during the fallow \nperiod constitute the majority of the expenditure costs. However, \ninvestment in practices classifiable as IWM are still substantial \n($51/ha) with the highest costs on IWM occurring in the western \nregion ($57/ha). Note that this analysis does not account for some \nfarming system changes and innovations that offer non-herbicide \nweed control benefits, such as greater crop competitiveness due \nto better establishment technology, soil amelioration and more \nrapid crop competition when sowing earlier into warmer soils. \nThis is because these practices also offer crop profit benefits for \nreasons other than weed control, so no cost or revenue loss can \nbe directly attributed to weed control. \nThe results of the analysis demonstrate that Australian grain \ngrowers are investing heavily in weed control and, by doing so, \nare keeping the cost of yield loss relatively low. This is likely to \nalso reflect the value gained from pursuing low-weed seedbanks \nand the cropping system flexibility that it facilitates. It also \nhighlights that the greatest opportunity to reduce the impact of \nweeds on grain production lies in the ability to maintain, or even \nimprove, weed control while implementing a more cost-effective \nsuite of practices and innovations.   ☐\nTable 15: Total cost of weeds in Australia, expressed as a total and per hectare, by region  \nand agroecological zone . \n \nTotal yield \nloss \n(t)\n \nTotal revenue \nloss \n($)\nTotal weed \ncontrol \nexpenditure \n($)\n \n \nTotal costs \n($)\n \nYield loss per \nhectare \n(t/ha)\n \nRevenue loss \nper hectare \n($/ha)\nWeed control \nexpenditure per \nhectare \n($/ha)\n \nTotal costs \nper hectare \n($/ha)\nNorthern  356.2k  180m  1134m  1314m 0.06 28 177 204\nQld Central  33.5k  14m  41m  55m 0.12 49 143 191\nNSW NE / Qld SE  109.2k  48m  332m  380m 0.06 27 185 212\nNSW NW / Qld SW  40.9k  16m  187m  203m 0.04 17 194 210\nNSW Vic Slopes  94.3k  56m  336m  392m 0.05 30 178 208\nNSW Central  78.2k  44m  238m  283m 0.05 30 160 190\nSouthern  447.5k  189m  1159m  1348m 0.07 28 174 202\nSA Midnorth-Lower Yorke Eyre  137.4k  50m  272m  322m 0.08 29 160 189\nSA Vic Mallee  166.0k  74m  486m  560m 0.06 26 174 201\nSA Vic Bordertown-Wimmera  120.6k  53m  335m  388m 0.07 29 185 214\nTasmania Grain  0.9k  414k  2m  2m 0.1 47 188 235\nVic High Rainfall  22.7k  11m  64m  76m 0.06 33 183 216\nWestern  370.6k  189m  1438m  1628m 0.05 23 178 202\nWA Central  198.2k  98m  783m  881m 0.05 23 182 205\nWA Eastern  64.3k  31m  210m  241m 0.05 25 168 193\nWA Northern  57.7k  30m  251m  281m 0.04 20 167 187\nWA Sandplain/Mallee  50.4k  31m  194m  225m 0.05 30 190 220\nTotal  1.2m  558m  3732m  4289m 0.06 26 176 203\nSource: CSIRO\nRyegrass in canola.

These revenue losses are made up of yield loss from \nfallow weeds ($4.3 million) and revenue loss from yield damage \nassociated with off-target herbicide application ($15 million). Based \non reported weed densities, revenue loss from residual weeds  \nare assumed to be negligible in cotton crops as weeds in this \nhigh-value crop are typically managed with near-zero in-crop \ntolerance and result in little yield damage.\n4.1.1  Residual cropping and fallow weeds \nin cotton\nRevenue losses caused by residual weeds in cotton crops are \nestimated to result in no measurable yield losses as all weeds \nthat were identified in the advisory workshop occur at very low \ndensities. The most extensive residual weeds in cotton crops are \nfleabane, barnyard grass and sow thistle (Table 16).\nThe total revenue loss due to fallow weeds in cotton paddocks is \n$4.3 million or $13/ha (Table 17). This comprises yield loss due to \nfallow weeds ($3.9 million) and additional fertiliser costs associated \nwith weeds during this period ($0.45 million). Most fallow weeds \noccur at low densities, and the most extensive fallow weeds are \nsow thistle, wild turnip and wild oats. The costliest are heliotrope / \npotato weed, windmill grass and wild turnip (Table 16).\n4.1.2  Crop cleaning and off-target \nherbicide damage in cotton\nCrop cleaning and docking (downgrades) are uncommon in \ncotton crops. Therefore, the costs associated with these have not \nbeen included in the model. Off-target herbicide application can \ndamage crops, reducing yield. This is attributable to the ‘cost of \nweeds’, for example, the cost of a weed control practice that also \nreduces crop yield. As for grain crops, in the absence of more \ndetailed available data, the model has conservatively estimated \nthe revenue loss. In-crop off-target herbicide damage is estimated \nto be $15 million ($45/ha).\n4 Results: cotton\nTable 16: Rankings of residual weeds in cotton crops (by area of land) and fallow weeds in cotton \npaddocks (by area of land, yield loss and revenue loss) .\nRank\nResidual weeds Fallow weeds\nWeed\nArea \n(ha) Weed\nArea \n(ha) Weed\nYield loss \n(t) Weed\nRevenue \nloss\n1 Fleabane 159,787 Sow thistle 195,329 Heliotrope / potato weed 378 Heliotrope / potato weed  $1m\n2 Barnyard grass 81,401 Wild turnip 129,397 Sow thistle 320 Wild turnip  $686k\n3 Sow thistle 33,484 Wild oats 96,773 Wild turnip 216 Windmill grass  $622k\n4 Feathertop Rhodes grass 18,627 Heliotrope / potato weed 59,551 Windmill grass 197 Wild oats  $266k\n5 Sesbania 1691 Melons 59,551 Melons 150 Sow thistle  $58k\n6 Windmill grass 35,730 Wild oats 84 Feathertop Rhodes grass  $31k\n7 Fleabane 21,189 Fleabane 18\n8 Feathertop Rhodes grass 10,872 Feathertop Rhodes grass 9\nSource: CSIRO\nTable 17: Losses due to fallow weeds in cotton paddocks by agroecological zone .\nTotal yield loss (t) Total fallow weed costs ($) Revenue loss per hectare ($/ha)\nNorthern 1373  4.3m 13.30\nQld Central 43  143k 5.92\nNSW NE / Qld SE 553  2m 8.80\nNSW NW / Qld SW 51  162k 3.81\nNSW Central 725  2m 38.15\nSource: CSIRO\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n29\n4.2  Weed control expenditure  \nin cotton\nSimilar to grain crops, expenditure on weed control in cotton \ncontributed to the majority of the total weed cost. Expenditure \ncosts in cotton are $126 million or on average $387/ha, as seen \nin Figure 7 (expenditure costs in cotton make up 87 per cent of \nthe total weed costs in cotton). Most of these costs are incurred \nthrough herbicide use, primarily from in-season use followed \nby fallow herbicide use. The total cost of weed control in cotton \nincludes costs of in-season herbicide ($66 million or 53 per cent of \nexpenditure cotton costs), fallow herbicide costs ($26 million or 21 \nper cent), net seed technology costs attributable to weed control \n($24 million or 19 per cent) and integrated weed management \npractices ($9 million or 7 per cent) (Table 19). As for grain crops, \nsome other crop management practices also contribute to weed \ncontrol and could be classified as IWM. However, they are not \nrepresented as a weed control cost here as they are profitable \npractices for reasons other than weed control, for example, \npractices relating to soil health.\n4.2.1 Herbicide use in cotton\nCROPPING SEASON AND FALLOW PERIOD\nCosts for knockdown, pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicide \ntreatments, including application, are estimated at $66 million \n($203/ha) (Table 20).

The pre-seeding knockdown costs may partially \ncapture some costs not represented in the fallow weed control \ncosts. Costs of post-emergent herbicides ($48/ha) and pre-\nemergent herbicides ($42/ha) were similar.\nHerbicide weed control in fallow incurs a total cost of $26 million \n($80/ha), of which $12 million is the herbicide and $14 million is the \napplication costs (Table 21).\n4.2.2  Integrated weed management \npractices in cotton\nFewer IWM practices are available for use in cotton crops than \nin grains. IWM practices include tillage prior to seeding, double \nknockdown specifically for weed control, and chipping. These \npractices make up a relatively small proportion of the overall cost \nof weeds (loss and expenditure) at 7 per cent. In cotton crops, IWM \npractices cost $9 million ($28/ha) (Table 22). Tillage prior to sowing \nis the costliest IWM practice at $7 million ($20/ha) – 80 per cent of \nthe total cost of this practice was attributed to weed control and/or \nIWM. Double knockdown cost $2 million ($8/ha). \n4.2.3 Seed technology in cotton\nAlmost 100 per cent of cotton crops use seed technology, and \na wide range of available products include both insect pest and \nweed control features. The model only considers the technology \nfee that may be attributable to weed control. This is estimated at \n$24 million ($75/ha).\n4.3  Summary of cost of weeds  \nin cotton \nWeeds cost cotton growers $145 million ($445/ha) in revenue \nlosses and expenditure costs (Table 23). Weeds in cotton crops \nare very well managed and result in minimal yield losses from \nin-crop competition. Yield losses mainly occur from weeds in the \nfallow period, and this modest yield loss is 0.14 million tonnes or \n0.4 per cent of cotton production. Cotton growers are investing \nheavily in controlling their weeds, mainly through herbicide \nuse. Although the model has attempted to separate the cost of \nherbicide-resistant seed technology from other weed costs, seed \ntechnology is an extensively used and integral part of a complete \ncotton farming system. In the absence of weed seed control \npractices, there are relatively few non-herbicide IWM practices to \naccount for in the cotton system.  ☐\nTable 22: Costs of integrated weed management practices in cotton by agroecological zone .\nTotal integrated weed \nmanagement ($)\nDouble knock \n($)\nTillage prior to sowing \n($)\nChipping \n($)\nNorthern  9m  2m  7m  81k\nQld Central  670k  181k  483k  6k\nNSW NE / Qld SE  6m  1m  4m  50k\nNSW NW / Qld SW  1m  318k  848k  11k\nNSW Central  2m  447k  1m  15k\nSource: CSIRO\nTable 23: The cost of weeds in Australian cotton, expressed as total and average per hectare,  \nby agroecological zone .\nRevenue loss \n($ million)\nExpenditure \n($ million)\nTotal costs \n($ million)\nRevenue loss per \nhectare ($/ha)\nExpenditure per \nhectare ($/ha)\nTotal costs per \nhectare ($/ha)\nNorthern  18.9  125.9  144.8 58 387 445\nQld Central  1.2  10.3  11.5 48 427 475\nNSW NE / Qld SE  9.3  75.1  84.4 47 376 423\nNSW NW / Qld SW  2.5  15.5  18.0 59 366 425\nNSW Central 99  25.0  30.9  5.9 99 419\nSource: CSIRO\nTable 21: Fallow herbicide cost in cotton by agroecological zone .\nFallow herbicide \ncosts \n($ million)\nFallow herbicide \napplication costs \n($ million)\nTotal fallow herbicide \ncosts \n($ million)\nFallow herbicide \ncosts per hectare \n($/ha)\nFallow herbicide \napplication costs per \nhectare ($/ha)\nTotal fallow herbicide \ncosts per hectare \n($/ha)\nNorthern  12  14  26 38 43 80\nQld Central  1  1  2 57 45 102\nNSW NE / Qld SE  6  9  15 30 43 74\nNSW NW / Qld SW  1  2  3 34 47 81\nNSW Central  3  2  6 58 35 93\nSource: CSIRO\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n31\n5.1 Total cost of weeds\nOverall, the cost of weeds to Australian grain and cotton growers \nwas estimated at $4.4 billion ($206/ha). This includes the loss of \n1.2 million tonnes in crop production (Table 24). The AEZs in the \nnorthern region bear the highest weed costs at an average  \n$216/ha, while AEZs in the southern and western regions  \nincurred an average $202/ha in costs.\n5.2  Yield and revenue losses due \nto weeds in grain and cotton\nTotal revenue losses from weeds were $576 million ($27/ha), \nunderpinned by yield losses of 1.2 million tonnes of grain and \ncotton (three per cent of total crop production) (Table 24). Crop \nyield and revenue losses result from two main sources: in-crop \nresidual weeds and fallow weeds. AEZs in the western region \nhad the lowest average revenue loss ($23/ha) compared to the \nnorthern and southern regions ($29/ha and $28/ha, respectively) \n(Table 77 – page 64).\nLow in-crop weed densities from effective weed control result in \nrelatively low yield losses amounting to two per cent of production \n(808,840t). In-crop residual weeds are defined as weeds found \nlate in the season close to harvest time. We assume that weeds \nthat are present and controlled early in the season have minimal \nimpact on yields. Yield losses from fallow weeds were even lower \nat 360,528t (one per cent of total production). The revenue losses \nassociated with fallow weeds were driven by both yield loss and \nN uptake with the cost of N replacement contributing to more than \nhalf of the total costs of fallow weeds. \n5 Results: grain and cotton crops\nTable 24: Cost of weeds from yield losses and weed control expenditure in grain and cotton combined, \nexpressed as total and average per hectare, by region and agroecological zone .\n \n \nYield loss \n(t)\n \n \nRevenue loss \n($)\n \n \nExpenditure \n($ million)\n \nTotal cost of \nweeds \n($ million)\n \nYield loss per \nhectare \n(t/ha)\n \nRevenue loss \nper hectare \n($/ha)\n \nExpenditure \nper hectare \n($/ha)\nTotal cost of \nweeds per \nhectare \n($/ha)\nNorthern 362,736  198m 1260 1458 0.05 29 187 216\nQld Central 33,930  15m 51 67 0.11 49 165 213\nNSW NE / Qld SE 112,441  58m 407 465 0.06 29 204 233\nNSW NW / Qld SW 41,814  19m 203 221 0.04 18 201 219\nNSW Vic Slopes 94,333  56m 336 392 0.05 30 178 208\nNSW Central 80,218  50m 263 314 0.05 33 170 203\nSouthern 447,545  18m 1159 1348 0.07 28 174 202\nSA Midnorth-Lower Yorke Eyre 137,418  50m 272 322 0.08 29 160 189\nSA Vic Mallee 165,952  7m 486 560 0.06 26 174 201\nSA Vic Bordertown-Wimmera 120,632  53m 335 388 0.07 29 185 214\nTasmania Grain 878  414k 2 2 0.1 47 188 235\nVic High Rainfall 22,665  11m 64 76 0.06 33 183 216\nWestern 370,572  189m 1438 1628 0.05 23 178 202\nWA Central 198,180  98m 783 881 0.05 23 182 205\nWA Eastern 64,324  31m 210 241 0.05 25 168 193\nWA Northern 57,656  30m 251 281 0.04 20 167 187\nWA Sandplain/Mallee 50,413  31m 194 225 0.05 30 190 220\nTotal 1,180,853  576m 3857 4434 0.05 27 180 206\nSource: CSIRO\nRevenue loss 13%Expenditure 87%\nFigure 8: Revenue loss (from yield losses) and \nexpenditure in grain and cotton as percentage of \ntotal weed-related costs* . \nSource: CSIRO\n*Revenue loss averages $27/ha and expenditure costs average $180/ha.\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n32\nThe result is that revenue losses from weeds in-crop and weeds \nin fallow are similar at $11.87/ha and $12.16/ha, respectively. Yield \nlosses from residual weeds in all crops led to losses of $255 \nmillion (44 per cent of total revenue yield loss), while revenue loss \nassociated with fallow weeds was $261 million (45 per cent). Due \nto well-controlled weeds in cotton crops, no cleaning or docking \nfees occur; however, off-target herbicide damage occurs in \nboth crop types. Revenue yield losses from grain cleaning costs \nare $43 million (eight per cent of revenue loss), while off-target \nherbicide damage is $17 million (three per cent).\n5.3  Weed control expenditure  \nin grain and cotton\nExpenditure on weed control in grain and cotton crops combined \nwas $3857 million ($180/ha), reflecting growers’ large investment in \ncontrolling weeds and maintaining low weed densities (Table 24). \nThis expenditure is 87 per cent of the total weed cost. Growers in \nthe northern region spent the most on weed control ($187/ha), and \ngrowers in the southern region spent the least ($174/ha). \nMost expenditure was on herbicide use in-season followed by \nIWM practices. Nationally, weed control expenditure in grain \nand cotton crops is made up of herbicide use in-season at \n$2120 million (which includes chemical costs of $1333 million \nand application costs of $787 million), herbicide use in fallow at \n$637 million (which includes chemical costs of $370 million and \napplication costs of $268 million) and IWM practices ($1081 million). \nGrain growers invest more in IWM practices, while cotton growers \ninvest heavily in seed technology, reflecting the farming systems \nand management choices available in each cropping system.\nNationally, IWM practices cost $50/ha, with growers in the western \nregion spending the most. Of the IWM practices considered in \nthe model, breakcrops were the costliest at $452 million ($21/ha) \nfollowed by double knockdown at $203 million ($9/ha), crop \ntopping at $133 million ($6/ha), competitive crop seeding for weed \ncontrol $106 million ($5/ha), tillage prior to seeding for weed \ncontrol $91 million ($4/ha) and delayed seeding with knockdown \n$57 million ($3/ha).\nGrain and cotton growers are investing heavily in herbicide-based \nweed control. The combined in-crop and fallow herbicide costs \nare $2757 million ($128/ha), which includes chemical costs and \napplication. Cotton growers are spending $284/ha on herbicides \nand application. The model splits costs between chemical and \napplication, and on average growers are spending 62 per cent on \nchemical costs and 38 per cent on application. \n5.4  Comparison with other \navailable data\nOur results indicate that herbicide chemical costs to Australian \nbroadacre crop growers alone are $1888 million. This amount \nincludes $1333 million in-season, $370 million in fallow and $185 \nmillion from herbicides used in conjunction with IWM practices (such \nas delayed seeding with knockdown, double knockdown for weed \ncontrol and crop topping). The average of all Australian herbicide \nsales across multiple industries collated by the Australian Pesticides \nand Veterinary Medicines Authority over the study period (2018-19 \nto 2020-21) was $1912 million annually, while combined herbicide \nand adjuvant sales for the same period was $2029 million. \nThe APVMA herbicide and adjuvant sales data are plotted over \ntime in Figure 9, which highlights the volatility over recent years. \nThe long-term average (2011 to 2021), excluding the COVID-related \n2022 spike as a result of supply-chain constraints, is $1705 million. \nThe average APVMA herbicide and adjuvant sales over the \nstudy period is higher, indicating the study period is a deviation \nof the long-term average. Focusing on the APVMA herbicide \nand adjuvant sales data for the three-year study period, the data \nshow a rapid increase in costs: a 49 per cent increase over the \nstudy period. The estimate of $1888 million for herbicide chemical \ncosts in the national weed impact model is close to the APVMA \naverage for the study period of $2029 million. This means that the \nherbicide value totals found in this study represent approximately \n93 per cent of all APVMA declared herbicide and adjuvant sales. \nNote that herbicide prices in 2023-24 are returning to near 2020-21 \nlevels. The pre-COVID Glyphosate 450 price was $3.60 per litre, \nand it reached more than $12.00/L during COVID. In 2023, it was \nclose to $4.00/L (Crop Smart, 2023). The price of Paraquat 250 \nhas been slower to return to the pre-COVID level of $3.50/L, and  \nit was at $5.00/L in May 2023.\nIn 2023, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource \nEconomics and Sciences commissioned a report on the cost of \nestablished pest animals and weeds to Australian agricultural \ngrowers. The report found a total cost of at least $5.3 billion, with \nweeds contributing to 82 per cent of the total costs  \n3500\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\nSales (million A$)\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 20222011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2024\nSource: adapted from APVMA data\nFigure 9: APVMA herbicide and adjuvant annual sales figures from 2011 to 2023* . \n*The national herbicide chemical cost model value of $1,888 million (chemical cost of herbicide in-season, fallow and integrated weed management)  \nis displayed as a red diamond. \nSource: adapted from APVMA data\nIMPACT OF WEEDS ON AUSTRALIAN GRAIN AND COTTON PRODUCTION \n33\n(Hafi et al., 2023). The study compared animal pests and weeds \nin multiple industries and based their cropping analysis on the \nLlewellyn et al. (2016) study. The study provided a comparison with \nother sectors. Costs in grain and cotton represented 88 per cent \nof all farming industries considered, including livestock and grazing \nindustries. The study confirmed that cropping systems have high \nexpenditure costs relative to residual losses, while expenditure and \nresidual losses are similar in livestock systems. \nPlanfarm is another source of herbicide use data that can be used \nto validate and compare the cost of weed herbicide chemical \ncosts, mainly in the Western Australian (WA) grains (and mixed \nfarming) sector (Planfarm Bankwest, 2014 to 2023). Planfarm is a \nWestern Australian-based agricultural consultancy that collates \nfinancial and production data on broadacre farm businesses from \nPlanfarm, BJW, Agribusiness and BusinessAg clients throughout \nWA. They have created a series of state industry benchmark \nreports spanning 10 years. Herbicide costs are reported on a per \nhectare basis for different regions in WA and the whole western \nregion. Nominal herbicide costs for the whole western region are \nplotted over time in Figure 10. Similarities can be drawn between \nthe APVMA and the Planfarm data, including the large COVID-\nrelated spike in 2022 and the steady rise in herbicide costs from \nthe start of the study period to the end (2019 to 2021). The national \nweed impact model estimates herbicide costs in the western \nregion at $697 million or $86/ha (herbicide in-season, fallow \nand from a range of IWM practices), while the average Planfarm \nherbicide costs derived from their client database for the study \nperiod is $92/ha. \n5.5  Comparison with previous \nstudies\nAlthough the opportunity for direct comparison with earlier \nstudies of weed cost is limited, there are some notable trends and \nsimilarities. Jones et al. (2005) evaluated yield losses and weed \ncontrol expenditure costs in wheat, oats, barley, canola, pulses \nand lupins over one growing season in 1998-99. That study only \nconsidered two expenditure costs (herbicide and tillage practices) \nand only two forms of revenue loss (yield losses from in-crop \nweeds and grain contamination/cleaning). It did not consider \nfallow weeds. The study found that in 1998-99 the financial cost \nof weeds in the seven major winter grain crops was $1182 million \n(or $2616 million in 2020-21 dollar terms). Llewellyn et al. (2016) \nevaluated yield losses and expenditure costs in grain crops \nover three growing seasons from 2010-2011 to 2012-2013 and \nestimated that weeds cost $3300 million, which equates to $3997 \nmillion in 2020-21 dollar terms. \nCombellack (1987) estimated that weed control costs (for example, \ncultivation, herbicide treatments) were 60 per cent of total weed \ncosts. In the Jones et al. (2005) study, expenditure costs made up \n66 per cent of the total costs of weeds. Of the two expenditure \ncosts considered in that study, herbicides contributed 73 per cent \nof all expenditure. In the Llewellyn et al. (2016) study, expenditure \ncosts made up most of the total costs of weeds (78 per cent). \nThe increases in expenditure on weed control relative to yield \nlosses over time may be partly due to more expenditure costs \nbeing considered in the studies, but it is also likely to reflect more \ncost-effective weed control options contributing to lower weed \ndensities and less yield damage. Although this study considers \nmore weed control practices, herbicide use still contributed 74 per \ncent of all expenditure costs. In this study, 71 per cent of costs were \nattributable to herbicide use (in-crop and fallow). In Combellack \n(1987) only 22 per cent of expenditure on weed control was \nattributable to herbicides, as cultivation was still a primary weed \ncontrol method.\nThe Jones et al. (2005) study found that the costliest weeds \nnationally were annual ryegrass, wild oats and wild radish. \nSimilarly, Llewellyn et al. (2016) determined residual weeds \npopulations by a survey of growers found that the costliest weeds \nnationally were annual ryegrass, wild radish, wild oats and brome \ngrass. In this study, the top-ranking weeds based on revenue \nlosses in all grain crops were ryegrass, brome grass, sow thistle, \nwild radish and wild oats. A recent report by Bajwa et al. (2025) on \nthe changing ecology and biology of key weed species affecting \nAustralian grains due to climate and soil factors identified the top \nfive priority weed species nationally as annual ryegrass, fleabane, \nbrome grass, sow thistle and wild radish. In terms of winter weeds, \nthere is a high degree of consistency over decades, with annual \nryegrass continuing to be the dominant weed-based on costs \nincurred nationally, with a possible rise in the relative impact of \nbrome grass. Wild radish continues to be a major winter broadleaf \nweed. Generally, the sequence of studies demonstrates that the \nmajor weeds represent an ongoing and consistent target for \nimproved management options through R&D.\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nCost (million A$)\n2013 2014 2016 2018 2020 20222015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2024\nFigure 10: Planfarm herbicide cost per hectare for the whole of the western region from 2014 to 2023* . \n*The national herbicide chemical cost model value of $697 million or $86/ha (chemical cost of herbicide in-season, fallow and integrated weed management)  \nis displayed as a red diamond.\nSource: Planfarm Bankwest, (2014–24).

Growers’ investment in weed control is reflected \nin low weed densities in-season and during the fallow period, \nresulting in relatively low revenue losses associated with \nweeds. This investment means that growers are taking a long-\nterm economic optimal approach in managing their weeds and \nseedbanks, allowing more flexibility and choice within their \nfarming enterprise. How growers choose to manage their weeds \nhas evolved over time. As Australian cropping systems have \ngradually intensified, with a shift away from mixed farming, growers \nhave become more reliant on herbicides for weed control. The \navailability of cost-effective weed control has allowed many \naspects of Australian farming systems to be successful and \nprofitable. This heavy reliance on herbicides is evident in multiple \nstudies, including this one, with the cost of herbicides contributing \nmore than 70 per cent of expenditure costs. Despite this, growers \nincreasingly invest in a range of integrated weed management \npractices, chemical and non-chemical, many of which offer multiple \nbenefits to the farming systems. Weed management is likely to \ncontinue to change in the future due to changes in temperature \nand rainfall, public health concerns over some herbicides, and \nchanges in herbicide-resistant weeds. Investment to support \ngrowers to adapt their weed management strategies will ensure \nAustralian farms remain profitable and relatively weed free.  ☐\nCotton growing in New South Wales.

Weed-free yields are used in the model to estimate \nyield losses due to weeds; it is also used to discount yields when \ncertain management practices are used. In the model, the weed-\nfree yield is estimated by using a combination of National Variety \nTrial (NVT) results and Australian Bureau of Statistics production \ndata. The weed-free yields are calculated by taking the average of \nthe upper and lower bounds for crop yield. The model uses ABS \ncrop yield to determine the lower bound of crop yield estimate \nand uses NVT data to estimate the upper bound of crop yield. Not \nall crops, years and AEZ have NVT trial results, in these cases we \nhave used the production data only to estimate the weed-free \nyields. (Sorghum, cotton and in some AEZ oats, have no NVT  \nyield results).\n6 Appendix\nTable 25: Wheat model input data: area, yield, production and weed-free yields .\nCrop area (ha) Production (t)

However, on 1 January 2025, the Australian Gov ernment introduced mandatory climate-related financ ial \ndisclosure reporting, called the Australian Sustain ability Reporting Standards (ASRS) AASB 2 (referred t o as ASRS \nin this report for brevity). The ASRS are standards for assessing and disclosing information about an entity’s climate \nand sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Only one of the ASRS standards is mandatory at this stage, ASRS \nAASB 2, and is the focus of this report.  \nThe introduction of the ASRS means that many large companies and institutions, including farms, which meet certain \ncriteria around revenue, gross assets, or number of  employees are, or will be, required to report their  greenhouse \n(GHG) emissions data under a new framework. This incl udes scope 1 and 2 emissions initially, followed by scope 3 \nemissions. Smaller entities that are not required t o report directly may need to supply their GHG emiss ions data to \nthird parties within their supply chain, so that the ir supply chain can meet their scope 3 emissions re quirements. \nSupplying scope 3 emissions data to reporting entities is likely to have the largest effect on cotton farming businesses \nin the immediate future, especially in relation to banks (and potentially insurers), who have a direct line of sight to \ntheir clients. Limited and complex cotton supply chain traceability will likely result in, for example, brands and retailers \nrelying on secondary data, such as industry average s, in the first instance rather than farm-specific primary data for \ntheir scope 3 emissions reporting. The development of a robust, Australian-specific cotton emissions i ntensity \ndatabase in line with emerging guidance is needed to keep Australian cotton competitive in world markets. \nA survey of the rural lenders and farm insurers rev ealed strong activity from the banking sector on en gaging their \nfarming clients in collecting farm-specific GHG emissions data. All the bankers and finance brokers surveyed reported \ndiscussions with farmers linked to ASRS compliance. I n contrast, the insurance industry brokers, and far m \nunderwriting representatives, had no awareness and we re not conversant in understanding the ASRS reportin g \nrequirements. The bankers surveyed were also aware of voluntary Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures \n(TNFD) reporting and obligations, however respondents  alluded to the recent “Trump effect” of railing ag ainst \nenvironmental regulation which inferred TNFD as regula tory overreach. Banks, when asked if ASRS reporting \nrequirements were likely to create a “price on susta inability” in the future, a mixed response ensued wi th almost half \nof responses claiming, “it’s already happening” to “the credit market is already too competitive to draft discounts and \npremiums among clients”. A small survey sample of c otton brands and retailers suggested that scope 3 r eporting in \nthe cotton supply chain remains likely, although li mitation and usefulness of industry data exists unt il a trusted \ntraceability scheme can be implemented to track the  source of fibre to farm. Large companies in this s ector affected \nby ASRS were content to use secondary data to fulfil ASRS requirements. Demonstrating biodiversity stewards hip \nwas also mentioned as a key sustainability metric for brands and retailers. Supply chain requirements remain an area \nof more detailed future research. \nAs the irrigated cotton industry experiences a shif t to more resilient systems, introducing bankless i rrigation that can \nadapt to extreme weather conditions, reduce inputs without compromising yield, and produce higher output per labour \nunit there may result in small benefits for agriculture finance and ASRS strategy reporting. A minority group of banks \nhad plans or finance products in place to offer mor e competitive credit for investing in more efficien t irrigation \ninfrastructure if environmental gains could be proven. Separately, bankless irrigation does satisfy the main criteria as \na strategy for specifically dealing with several risks under the AASB S2 core topics . \nA survey of specialist property valuers and irrigators found the flow on monetary gains to asset valuation following the \ninstallation of bankless systems can be in the rang e of $500 to $2,000 per hectare, with access to labo ur as the \nprimary driver. An economic analysis using a Whole Farm Modelling (WFM) approach sensitivity tested th ese \nvaluation uplift scenarios with two installation cost outcomes ($600/Ha and $4,200/Ha) each investigating 400 Ha and \n782 Ha of development respectively. The overall equi ty position of the farm, considering a 20% water sav ing and \n$230/Ha labour saving under the new operating scenari o, the WFM was a very resilient system with a strong asset \nand earning base. Only in the high cost ($4,200), low valuation (+$500/Ha uplift) and the whole-of-farm development \ndid return on assets and return on equity erode considerably, owing in-part to the relatively conservative Debt/Equity \nratio of 82%. Current day assets and earnings were a pplied to the WFM. These results are exploratory on ly and \nshould be viewed as a snapshot at a particular locat ion at a particular point in time. It may be inaccu rate for farms \nwith markedly different soil type, climate, and resources to those of the Lower Namoi Valley representative farm. \n \n \nIntroduction \nBusinesses are embedded within the natural environment and natural systems. Their supply chains, operations, and \nproducts fundamentally depend on and impact nature. They are therefore increasingly affected by the consequences \nof depletion and degradation of nature, for example , through reduced availability of natural resources , such as \nirrigation water, and essential ecosystem services, or via increased regulation and social concern abou t business \nimpacts on the environment.  \nThese potential effects on businesses are now starti ng to be described as nature-related risks, for exa mple, by the \nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNF D). The TNFD defines nature as the interaction between \nEnvironmental assets and society, as shown in Figure 1. In addition, newly legislated mandatory climate reporting in \nAustralia requires businesses to disclose against t he Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (AS RS) Climate \nStandard, AASB S2. Further, the top four global ris ks over the next 10 years, as identified by the Wor ld Economic \nForum, are all nature-related: Climate action failu re, failure of climate change adaption, extreme weat her, and \nbiodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse (with human environmental damage and natural resource crises also in the \ntop 10).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: The interaction between nature and society, as defined by the TNFD \nAt the same time, risks can also create opportunities. For example, opportunities related to the improved management \nof climate and nature-related risks. This highlight s the imperative for businesses to understand how cl imate and \nnature-related risks (and opportunities) translate into business risks (and opportunities), and for lenders and investors \nto understand the implications across their loan books and investment portfolios.  \nThere are growing expectations of businesses to meas ure and report on nature-related risks to provide a ssurances \nto their key stakeholders that they are operating sustainably due to the impact of these risks on corporate strategy and \nsocial licence. A recent legal opinion has found th at these risks are reasonably foreseeable and that directors of \ncompanies may be legally liable for failing to cons ider these risks in the discharge of their fiduciar y duties (Smith et \nal., 2024). Despite this, the TNFD states that most bu sinesses are currently not adequately assessing or disclosing \ntheir nature-related risks. \nOne consideration overlooked in the transition to r eporting nature-related risks is the impact on land  values and the \nfinancier’s view of sustainable practice change, whic h is yet to be explored. With strong annual appreci ation in land \n\n \n \nvalues through the last two decades (Rural Bank, 2024), irrigators relationship with debt service providers is becoming \nincreasingly important. Those wishing to expand oper ations or deal with family succession require suppor t and \nendorsement of their banks to access debt capital t o fund productivity. Equally, lenders have their own  ASRS and \nTNFD disclosure requirements that their customers must adhere to. The intersection of both the finance industry and \nirrigators preparation for mandatory climate-related reporting and potentially TNFD reporting of adaptation measures, \nsuch as irrigation efficiencies, is therefore highly relevant.  \nBankless Irrigation \nBankless irrigation systems remove the need for portable siphons, significantly reducing labour requirements. These \nsystems can also result in machine efficiency in turning, converting to energy and higher machine hectares per hour. \nOther input efficiencies such as improved water and nitrogen use efficiency have been identified in sug ar, cotton, \ncereals and rice studies; however, the quantum of improvement is highly dependent on the baseline efficiency of the \nexisting system. Structural designs vary but genera lly involve high flow rates with all furrows in each bay irrigated at \nonce (Figure 2). Bankless systems can remove storm water more quickly and efficiently during intense rainfall events, \nreducing denitrification events and production of n itrous oxide emissions. The business case for bankl ess has been \nthe focus of irrigated industries over the last dec ade, with studies finding a trifecta of benefits in most cases: water, \nlabour and improved nitrogen use efficiency (Welsh, 2024a, Welsh, 2024b). There is little doubt that farms with these \nsystems are more resilient, often operating with lowe r inputs and manage their crops with greater precisi on through \nmore nimble water management. For these reasons, the links between preparedness for a warming climate including \nmore extreme events and best practice management in  irrigation may have dual benefits as mandatory rep orting \nrequirements filter through various agricultural supply chains.  \nFigure 2: A small pipe through the bank, or bankless system used to irrigate cotton at “Waverley” Wee Waa  \n  \n\n \n \nResearch Questions \n \nThis study has two interlinked but separate topics of investigation. \n \n1. What are the economic and financial implications  of improving farm productivity in ways that enhanc e \nsystem and climate resilience? \n2.

This means that many large companies and institutions, including farms, which meet certain criteria around \nrevenue, gross assets, or number of employees are, or will be, required to report their GHG emissions un der a new \nframework. This includes scope 1 and 2 emissions initially, followed by scope 3 emissions. \nBeyond the newly introduced mandatory climate-relate d financial disclosure reporting, organisations can  engage in \nvoluntary sustainability frameworks such as for exam ple the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), CDP (former ly carbon \ndisclosure project), the Taskforce on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures (TNFD), Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs), Climate Active, B Corp Certification. The requirements relating to the TNFD are also examined as part of this \nstudy. \nOverview of the ASRS \nA new mandatory sustainability reporting regime star ted in Australia on 1 January 2025, called the Aust ralian \nSustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS). The ASRS are standards for assessing and disclosing information about \nan entity’s climate and sustainability-related risk s and opportunities (Lederman, 2024). Two standards have been \nissued by the AASB so far, AASB S1 and AASB S2. The  AASB S1 General requirements for Disclosure of \nSustainability-related Financial Information are a voluntary standard. The AASB S2 Climate Related Disclosures is a \nmandatory standard, and entities need to comply with this standard when preparing their sustainability reports under \nthe Corporations Act 2001. AASB S2 requires entities to disclosure information about risks and opportunities related \nto climate which could reasonably be expected to aff ect cash flows, access to finance, or cost of capita l over time. \nThe ASRS was developed based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2, issued by the \nInternational Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) . The IFRS sustainability standards are being implem ented in \nmany countries globally and build on the work of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). \nReporting under AASB S2 will be phased in over severa l years based on the size and emissions of an entit y. \nOrganisations may be captured if they are required to publish financial statements under the Corporatio ns Act, \nincluding if they are a large proprietary company, a listed company that triggers size thresholds, an NGER reported, \nor a responsible Superannuation Entity or Managed I nvestment Scheme with 5 billion or more in assets un der \nmanagement. The relevant reporting groups are summarised in Table 1 below.  \nTable 1: Relevant reporting groups \nWho and when Entities captured by Corps Act Ch 2M fi nancial reporting \nobligations, and who are either: \n \nReporting \nperiod on \nor after: \nFirst report \ndue (FY \nreporting) \na) Large listed and unlisted entities \nand their controlled entities \nmeeting 2 of 3 criteria \nb) NGER \nreporter \nc) Super \nfinds & \nInvestment \nSchemes \nCons. \nrevenue \nGross \nassets \nFTE \nEmployees \nGroup 1 \n1 Jan 2025 \nAfter 30 June \n2026 \n$500m $1b 500 NGER publication \nthreshold \n \nGroup 2 \n1 Jul 2026 \nAfter 30 June \n2027 \n$200m $500m 250 All NGER \nreporters \n$5b assets under \nmanagement \nGroup 3 \n1 Jul 2027 \nAfter 30 June \n2028 \n$50m $25m 100 N/A  \nThe AASB S2 sets out the following main requirements (Australian Government, 2025):  \n \n \nASSB S2 Climate-related Disclosures set out disclosure requirements for \nan entity to provide useful information to primary users of its general \npurpose financial report about climate-related risks and opportunities that \ncould reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s cash flows, access to \nfinance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. \nThe main climate-related financial disclosure requirements relate to \ngovernance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, including \ninformation about scenario analysis and Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \nThe risks and opportunities are collectively referr ed to as ‘climate-related risks and opportunities t hat could be \nexpected to affect the entity’s prospects. The AASB  S2 applies to both climate-related physical risks and to climate-\nrelated physical risks, as well as climate-related opportunities. Climate risks which could not reasonably be expected \nto affect an entity’s prospects are outside scope. There is a one-year relief period for reporting sco pe 3 emissions, \nmeaning Scope 3 emissions will need to be reported i n the second reporting period. Scope 3 emissions ar e the \nindirect emissions that relate to the upstream and downstream value chain, as well as financing and inv estment \nactivities. Therefore, even smaller entities that a re not required to report under the ASRS, may need t o supply their \nemissions data to third parties within their supply chain.  \nMost small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are exclud ed from complying with the ASRS based on their size ( see \nTable 1). However, the legislation accommodates the l owering of these thresholds in the future, so SMEs m ay be \nrequired to comply in the future. The assurance requirements relating to the ASRS will be phased in for sustainability \nreporting, starting with limited assurance reporting and increasing to full assurance of climate disclosures from 1 July \n2030. \nCompanies captured by AASB S2 need to prepare an annual sustainability report along with its financial statements. \nThe sustainability report consists of the climate s tatements for the year, any accompanying notes to t he climate \nstatements, and a directors’ declaration about the statements and notes. The climate statements will in clude \ninformation on governance and risk management, clim ate resilience assessments and scenario analysis, c limate \ntransition plans (CTP), climate-related targets, mat erial climate-related risks and opportunities, and specific metrics \nand targets including scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions (Lederman, 2024).\n  \nIn the first instance, the AASB S2 will impact compa nies that meet Group 1, 2, or 3 thresholds that are  required to \ncomply with the standards directly (see Table 1 abov e). The specific, real-world implications for small or medium \nentities that are not required to comply with the AS RS in the near term are not yet fully known. However, b anks, \ninsurers, suppliers and customers may need data fro m small and medium sized entities to meet their obl igations \nunder the standards, especially with regards to scope 3 emissions. \nAASB S2 core topics and associated disclosures \nFour core topics are established in AASB S2, which have the following climate-related financial disclosure objectives. \n Governance: To enable users to understand the gove rnance processes, controls and procedures used to \nmonitor, manage, and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities. \n Strategy: To enable users to understand an entity’ s strategy for managing climate-related risks and \nopportunities. \n Risk management: To enable users to understand an e ntity’s processes to identify, assess, prioritise, and \nmonitor climate-related risks and opportunities, including whether and how they are integrated into and inform \nan entity’s overall risk management. \n \n \n Metrics and targets: To enable users to understand  an entity’s performance in relation to its climate -related \nrisks and opportunities, including progress towards any climate-related targets set or required to be m et by \nlaw or regulation. This includes scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. \nDisclosure of specific information is required under  the topic to reach the topic objective. Of relevan ce in the context \nof this report is an entity’s strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Specifically, an entity needs \nto disclose information related to: \n Climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect its prospects \n Current and anticipated effects of those risks on t he entity’s business model  and value chain  \n Effects on the entity’s strategy and decision maki ng, including its climate-related transition plan (Schoff and \nSegorbe, 2024)  \n Effects on the entity’s financial position, perfor mance and cash-flows in the current reporting period  and in \nthe short, medium, and long term \n The climate resilience  of the entity’s strategy and its business model to  climate-related changes, \ndevelopments and uncertainties considering the iden tified climate-related risks and opportunities. Thi s \nincludes the use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess its climate resilience. \nReporting on climate resilience using climate scenario analysis includes at least two scenarios, including one low and \none high warming scenario. The short, medium, and long term need to be considered, as well as the entire operations, \nassets, investments and value chain. The impacts of each scenario on strategy, business model, and ability to respond \nneed to be assessed (Turner, 2025). \nScope 3 measurement framework \nThe AASB S2 requires an entity to disclose informat ion about its scope 3 emissions (Australian Governm ent, 2025). \nThe entity needs to consider its entire value chain  (upstream and downstream) and all 15 categories of scope 3 \nemissions (Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 2024). Small an d medium sized entities that do not meet the requir ements to \ndisclosure their climate-related risks and opportun ities for their own entity under AASB S2, may still need to report \ndata about their emissions into their agricultural supply.  \nAASB S2 notes that the measurement of scope 3 emiss ions is likely to include estimation as well as dire ct \nmeasurement, and that a measurement approach, input s, and assumptions should be used that result in a faithful \nrepresentation of this measurement. The standard does not specify the inputs the entity is required to use to measure \nscope 3 emissions, but an entity does need to prior itise inputs and assumptions that use data based on  direct \nmeasurement, data from specific activities within the value chain, time data that represents jurisdiction and technology \nuse, and data that has been verified. Managerial judgement may be required in terms of trade-offs between different \naspects of the measurement approach (e.g. newer data may have less detail).  \nRegarding data from specific activities within the entity’s value chain, the AASB S2 notes that primary data (obtained \ndirectly from specific activities within the entity's value chain) is more likely to be representative of the emissions than \nsecondary data, and that the use of primary data sh ould be prioritised all else being equal. Secondary  data may be \nsupplied by third-party data providers and include industry-average data, and an entity using secondar y data needs \nto consider if such data faithfully represents the entity’s activities. \nImpact on agriculture and cotton \nThe Bendigo Bank (2024) Australian Agricultural Out look for 2025 elucidates the flow on effects from ma ndatory \nclimate-related reporting of emissions data on smaller and medium agriculture entities as follows: \n \n \nBy the end of 2027 nearly all businesses will be annually reporting at least \nthe emissions intensity of their products and their plan to reduce emissions. \nFinancial institutions are clearly among those required to report directly to \nASIC in a comprehensive sustainability document. They will be assessing \ntheir scope 3 emissions and reporting on them. \nNot long after the emissions reporting starts, there will be decisions made \nabout the emissions profile and emissions reduction plans of individual \nsuppliers. The intent of this initiative is to reward those who reduce \nemissions, and disadvantage those who do not. \nDisadvantages could include loss of market opportunity as preferred \nsuppliers. Lower prices for products, and higher interest rates for producers \nwhose emissions intensity is too high, are among some of the options on \nthe table for discussion. \nThe Rabobank (2025) Agribusiness Outlook also notes that the mandatory climate-related financial disclo sure \nrequirements, and the current requirement to measur e and report on scope 3 emissions from the second y ear of \nreporting, are expected to drive growing demand for emissions-related data at the farm level. The impac t on small-\nscale farmers of Australia’s mandatory climate-related financial disclosures was also discussed by Professor Richard \nEckard in a recent presentation to the grains industry, where he noted that (Bidstrup, 2024): \n“Farms, even those that are relatively small-scale, are part of this larger \nequation. When major agricultural supply chain companies like Unilever, \nNestle and Mars are setting ambitious GHG reduction targets of up to 50% \nby 2030, that ambition filters down through their supply chains. It will be \nimportant for farmers to have a clear understanding of their GHG ‘number’ \nand how they can reduce it.” Professor Rich Eckard. \nThe Australian Farm Institute, in a recent Occasion al Paper on Agriculture and the Reach of Mandatory G HG \nReporting, noted that the largest effect on the agriculture sector is the need to supply information for scope 3 reporting \ndown the supply chain (Sevenster and Cowie, 2024). The  development of a robust, Australian-specific cotto n \nemissions intensity database in line with emerging guidance is needed to keep Australian cotton competitive in world \nmarkets. Specifically, it notes that: \nThe sector will need to navigate complexities, with emissions sources that \nare challenging to quantify and guidance yet to emerge, adding to the \nreporting burden. It will be important that locally relevant methods and \nemissions factors are applied to Australian produce, as use of international \ndefaults can lead to overestimates of the carbon footprint of at least some \nAustralian products. \nThe Australian government will develop voluntary standards for emissions reporting in agriculture (DCCEEW, 2024), \nhowever, this will not be available when the AASB S2 c omes into force. This can help provide guidance, re duce the \nreporting burden and support the use of locally rel evant methods and data. To date, a Voluntary Greenh ouse Gas \n \n \nEstimation and Reporting Standards Reference Group ha s been established. In the Australian grains sector , \nSevenster (2024) found Australian grains is a low em itter of GHGs compared with other global producers, resulting \nin improved market access for Australian canola which is valued at A$1B per annum. \nFor Australian cotton, there is full traceability f rom the farm to the spinning mill. Australian cotto n bales come with a \nunique barcode identifier, which means that the bale can be traced back to where it was ginned and the area in which \nit was grown. However, beyond the spinning mill the tra ceability is more complex as cotton fibres are ofte n blended \nwith cotton from other countries. Whilst new commerci al, technology-based solutions for traceability of cotton are in \ndevelopment or already in the market(Australian Cotton, 2024): \n[…] the reality is that for most brands, cotton traceability remains a largely \nmanual process that relies on the provision of evidence by people in \nbusinesses at various stages of production. \nThe limited transparency in cotton supply chains presents an immediate challenge for emissions and climate-related \nrisk and opportunity reporting. However, new mandatory  climate-related disclosure reporting will likely be  a catalyst \nto create greater transparency and traceability in cotton supply chains going forward. One such supply chain strategy \nis carbon “insetting”. While offsetting refers to c ompensation for greenhouse gas reductions outside a  company’s \nvalue chain, insetting in the agri-food value chain  is a method of generating shared value across the value chain by \nincentivising climate action and adaptation on farm , while supporting farmer incomes. Insetting also di ffers from \noffsetting by internalising negative environmental externalities of a firm within its own value chain, r ather than \npurchasing offsetting credits from outside its value chain (Banerjee et al., 2013). \nRequirements on banks servicing the agricultural sector under the ASRS \nEntities that finance activities face both risks an d opportunities related to those activities. Borrowe rs, investees and \nother counterparties with high levels of emissions m ight be associated with risks due to technological c hanges, \ndemand and supply shifts, and policy changes. Such risks are increasingly monitored and managed by mea suring \nfinanced emissions, as an indicator to climate-related risk and opportunity exposure. \nUnder the ASRS, entities that engage in asset managem ent, commercial banking, and insurance must disclos e \nadditional information associated with their investments (Australian Government, 2025). For commercial banking, this \nincludes: \n Absolute gross financed emissions (disaggregated b y scope 1, 2, 3 emissions) for each industry (using GICS \nindustry level code) by asset class. \n Gross exposure to each industry by asset class. \n Percentages of the entity’s gross exposure include d in the financed emissions calculation.  \n The methodology the entity used to calculate its f inanced emissions. \nSome commercial banks, such as NAB, set sector specific decarbonisation targets for their financed emissions. NAB \nlending to the sector was $40 billion as of 30 June 2022. However, a sector-specific target has not yet b een set for \nthe agriculture sector, due to imminent material improvements to data and methodologies. NAB is expecting to update \non its approach to decarbonising its agriculture po rtfolio in 2025. For example, the Australian Govern ment on the \nAgriculture and Land sectoral plan is expected to outline how to transition the agriculture sector to a net zero economy. \nNational Australia Bank (2023) notes that accuracy and reliability of data is a challenge in this sector. \nAgriculture’s responsibilities under the TNFD \nThe Taskforce for Nature-Related Disclosures (TNFD) is a market-driven global initiative to create a frame work for \nreporting on and addressing risks and opportunities that relate to nature. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, \n \n \nthe Environment and Water (DCCEEW, 2023) summarised the TNFD as follows: \n TNFD is a risk management and disclosure framework on nature-related \nrisks to support the shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative \noutcomes and toward nature-positive outcomes. \nThe DCCEEW also notes that the TNFD is voluntary (and no t a standard), is closely aligned to the Taskforce for \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), allows for  increasing levels of disclosure over time and is b eing \ndeveloped to align with ISSB and other market tools and standards. \nThe final TNFD recommendations were launched in Septem ber 2023. They are technically voluntary for Austra lian \nbusinesses; however, a recent legal opinion suggests  that there is potential for directors to be under legal duty to \ndisclose material nature-related risks. Further, Au stralian business may be subject to EU-based nature -related \nreporting obligations (Miller et al., 2023). \nImpact on agriculture and cotton \nAgriculture, including cotton cultivation, can impa ct nature negatively if not managed well. It is depe ndent on \necosystem services such as healthy soil, water, and biodiversity. Intensive farming can reduce pollinat ors and the \nquality of soil and water. However, sustainable practices can positively impact nature and the environment as well.  \nDCCEEW (2023) undertook a pilot study in 2023 on tackl ing TNFD in domestic cotton cultivation for export, wh ere \npilot participants practically assessed the TNFD’s nature-related risk and opportunity assessment approach, which is \ncalled the LEAP. The approach is voluntary guidance  to support the assessment of nature-related risks and \nopportunities and involves five phases: Scoping, Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare.  \nThe study gave several nature-related risks and opportunities (assessment) as examples for organisations operating \nin the domestic cotton cultivation for export value  chain, specifically in cotton growing, ginning, and  pressing. The \nstudy noted that the physical risks are chronic, and that changes to regulation and maintenance of ecosystem services \nsuch as soil health and timing of water may increase costs of natural inputs and/or to increase the cost for adaptation \n(e.g. more labour to suppress disease or reduced productivity). On the other hand, nature-related opportunities were \nalso available, including increased brand value for nature-positive products and business models that benefit nature, \nespecially biodiversity in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.  \nThe study noted businesses that understand both the  impacts and dependencies they have on and with natu re will \nbe better able to manage risk and implement mitigation measures for the benefit of their operations and supply chains, \nas well as take advantage of current and future opportunities.  \n \nRequirements on banks servicing the agricultural sector under the TNFD \nFor financial institutions, the above-mentioned DCCEEW study noted that financial incentives could be used to drive \nsustainability performance improvements and reduce nature impacts from clients, customers, and investe es. \nHowever, the reduction in financial asset values, tri ggering write-offs or early exits may occur due to d egraded \necosystem services such as soil fertility, water availability, and pollination. \nAs of October 2024, there was 23 Australian companie s and financial institutions that have committed to  getting \nstarted with voluntary reporting in line with the TNFD recommendations. Globally, there are over 440 companies and \nfinancial institutions which have made the same comm itment (TNFD, 2024). Financial institutions are incre asingly \nmentioning the TNFD in their reporting. For example, the ANZ (2024) Climate-related Financial Disclosures n oted \nthat they continue to draw on the TNFD framework to hel p inform their disclosures, but that the disclosure s do not \npurport to be comprehensive or to satisfy all aspec ts of the TNFD’s recommended disclosures. Similarly, NAB are a \nmember of the TNFD Forum and has undertaken a range of activities to further their understanding of TNF D and its \n \n \nimplications on their business (National Australia Bank, 2024).  \nLinks between farm productivity, sustainable practices and ASRS and TNFD \nrequirements \nASRS reporting entities will be required to assess and report on climate-related risks and opportunities that could be \nexpected to affect its prospects. They, therefore, will be asking smaller and medium entities in their value chain about \ntheir current and future emissions, and how climate-related risks and opportunities are being addressed.  \nIt may be the case that, in the short term, ASRS rep orting entities in the cotton supply chain use seco ndary data to \nestimate their emissions from the cotton farm, such  as an average tonne/CO2-e per bale of cotton purcha sed. \nPreferably, the average emissions per cotton bale wi ll be Australia specific for cotton that has origin ated in Australia \n(as opposed to an international benchmark). However, some reporting entities may request specific emissions at the \nfarm level in the near term. As the mandatory repor ting on climate-related risks matures and the futur e issuance of \nvoluntary standards for emissions reporting in agriculture by the government is introduced, transparency in the cotton \nsupply chain from its current situation is likely t o improve. This, in turn, will increase requests for  more granular and \nfarm-specific information on emissions and sustainability initiatives going forward. \nThis is consistent with recent commentary from RaboResearch sustainability analyst Anna Drake (2025): \n“If direct farm-specific primary data cannot be obtained without undue cost \nor effort, reporting entities are permitted to use indirect, secondary data, \nsuch as industry average, in order to fulfill their GHG measurement \nrequirements,” she said. “This will likely limit near-term the widespread \nimpact on farmers.” […] “Reporting companies are expected to increasingly \nlook to source relevant activity data from their supply chains to improve the \naccuracy of their scope 3 measurement over time,” Ms Drake said. \nOn-farm productivity and sustainability initiatives , such as bankless irrigation, that address key cli mate-related risks \nsuch as drought, changing rainfall patterns, and/or  increased pressure to reduce the use of nitrogen ( either through \nregulation or market demand) are likely to become m ore important for ASRS reporting entities, and in tu rn their \nsuppliers. Reporting entities or suppliers that do not address climate-related risks adequately may lose their place as \npreferred suppliers or face higher interest rates. On the flip side, suppliers that do report on and a ddress such risks \nmay be rewarded as preferred suppliers and/or lower interest rates. \nFurther, suppliers, lenders, and others in the cotton value chain that report to the TNFD framework may increasingly \nneed to understand impacts and dependencies that in dividual farms have on nature. However, even for very  large \nbanks such as ANZ and NAB, TNFD-related disclosures are an evolving area . \nImpact on agricultural financing \nIt is possible that the introduction of the ASRS (and voluntary reporting to the TNFD) will drive the offerings and uptake \nof sustainable finance, with banks required to cons ider both their own climate-related risks and opport unities and \nthose of borrowers (through their financed emissions ). Generally, financial activities that integrate e nvironmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) considerations are con sidered “sustainable finance”. There are several ex amples of \nsustainable finance in agriculture, including susta inability-linked loans from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia \n(CBA) and Agri Green Loans from the National Australi a Bank (NAB). These types of loan products provide finance \nfor activities on the farm that result in environmental benefits.  \nImproved farm sustainability may be rewarded with access to finance on better terms as initiatives such as the ASRS \nshine a light on the emissions and nature-related risks and opportunities of small and large farms. Financial institutions \nmay consider, for example, higher interest rates fo r higher emitters to meet their own ambitious emissi ons targets. \nSimilarly, they may consider better terms for lower emitters, or for loans which bring their organisatio n closer to \n \n \nmeeting their own climate-related targets. \nIn January 2025, the Clean Energy Finance Corporatio n (2025) announced its backing for a $300 million c o-finance \nprogram with NAB to cut the borrowing costs for farme rs (and others). The commitment included $100 milli on to \nsupport a 1.15 per cent interest rate discount for backing financing solutions for farmers to reduce t he emissions of \ntheir operations, including enhanced fertilisers and changed land-use methodologies. \nGoing forward, it may be the case that financial ins titutions embed environmental, social, and governan ce data into \nthe usual practices of commercial banks. The 2023 AgriFutures Banking on Sustainability – Environmental and Social \nLending in Rural Industries report noted that this might result in an effective price on sustainability: \nThe integration of ESG data into credit risk and underwriting processes \ncould effectively place a price on sustainability. In the future, the cost of \naccessing financial products at the farm gate may inherently be linked to a \nproducer’s ability to report their sustainability credentials to banks and \ninsurers.  \nHowever, data gaps and challenges were considered a li mitation for embedding, for example, environmental criteria \nin usual lending practices. These gaps may to some extent lessen with better mandatory and voluntary re porting \nframeworks such as the ARAS. The AgriFutures report noted that: \nNevertheless, shifting the fundamental processes underpinning rural \nlending will take significant resources, investment and, above all, time. […] \nTo advance sustainable financing solutions, the sector will need to \novercome a lack of fit-for-purpose data, bridge skill and capability gaps, \nand reduce the potential for additional administrative burden at the farm \ngate. \nImpact on agricultural property valuation \nIt is possible that the introduction of the ASRS and other reporting schemes such as the TNFD will impact agricultural \nproperty valuation. There are several ways to value agricultural properties (Eves, 2004). This can include: \n Direct comparison: Involves a valuer making (usuall y subjective) adjustments around the relative pros and \ncons of properties relative to one another.  \n Summation: Involves analysis of sales evidence to separate out levels for land class types, irrigatio n water \nentitlements, and/or structural improvements, which are applied to various components of property to be  \nvalued. \n Productivity: Commonly used for valuing extensive g razing properties and Involves analysis of sales evidence \nto show a rate per unit of livestock able to be carried. This is less relevant to cotton farms. \n Income: Involves an assessment of the likely futur e net return from a property and is rarely used to value \nagricultural properties. \n Discounted cash flow: Involves modelling the expect ed income and net profit from a farm and turning th is \ninto a purchase price, based on an expected rate of  return. This is generally regarded as a check meth od, \nas it requires many assumptions to be made around revenues and costs. \n \n \nRural land valuer Beaumont (2023) notes that every piece of farmland has unique traits that can affect its value, and \na valuer will consider recent sales data, similar pr operties, demand-supply dynamics and historical pri ce trends for \nrural land in the area. Importantly, they will note improvements made, and potential uses of the property, as “this can \ngreatly influence its market value”, and that clima te and water availability and how it is sourced are i mportant \nconsiderations. \nCBRE notes that, for cropping properties, analysis has often been undertaken on a ‘dollar per wheat tonne equivalent’ \n(WTE), which enables the productivity from a range of crops to be determined to a standard metric. However, analysis \nof rainfall and soil-type data is an alternative to this approach, and the use of DCF analysis is becoming increasingly \npopular. CBRE (2022) notes that DCF analysis has been used sparingly in the agricultural sector in the past, but the \nincreasing scale of properties and portfolios justifies the move to such an approach.   \nThe introduction of on-farm sustainability initiatives (such as bankless irrigation), and its resulting agronomic benefits \nand more efficient water and labour use, has the potential to flow through to the property valuation across a range of \nthe above-mentioned valuation methods. This can include for example as a subjective strength of the property and/or \na structural improvement in a summation approach. Cl imate-related risks and opportunities, including th e ability to \nbetter weather drought or water scarcity, can also im pact DCF valuations both in terms of projected cash-f lows and \nthe discount rate applied in the valuation. Higher risk typically leads to a higher discount rate, whic h lowers the \nmodelled purchase price.  \nThe introduction of mandatory climate-related risk and opportunities reporting, and the increasing use  of the TNFD \nframework, may result in an increase in the information requested and required by potential buyers relating to climate- \nand nature-related risks and opportunities, especially from potential buyers that report under the ASRS. A preference \nfor properties that fit within internal climate targets and climate-related transition plans (CTPs) may emerge for certain \npotential buyers, which may in turn be reflected in the purchase price. \nImpact on the cotton supply chain \nThe textile industry supply chain involves raw mater ial extraction, raw material processing, material pr oduction, \nfinished product assembly, and office/retail and distribution centers. Materials production is often a substantial source \nof emissions and requires significant amounts of wat er and chemistry. Retailers who are and will be report ing under \nthe ASRS will be looking across their supply chain fo r opportunities to reduce emissions and improve sus tainability \n(Fashion For Good, 2025). For the fashion supply ch ain, transparency and traceability are challenges, and brands \nand retailers may not be able identify the individu al farms that for example their cotton has originat ed from. Scope 3 \nemissions will likely make up a very significant pro portion of total emissions, and retailers will need to work to \nunderstand their scope 3 emissions and the climate risks and opportunities associated with these emissi ons across \ntheir supply chain (Jackson and Saldias, 2024).  \nThere may be risks and opportunities for cotton rel ating to demand from merchants and retailers followi ng the \nintroduction of ASRS (and/or other reporting require ments in their respective home countries, including  in the EU). \nAustralian cotton may become more attractive than c otton sourced from other parts of the world due to i nnovative \nwater and soil management practices and lower overall  emissions footprints. However, Australian cotton als o \ncompetes with other materials with sustainability cre dentials, such as organic cotton (free from pestici des and \nsynthetic fertilisers), hemp (naturally pest-resistant and requiring minimal water and inputs), and recycled PET (which \ndiverts plastic waste from landfills). Retailers will be selecting materials that align with their goals,  including their \nemissions and sustainability goals. That is, Austra lian cotton farms will not only be compared with one another in \nterms of their emissions footprint and sustainabili ty, but retailers will also be comparing the emissio ns footprint and \nsustainability of the entire value chains of potent ial different material compositions they can use to  create their final \nproducts (DTS, 2025).\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSurvey \nSurvey Question Design \nSurvey questions were developed considering findings  from the literature review, and specific to each o f irrigators, \nbanks, farm insurers, brands, and property valuation specialists. While a comprehensive list of survey questions has \nbeen collated in Appendix 1, only salient findings from interviews are presented in this section. \nSurvey Responses \nThis section provides an overview of survey particip ant feedback, collated from documented one-on-one \nconversations undertaken by telephone and face-to-face discussions during the research period. Following the review \nof literature a list of questions pertaining to the project scope were drafted to cover five sub-groups: Irrigators, valuation \nspecialists, agribusiness regional bankers, bank ex ecutives, farm insurers, and brands and retailers. Due to the \ncommercially sensitive nature of the survey questions and topics involved, all responses have been anonymised.  \nTNFD, ASRS, and Farmer Impacts \nDuring the phone survey, we interviewed irrigators, b anks, insurance companies, valuation specialists as  well as \nbrands and retailers.  \nAt a high level, land valuers had some knowledge of the compliance and regulation requirements associat ed with \nmandatory climate-related reporting but commented t hat it was just too early to impact sales valuation in any \nmeaningful way. Several field representatives for insurers and brokers surveyed had no knowledge of capturing data \nfrom farming and irrigator clients and lacked even a basic understanding of ASRS. Banks on the other ha nd were \nvery conversant with both ASRS and TNFD from sustainab ility from the rural branch staff to the corporate \nsustainability executives surveyed. Rural finance br okers representing a few top and second-tier banks were in \ndiscussions around collecting farm production data to convert to sustainability metrics for their bank ing customers. \nChallenges with surveying the brands and retail secto r were overcome by an intermediary in cotton working with \ncotton apparel brands on a weekly basis.  \nThe following section provides a summary of survey r esponses and has been grouped for ease of presentat ion and \nreadability. Illustrative quotes are provided to highlight core themes that emerged from the survey data collection. \n \n \nTable 2: TNF, ASRS and Farmer impacts – survey responses (all except irrigators) \nQuestion Banks \nN=7 \nValuer \nN=5 \nInsurer \nN=4 \nBrands & \nRetailer \nN=3  \nHow has and will the Taskforce on Nature-related \nFinancial Disclosures, impact on commercial \nloans/insurance/farm values for farmers that have, or \nwill, introduce sustainability and productivity initiatives \nsuch as bankless irrigation that improve system and \nclimate resilience? \nUnsure \n(43%) \n \nPositive \nbenefits \n(28%) \n \nIt won’t \n(29%) \nToo soon \n(100%) \nNo \nawareness \nNot \nApplicable \nAre you likely to be enquiring about total emissions \nand/or climate-related risks and opportunities on the \nfarm level because of the introduction of the ASRS? \n \n \nYes (86%) \n \nNo (14%) \nNot \nApplicable \nNo \nawareness \n \nYes (100%) \nAre you likely to be enquiring about total emissions \nand/or climate-related risks and opportunities on the \nfarm level because of the Taskforce on Nature-related \nFinancial Disclosures? \n \nNo (100%) Not \nApplicable \nNo \nawareness No (100%) \n \nDo you agree with the following statement: \n \n“In the future, the cost of accessing financial products at \nthe farm gate may inherently be linked to a producer’s \nability to report their sustainability credentials to banks and \ninsurers”.  \nYes (43%) \n \nNo (57%) \nNot \nApplicable \nNo \nawareness N/A \n \nDo you have a preference for a carbon calculator?

With the exception of insurers as supply \nchain laggards, brands, financiers and irrigators have had discussions with third parties relating to ASRS and TNFD \npolicies (Figure 4). \n \nFigure 4: Survey responses to TNFD and ASRS links \n\n \n \nThe TNFD is now virtually off the table in terms of priorities owing to the \n“Donald Trump effect” being that there has been a swing to the right and \npushing back on green compliance \n“Absolutely there will be a sustainability metric woven into financial \nproducts for the farming sector in the future.

The biggest constraint is \ngathering the required data, not inputting the data. You would be surprised \nhow analogue farmer input recording still is on some of the most advanced, \nwell-run farms. It’s very difficult to engage and push too hard, but we are \ngetting there, and it is time consuming. The bank has targets so we have to \nget on with it.”  \nRegional Bank Manager \n “We know we need farm emissions data in the coming years. Without a \ntraceability system in place, it’s a useless exercise as the cotton could be a \nblend of ten farms. We have no choice but to use industry proxies until the \ntraceability issue is sorted out.”  \nCotton Brand & Retailer  \nImplementing Bankless Irrigation \nOf the relevant sub-groups surveyed, four of the fi ve valuers and four out of seven irrigators agreed that \nimplementing bankless irrigation improved the farm valuation (Figure 5). \n \nFigure 5: Survey responses of improved valuation from implementing bankless irrigation \nSome notable responses from the survey relating to the effect of bankless irrigation on farm \nvaluations included the following quotes: \n \n“The exact amount of the increase is very hard to quantify from sales data. \nCategorically, side-by-side if there were two farms in the same area, one \nhad bankless and one didn’t, the bankless one would make more money”  \n\n \n \nValuer \n“The more remote the farm is, the more likely the farm is to achieve a \nbankless premium on the upper end of values over siphon irrigation due to \nthe scarcity of labour and other input efficiencies associated with this \nmethod”  \nValuer \n“I’ve had the discussion with my bank and valuation consultant and they \nboth reckon it won’t change my farm value”  \nIrrigator \nAmong those survey irrigator and valuer respondents (n=8) that agreed a land valuation would occur, the premium \nattached to the bankless favored a range between $500 and $2,000 / Ha. The results are shown in Figure 6. \n \nFigure 6: Estimated uplift installing bankless over siphon irrigation (n=8) \nSome notable responses from the survey relating to the potential for a land valuation uplift \nfrom bankless irrigation included the following quotes: \n“There are too many moving parts in a transaction e.g. water values which \ncan be moved around to minimise stamp duty, to properly isolate the \nbankless proportion and measure it.”  \nValuer \n“I’ve had banks and valuers look at these issues and 20 per cent above a \ntraditional siphon system is about the mark. As an irrigator, if you can make \n\n \n \nthe conversion work without having to outlay big amounts to upgrade \npumps, it’s a great financial decision. I can move water off my fields in a \ndownpour much easier now as well which helps the crop yield immensely.”  \nIrrigator \nConverting siphon irrigation systems to bankless can be a capital-intensive exercise. Banks were asked “if they were \naware of the benefits of bankless irrigation in term s of water savings, energy savings, better nitrogen  use efficiency \nand lower nitrous oxide emissions from faster applic ations of water”. Those on-ground bankers with cotto n clients \nwere aware of bankless, although some of the sustainability experts in higher management were not.  \nWe asked both irrigators and banks if specialist lo ans with more favourable terms were offered, with the \naforementioned sustainability benefits in mind. No i rrigator contacted for the phone survey (n=7) had r eceived \npreferential loan terms for bankless installation. However, one major listed bank was particularly enthusiastic about a \ncredit discount for farm improvements that offered sustainability benefits, such as those attributed t o bankless. The \nscale of benefit in the variable loan discount was “ commensurate to those obtained from the CEFC”, which c an be \naround 0.1-1.5% reduction (Clean Energy Finance Corporation, 2025). \n \n \nFigure 7: Per cent of banks offering, or irrigators receiving favourable loan terms \nSome notable responses relating to potential favourable loan terms on sustainability \ngrounds from installing bankless included the following quotes: \n“Irrigators normally have a strong asset base by which to lend. The credit \nmarkets are very competitive, so no, we don’t offer special discounts on \nloan terms (reduced interest rates) for improving farm irrigation \ninfrastructure.”  \nRegional Bank Manager \n\n \n \n“No, I’ve never really asked the question to the bank about if bankless \nqualifies for better loan terms on environmental grounds. I certainly will \nthough using benefits from industry studies, on the next stage of \ndevelopment.”  \nIrrigator \n“Yes. We have environmental loan terms where bankless improvements \nsatisfy the criteria for an interest discount on those works, similar to the \nCEFC loan terms. Water and energy savings on farm are a priority.”  \nBank Executive \n  \n \n \nWhole of Farm Model Results \nIt is important to understand the farm level impact s of cotton industry research and new technologies. The objective \nin this section is to describe how farmers in cotton growing valleys typically have multiple enterprises in a whole farm \ncontext and to assess the change in financial perfo rmance of such farming systems. This is achieved by  the \ndevelopment of a Whole-Farm Model (WFM) for a representative farm identified by Powell and Scott (2011).  \nThe WFM provides a snapshot at a particular point i n time of a farm with a particular set of resources.  Hence while \nthis report may give a broad indication of what is h appening on many farms in the northern cropping reg ion of NSW \nand Qld, it may be inaccurate for farms with markedl y different soil type, climate and resources to tho se of the \nrepresentative farm.  \nThe WFM used for the purposes of measuring the chan ge in irrigation system from siphon to bankless con tains \ninformation gathered from available data, local con sensus groups and assumptions regarding the size of  a typical \nfarm and other resources, such as labour, overhead costs, assets and liabilities and the nature of the cropping rotation \nused. The breakdown of land use, water resources and values are shown in Table 3.  \nTable 3: Characteristics of the Lower Namoi representative farm \nCategory Metric Size(s) \nTotal farm area Hectares 1203 \nIrrigable land Hectares 782 \nMinimum area irrigated annually Hectares 250 \nPlanned bankless development Hectares 400/782 \nCost of bankless Dollars/ha  \nArea farmed – dryland Hectares 180 \nArea grazed Hectares 120 \nWater resources   \nGroundwater ML 2500 \nNamoi River allocation ML 1600 \nWater storage capacity ML 90 \nLand and water asset value Dollars 28,744,195 \nDebt facility Dollars 5,250,000 \nWithin the context of the farming system, the WFM was used to sensitivity test and measure impacts of the \nfollowing: \n Does the estimated flow-on land value appreciation from converting areas of bankless channel irrigation \nfrom siphons change the farm’s financial position? \n Test the model’s robustness under a range of basic  conversion costs and land appreciation benefits. \nThe investment analysis was conducted within a farm with the following assumptions (Table 4). The low/high cost \ndevelopment scenarios ($600/Ha and $4,200/Ha) were numbers derived from recent CottonInfo Bankless case \nstudies (Welsh, 2024b, Welsh, 2024a). \nTable 4: On-farm assumptions used in the WFM investment sensitivity analysis \nCotton yield = 12 bales/ha  Current water use = 10 ML/Ha  Bankless water use = 8 ML/Ha  \n Current irrigation labour = $330/ha Bankless labour = $100/ha \nBankless installation scenario 1 400 ha, cost scenarios $600/ha and \n$4,200 ha \nValuation uplift = $500/ha and \n$2,000/ha \nBankless installation scenario 2 782 ha, cost scenarios $600/ha and \n$4,200 ha \nValuation uplift = $500/ha and \n$2,000/ha \nThe first scenario explored a staged approach with 400 hectares of the available 782 hectares of irrigable land \ndeveloped. It is assumed that the development can be carried out without the loss of a cotton or wheat crop. The \nresults showed a resilient system under both high and low installation costs in combination with a flow-through \n \n \nvaluation sensitivity tested with a low ($500/Ha) and high ($2,000/Ha) valuation uplift (Figure Table 5).  \n \nFigure 8 a schematic of the sensitivity testing of various scenarios of installing bankless channel irrigation and its financial \nimpact on the Whole Farm Model  \nTable 5: Scenario 1 – developing 400 of 782 Ha to bankless under two cost and two flow-on valuation outcomes   \n400 Ha Development Costs $/Ha and $500/ha assuming (low) valuation uplift \nEconomic metric Base $600 $4,200 \nFarm Equity 82% 82% 77% \nReturn on equity 0.60% 0.40% 0.1 \n \n400 Ha Development Costs $/Ha and $2,000/ha (high) valuation uplift \nEconomic metric Base 600 4200 \nFarm Equity 82% 82% 77% \nReturn on equity 0.60% 0.50% 0.1% \n \nThe second scenario investigates the economic impac t on a whole farm level of developing both a high a nd \nlow-cost transition from siphons to bankless. On this occasion, the entire 782 Ha of irrigable land is developed. \nThe increase in farm debt from the development had little impact on the farm equity position and the r eturn on \nequity remained close to base case levels. However,  the higher cost scenario of $4,200/Ha resulted in a \nsignificant drop in farm equity (from 82% to 72%) a nd return on equity dipped below zero to -0.5%. The  higher \ninstallation costs accrued additional interest costs on a larger scale owing to the development of the whole area \n(Table 6). \nTable 6: Scenario 2 – developing all 782 Ha to bankless under two cost and valuation outcomes  \n782 Ha Development Costs $/Ha and $500/ha (low) val uation uplift \nEconomic metric Base 600 4200 \nFarm Equity 82% 81% 71% \nReturn on equity 0.6% 0.5% -0.5% \n \n782 Ha Development Costs $/Ha and $2,000/ha (high) valuation uplift \nEconomic metric Base 600 4200 \nFarm Equity 82% 82% 72% \nReturn on equity 0.6% 0.5% -0.5% \nLow \ndevelopment \ncosts \nLow \nvaluation \nHigh \ndevelopment \ncosts \nLow \nvaluation \nLow \ndevelopment \ncosts \nHigh \nValuation \nHigh \ndevelopment \ncosts \nHigh \nvaluation \n \n \nConclusion \nThe introduction of mandatory climate-related reporting means that many large companies and institutions, including \nfarms, which meet certain criteria around revenue, g ross assets, or number of employees are, or will be,  required to \nreport on their emissions. This includes scopes 1 and 2 emissions in the first instance, followed by scope 3 emissions. \nSmaller entities that are not required to report di rectly may need to supply their emissions data to t hird parties within \ntheir supply chain, so that their supply chain can meet scope 3 emissions requirements. However, if it is unduly difficult \nor expensive to obtain direct farm-specific primary data on emissions, reporting entities are permitted to use secondary \ndata including industry averages. In the case of cotton, traceability thorough the supply chain is complex, and reporting \nentities within the supply chain such as brands and  retailers may use secondary and averaged farm data  initially for \nthis reason. This will likely limit the widespread im pact on farmers in the near term from within the sup ply chain. \nHowever, banks and insurers are not directly affected  by cotton supply chain opaqueness (in the way brand s and \nretailers are, for example), and may request sustainability data directly from their clients. \nA survey of rural lending and farm insurers revealed strong activity from the banking sector on engaging their farmer \nclients in collecting on-farm emissions data. One hundred per cent of all banks and finance brokers surveyed reported \nhaving had discussions with farmers linked to ASRS co mpliance. In contrast, the insurance industry broke rs and \nrepresentatives in farm underwriting surveyed had no awareness and were not conversant in understanding reporting \nrequirements. Bankers surveyed were also aware of voluntary TNFD reporting and obligations, however respondents \nalluded to the recent “Trump effect” of railing aga inst environmental regulation. TNFD seems to have fal len into that \ncategory and has slipped off the radar of banks at present. A broad cross-section of attitudes existed  towards the \ndata required and the approach to data collection f rom cotton and farming businesses. Most banks have opted to \nchoose a user-friendly data portal and encourage ad option through information days and subsidising acc ess to \ngenerate reports. Those in the minority had chosen to use proxy industry values or estimates from input suppliers to \ncollect data for their ASRS requirements.  \nBanks, when asked if accessing ASRS reporting require ments from farmers were likely to create a “price on  \nsustainability for credit” in the future, a mixed r esponse ensued with almost half of responses claimin g, “it’s already \nhappening” to “the credit market is already too competitive to drafting discounts and premiums among clients”.  \nWhile the study did not engage brands and retailers directly, the survey responses suggested that scope 3 reporting \nremains purely academic until a rigorous traceability scheme can be implemented to track the source of fibre to farm. \nLarge companies in this sector that are required to  report are noted to be content with using secondary  data to fulfil \nASRS requirements. One potential impact of the ASRS f rom the perspective of brands and retailers may be that it \nbecomes more accessible to compare different materials such as organic cotton, hemp, or recycled PET (or material \ncompositions) against each other based on emissions  footprint, even if this relies on secondary data. With greater \nclimate-related reporting, emissions intensity may play an increasing role as one of several pieces of information that \nbrands and retailers assess when deciding what materi als or material compositions to use. In this contex t, it will be \nimportant to have locally relevant methods and emissions factors for cotton in line with emergence guidance to ensure \nthat the emissions footprint of Australian cotton is not overestimated by for example using international defaults. \nAs the irrigated cotton industry experiences a shif t to more resilient systems that can adapt to extre me weather \nconditions, reduce inputs without compromising yield , and produce higher output per labour unit there m ay be small \nbenefits for agri-finance and ASRS strategy reportin g. A minority group of banks surveyed had plans or finance \nproducts in place to offer more competitive credit for investing in more efficient irrigation infrastructure if environmental \ngains could be proven. Separately, bankless irrigat ion does satisfy the main criteria as a strategy fo r specifically \ndealing with several risks under the AASB S2 core to pics : “the climate resilience of the entity’s strategy and its \nbusiness model to climate-related changes, developments and uncertainties considering the identified climate-related \nrisks and opportunities”.  The time when such information may be useful for small businesses to satisfy more detailed \nstrategy documentation above scope 3 emissions reporting requirements is unclear. \nA survey of specialist property valuers and irrigators found the flow on monetary gains to asset valuation following the \ninstallation of bankless systems can be in the rang e of $500 to $2,000 per hectare, with the access to labour as the \nprimary driver. An economic analysis using a WFM ap proach sensitivity tested these valuation uplift sc enarios with \ntwo installation cost outcomes ($600/Ha and $4,200/Ha)  each investigating 400 Ha and 782 Ha of development \nrespectively. The overall equity position of the fa rm, considering a 20 per cent water saving and $230/ Ha labour \nsaving under the new operating scenario, the WFM was a very resilient system with a strong asset and earning base. \n \n \nOnly in the high cost ($4,200), low valuation (+$500/Ha uplift) and the whole-of-farm development did return on assets \nand return on equity erode considerably, owing in pa rt to the relatively conservative Debt/Equity ratio  of 82 per cent. \nPresent day assets and earnings are applied to the WFM. These results are exploratory only and should be viewed \nas a snapshot at a particular location at a particular point in time. It may be inaccurate for farms with markedly different \nsoil types, climate and resources to those of the Lower Namoi Valley representative farm. \nAvenues for future research include a second round of engagement with insurers (why?), brands and retail ers \n(because of above) to better understand the future needs of Scope 3 emissions reporting and potential biodiversity \nmeasurements for market access. A suite of online t ools, like carbon emissions reporting tools, can pr oduce a \nbiodiversity “score” that can be measured and track ed over time. Each global customer can have a prefe rred \nmeasurement that may create market trade opportunit ies from one farm over another. The true benefits o f bankless \nirrigation developments through an uplift in value has not been explored in economic case studies to date, only project \ncosts and operational savings/benefits. Studies in remote areas will likely have a stronger business ca se capturing \nasset appreciation. Further analysis is also requir ed to test the model on staging developments carefu lly for a high-\ndebt situation to better understand the rollout of developments under a range of future water availability scenarios. \n \n  \n \n \nAppendix 1 \nSurvey Questions \nIrrigators: \n When did you introduce bankless irrigation? \n Has the introduction of bankless improved productiv ity (i.e. labour/water/fertiliser) on your farm? \n Have you had any interactions with banks and/or prop erty valuation specialists pre- or post- the introduction \nof bankless irrigation where the role of bankless irrigation was discussed and/or explicitly considered? \n If yes, how did the introduction of bankless irriga tion impact the loan terms (interest rate, duration, other) \nand/or property valuation? \n What, if there are any, discussions have you had wi th entities within your supply chain (for example \nsuppliers or buyers) where the benefits of bankless irrigation have featured?   \n Have you had any discussions or requests from within  your supply chain to report on your total emissions \nor sustainability initiatives, either directly linked to the introduction of mandatory reporting on climate-related \nrisks and opportunities, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, or separately? \nBanks: \n Are you aware of the benefits of bankless irrigatio n in terms of water savings, energy savings, better \nnitrogen use efficiency and lower emissions from faster and more uniform applications of water? \n Have you issued any commercial loans to properties where bankless irrigation has been introduced? \n If yes, how did bankless irrigation impact the term s of the loan offered and why, compared to traditional \nirrigation?
